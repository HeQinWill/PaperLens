10.1088/1748-9326/adb448,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文探讨了地球能量不平衡与海洋变暖之间的关系。它利用卫星观测数据、海洋表面温度以及ERA5大气再分析数据，研究了地球净能量不平衡的变化及其对海洋表面变暖的影响。研究发现，地球能量不平衡的加倍主要归因于海洋上空云辐射效应导致的太阳光吸收增加，特别是加利福尼亚和纳米比亚的层积云区域以及南极海冰的减少。此外，论文还分析了地球能量不平衡与近全球海洋年变暖之间的关系，并探讨了2022年至2023年海洋表面大幅变暖的原因，认为这与混合层深度减小或混合层下方热通量方向的逆转有关。总的来说，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来研究地球能量平衡和气候变化，涉及云、海冰等大气成分和现象的分析。,"[""Earth's energy imbalance"", 'Ocean warming', 'Satellite observations', 'Cloud-radiative effects', 'Absorbed sunlight', 'Reflected sunlight', 'Stratocumulus clouds', 'Antarctic sea ice', 'ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis']",Richard P Allan;Christopher J Merchant,Reconciling Earth’s growing energy imbalance with ocean warming,"Rising greenhouse gas concentrations and declining global aerosol emissions are causing energy to accumulate in Earth’s climate system at an increasing rate. Incomplete understanding of increases in Earth’s energy imbalance and ocean warming reduces the capability to accurately prepare for near term climate change and associated impacts. Here, satellite-based observations of Earth’s energy budget and ocean surface temperature are combined with the ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis over 1985–2024 to improve physical understanding of changes in Earth’s net energy imbalance and resulting ocean surface warming. A doubling of Earth’s energy imbalance from 0.6±0.2 Wm−2 in 2001–2014 to 1.2±0.2 Wm−2 in 2015–2023 is primarily explained by increases in absorbed sunlight related to cloud-radiative effects over the oceans. Observed increases in absorbed sunlight are not fully captured by ERA5 and determined by widespread decreases in reflected sunlight by cloud over the global ocean. Strongly contributing to reduced reflection of sunlight are the Californian and Namibian stratocumulus cloud regimes, but also recent Antarctic sea ice decline in the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea. An observed increase in near-global ocean annual warming by 0.1 for each 1 Wm−2 increase in Earth’s energy imbalance is identified over an interannual time-scale (2000–2023). This is understood in terms of a simple ocean mixed layer energy budget only when assuming no concurrent response in heat flux below the mixed layer. Based on this simple energy balance approach and observational evidence, the large observed near-global ocean surface warming of 0.27  from 2022 to 2023 is found to be physically consistent with the large energy imbalance of 1.85±0.2 Wm−2 from August 2022 to July 2023 but only if (1) a reduced depth of the mixed layer is experiencing the heating or (2) there is a reversal in the direction of heat flux beneath the mixed layer associated with the transition from La Niña to El Niño conditions. This new interpretation of the drivers of Earth’s energy budget changes and their links to ocean warming can improve confidence in near term warming and climate projections."

This extreme heat was accompanied by widespread fires across London and elsewhere in England, which destroyed houses and prompted evacuations. While attribution studies have identified a strong human fingerprint contributing to the heatwave, no studies have attributed the associated fires to anthropogenic influence. In this study, we assess the contribution of human-induced climate change to fire weather conditions over the summer of 2022 using simulations from the HadGEM3-A model with and without anthropogenic emissions and apply the Canadian Fire Weather Index. Our analysis reveals at least a 6-fold increase in the probability of very high fire weather in the UK due to human influence, most of which is driven by high fire conditions across England. These findings highlight the significant role of human-induced climate change in emerging UK wildfires. As we experience more hotter and drier summers as temperatures continue to rise the frequency and severity of fires are likely to increase, posing significant risks to both natural ecosystems and human populations. This study underscores the need for further research to quantify the changing fire risk due to our changing climate and the urgent requirement for mitigation and adaptation efforts to address the growing wildfire threat in the UK."

Several assumptions were made when framing conventions that remain in practice, however recent advances offer potentially more consistent and inclusive accounting of greenhouse gases. We apply these advances, namely: consistent gross accounting of CO2 sources; linking land use emissions with sectors; using emissions-based effective radiative forcing (ERF) rather than global warming potentials to compare emissions; including both warming and cooling emissions, and including loss of additional sink capacity. We compare these results with conventional accounting and find that this approach boosts perceived carbon emissions from deforestation, and finds agriculture, the most extensive land user, to be the leading emissions sector and to have caused 60% (32%–87%) of ERF change since 1750. We also find that fossil fuels are responsible for 18% of ERF, a reduced contribution due to masking from cooling co-emissions. We test the validity of this accounting and find it useful for determining sector responsibility for present-day warming and for framing policy responses, while recognising the dangers of assigning value to cooling emissions, due to health impacts and future warming."

While it is clear that sweeping deforestation by miners has resulted in substantial loss of above-ground carbon stocks and increased greenhouse emissions, the region also harbors a sizable below-ground carbon stock in the form of peatlands, and how these have fared against decades of mining expansion is uncertain. Here, we use Landsat’s continuous archival record spanning over 35 years to monitor the expansion of gold mining in a major Amazonian peat complex along the alluvial plain of the Madre de Dios River. We detect over 550 ha of peatland surface area that has been lost to gold mining, potentially accounting for between 0.2 and 0.7 Tg of emitted below-ground carbon. Alarmingly, the majority of this loss (55%) has occurred within the past two years. Mining inside peatlands currently accounts for 9% of total mining, but projections suggest a 25% share by 2027 as mining within peatland is accelerating considerably faster than mining in the alluvial plain as a whole. The startling surge of peatland degradation is synchronous with the arrival of an aggressive mining front into the most distal reaches of the alluvial plain where peatlands are most abundant. Already, 63 of 219 peatlands in the alluvial plain show evidence of mining within their borders, putting over 10 000 ha of peatland area and between 3.5 and 14.5 TgC at imminent risk. The rapid proliferation of gold mining inside peatlands appears to be of such scope as to be an existential threat to the entire peatland complex."

This study examined the spatio-temporal LULC dynamics around the Budongo Central Forest from 1995 to 2022 and the implications these changes have on the provision of ecosystem services and the livelihoods of local communities. Data were collected using a hybrid approach involving satellite image classification, post-classification change detection, interviews with 156 respondents and 17 key informants. Survey data were subjected to descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions. The study results reveal a decline in areas covered by wetlands, forests and grasslands due to the expansion of commercial sugarcane plantations, compounded by an increase in the population emanating from migrant workers. While the area under subsistence agriculture had a marginal expansion, local communities perceived that the changes in LULC resulted in a decline in households’ food availability, water availability and soil fertility. The study concludes that changes in LULC are associated with significant losses in natural assets and ecosystems. These loses in natural assets have significant effects on the livelihoods of community members. Therefore, there is a need for instituting a participatory land use planning approach in the affected communities to mitigate the effects of the LULC changes. This will also help in fostering sustainable natural resource management within the affected communities."
10.1088/1748-9326/adb985,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注美国干旱地区的植被生长趋势与气候驱动因素之间的关系，特别是降水的影响。它使用MODIS NDVI数据分析了2001-2020年间的植被绿度变化，并探讨了降水、温度等因素对植被的影响。虽然使用了遥感数据（MODIS NDVI），但其重点在于植被生态和气候变化，而非大气环境遥感技术本身，例如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。,"['MODIS', 'NDVI', 'Vegetation', 'Precipitation', 'Drylands', 'Climate Change']",Yuhe Chang;Alexander J Winkler;Amirhossein Noori;Yuri Knyazikhin;Ranga B Myneni,Precipitation leads the long-term vegetation increase in the conterminous United States drylands,"Drylands, encompassing over 40% of the conterminous United States (CONUS), are crucial to the global carbon cycle and highly susceptible to climate change. However, Earth system models offer conflicting projections of future drought and vegetation activity in North America, and in-depth analyses of the long-term changes in greenness and its relationship with underlying climate drivers, considering both spatial and temporal variations at the ecosystem scale, are lacking. This study analyzes 20 year (2001–2020) MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) observations to assess greenness trends in CONUS drylands and their relationship with climate drivers at 1 km spatial resolution. Results indicate a large scale and systematic greening trend, particularly in the northern Great Plains (NGP) region. Using an empirical linear attribution approach and empirical orthogonal function analysis, we uncover varied relationships between greenness trends and climate drivers, particularly highlighting the dominant role of increased precipitation in driving the observed greening. Trend analysis reveals that while rain use efficiency (RUE) remains stable in most areas, increases in the NGP region suggest potential CO2 fertilization effects, while decreases in southern states correlate with rising temperatures. We also develop an efficiency-based model featuring RUE which successfully reproduces historical NDVI, re-confirming the dominant influence of precipitation in local greenness interannual variability. However, CMIP6 projections for 2021–2040 under the ‘Regional Rivalry’ scenario (SSP370) paint a worrying picture, with projected browning in the NGP region and states near the 42°N latitude, contrasting recent greening trends. This potential reversal underscores the vulnerability of these ecosystems to future climate change, highlighting the need to consider both historical trends and future climate projections when assessing the resilience of drylands ecosystems. Overall, our work re-emphasizes the significance of water availability to drylands vegetation growth and contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of carbon-water cycling in arid and semi-arid regions."

Here, we examined spatio-temporal trends in aerosol-induced atmospheric warming and the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) and surface cooling over the Indian Subcontinent under clear-sky and all-sky conditions using clouds and the earth’s radiant energy system data for the period 2000–2021. Overall, the regional mean TOA and surface cooling were found to increase by 0.06 W m−2 yr−1 and 0.09 W m−2 yr−1, respectively. Over the last two decades, the aerosol-induced atmospheric warming in all-sky conditions increased over the subcontinent landmass and outflow regions over the ocean while it declined over dust-dominated arid regions. This dipole pattern was driven by a combination of an overall increase in aerosol optical depth, a gradual increase in the fraction of scattering aerosols over the Indian landmass dominated by anthropogenic sources, a decline in dust loading over the arid sources. As a result, atmospheric warming efficiency declined in most parts of the Indian subcontinent. A comparative meta-analysis revealed that aerosol-induced atmospheric warming was over-estimated by the existing studies where aerosol direct radiative forcings were estimated by 1-D radiative transfer model utilizing modeled optical properties based on incomplete information about in-situ physico-chemical properties derived from ground-based measurements. Our analysis showed that TOA and surface cooling by aerosols were higher in clear-sky conditions relative to the actual all-sky condition by up to 11 W m−2 and 16 W m−2, respectively; therefore, atmospheric warming reported for clear-sky conditions would be biased high over the subcontinent. As India embarked on a clean air mission, changes in aerosol loading and its composition are expected to alter the dipole pattern further in the future, impacting the regional climate via dynamic feedback."

However, to date, knowledge of the trade-offs and synergies between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nitrogen (N) reduction, carbon sequestration, and food provisioning under different agricultural practices remains limited, with most studies focusing on global and national scales. The present study implements the generalized representation of agro-food system model coupled with the soil organic carbon (SOC) AMG model in the Tuojiang River Basin, China, to assess the effects of 24 agricultural scenarios on SOC stock, the GHG budget, nitrogen (N) surplus, and export capacity at the county level in 2035. We considered viable options by modifying four levers: (i) synthetic fertilizer inputs, (ii) livestock population size and the fraction of animal proteins in the human diet, (iii) the share of legumes in crop rotation, and (iv) the proportion of straw used for bioenergy production. We found that the potential of biofuels to substitute fossil fuel emissions remains low across all scenarios, reducing by 2.9%–5.3% of current emissions. Our results also reveal synergies in reducing GHG emissions and N pollution, with reductions of 39%–43% and 26%–52%, respectively, under agro-ecological scenarios with zero N fertilizer application and halving of the livestock population. In contrast, trade-offs were identified between SOC sequestration and export capacity, both of which were lower in agro-ecological scenarios than in the others."

Maasakkers;Hannah Nesser;Zhen Qu;Yuzhong Zhang;John Worden,What can we learn about tropospheric OH from satellite observations of methane?,"The hydroxyl radical (OH) destroys many air pollutants, including methane. Global-mean OH cannot be directly measured, and thus it is inferred with the methyl chloroform (MCF) proxy. MCF is decreasing, and a replacement is needed. We use satellite observations of methane in two spectral ranges as a proxy for OH. We find shortwave infrared observations can characterize yearly OH and its seasonality but not the latitudinal distribution. Thermal infrared observations add little information. 
 The hydroxyl radical (OH) is the main oxidant in the troposphere and controls the lifetime of many atmospheric pollutants, including methane. Global annual-mean tropospheric OH concentrations ([OH‾]) have been inferred since the late 1970s using the methyl chloroform (MCF) proxy. However, concentrations of MCF are now approaching the detection limit, and a replacement proxy is urgently needed. Previous inversions of GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) satellite measurements of methane in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) have shown success in quantifying [OH‾] independently of methane emissions, and observing system simulations have suggested that satellite measurements in the thermal infrared (TIR) may provide additional constraints on OH. Here we combine SWIR and TIR satellite observations from the GOSAT and AIRS instruments, respectively, in a 3-year (2013–2015) analytical Bayesian inversion optimizing both methane emissions and OH concentrations. We examine how much information can be obtained about the interannual, seasonal, and latitudinal features of the OH distribution. We use information from MCF data and the ACCMIP ensemble of global atmospheric chemistry models to construct a full prior error covariance matrix for OH concentrations for use in the inversion. This is essential to avoid an overfitting of the observations. Our results show that GOSAT alone is sufficient to quantify [OH‾] and its interannual variability independently of methane emissions and that AIRS adds little information. The ability to constrain the latitudinal variability of OH is limited by strong error correlations. There is no information on OH at midlatitudes, but there is some information on the NH/SH interhemispheric ratio, showing this ratio to be lower than currently simulated in models. There is also some information on the seasonal variation in OH concentrations, although it mainly confirms the variation simulated by the models."

To better understand the mechanisms by which aerosol influences thunderstorms, we look at the two busiest shipping lanes in the world, where recent regulations have reduced sulfur emissions by nearly an order of magnitude. We find that the reduction in emissions has been accompanied by a dramatic decrease in both lightning and the number of droplets in clouds over the shipping lanes. 
 Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent 7-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol number-size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40 %. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment."

Supercooled liquid water and conical graupel are likely present, while chain-like ice crystals may occur at cloud top. Ice crystals are vertically aligned seconds before lightning and resume their usual horizontal alignment afterwards in some cases. Updrafts and downdrafts are found near cloud core and edges respectively. Turbulence is strong. Radar measurement modes that are more suited for investigating thunderstorms are recommended. 
 Lightning is a natural phenomenon that can be dangerous to humans. It is therefore challenging to study thunderstorm clouds using direct observations since it can be dangerous to fly into them. In this study, a cloud radar at 35 GHz with 45° elevation is used to study the properties and dynamics of thunderstorm clouds. It is based on a thunderstorm case on 18 June 2021 from 16:10 to 17:45 UTC near Cabauw, the Netherlands. The observed thunderstorm was associated with severe weather conditions over The Netherlands, attributed to the remnants of storm “Bill”. The time and location of individual lightning strikes are determined using the BLIDS system, operated by Siemens, which is based on the time-of-arrival principle. Concurrently, spectral polarimetry in the millimetre band – an innovative technique not previously applied in thunderstorm cloud studies – is employed to elucidate the behaviour of various particle types within a radar resolution volume. Spectral polarimetric radar variables are also used to look for vertical alignment of ice crystals that is expected due to electric torque. Due to challenges posed by non-Rayleigh scattering, scattering simulations are carried out to aid the interpretation of spectral polarimetric variables. It is shown that the start of the Mie regime in the Doppler spectrum can be clearly identified by the use of the spectral differential phase. Furthermore, variations in the location of the first Mie minimum across different spectral polarimetric variables may be attributed to different sensitivities of these variables to particle shape and ice fraction. From the results, there is a high chance that supercooled liquid water and conical graupel are present in the investigated thunderstorm clouds. There is also a possibility of ice crystals arranged in chains at the cloud top. Ice crystals become vertically aligned a few seconds before lightning and return to their usual horizontal alignment afterwards. However, this phenomenon has been witnessed in only a few cases of cloud-to-cloud lightning, specifically when the lightning strike is in close proximity to the radar's line of sight or when the lightning is strong. Doppler analyses show that updrafts are found near the core of the thunderstorm cloud, while downdrafts are observed at the edges. Strong turbulence is also observed as shown by the large Doppler spectrum width."

 Quantitative measurements of atmospheric total OH reactivity (kOH′) provide crucial insights into atmospheric photochemistry. However, widespread application of total OH reactivity measurements is challenging due to insufficient equipment and the complexity of existing instrumentation. In this work, we report the development of a portable laser-flash photolysis Faraday rotation spectroscopy (LP-FRS) instrument for real-time and in situ measurement of kOH′. To achieve efficient overlapping between the pump and probe laser and realize a long effective absorption path length, thus enabling high-sensitivity measurement, a specific Herriott-type pump–probe optical multi-pass cell was designed. The instrument's optical box dimensions were 130 cm × 40 cm × 35 cm. The obtained effective absorption path was ∼ 28.5 m in a base length of 77.2 cm. The kOH′ detection precisions of the LP-FRS instrument were 2.3 and 1.0 s−1 with averaging times of 60 and 300 s, respectively. The kOH′ measurement uncertainty was evaluated to be within 2 s−1. Field measurement was performed, and the difference between the measured kOH′ and the model simulated from the measured reactive species was analysed. The developed portable LP-FRS instrument extends the measurement methods of atmospheric total OH reactivity and has certain advantages in terms of cost, operation, and transportation, which will play an increasingly important role in future atmospheric chemistry research."

The geospatial data presented in the article correspond to the contextual indicators of the monitoring and evaluation framework of the Common Agricultural Policy. Our exploratory analysis reveals several interesting patterns which contribute to the broader debate on the future of European agriculture. 
 International organizations have voiced the need to integrate geographical information from agricultural holdings into official statistics to gain a better understanding of the spatial dynamics of the European agricultural sector. This paper presents a set of thematic maps based on the European 2020 agricultural census to explore the major structural differences between regions and countries. To comply with the confidentiality requirements associated with the census data, we applied a multi-resolution gridded approach by varying the resolution of the grid cells as a function of the density, dominance, and quality of individual observations. The data sets contain a mixture of grid resolutions ranging from 1 km to 40 km, preserving a hierarchical structure where higher resolution grids are aggregated into lower levels until the statistical disclosure requirements are met. The variables presented here correspond to the Contextual Indicators of the Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Framework of the Common Agricultural Policy and are divided into three broad categories: structural components (i.e., agricultural holdings, land use, livestock patterns, and labor input); the demographics of farmers (i.e., age, gender, and skills); and agricultural production methods (i.e., irrigation and organic farming). Our exploratory analysis indicates that high farm density occurs in plains and lowlands, as well as fertile soil areas in valleys, high shares of organic farming tend to be concentrated in certain areas with high proportions of grassland, and agricultural holdings managed by young farmers are located in a belt stretching from France through to Switzerland, Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, and Poland. These novel data sets are highly versatile, allowing not only policies to evaluate funding schemes at more local levels, but they also offer researchers new opportunities to draw causal spatial inference from the multi-resolution gridded data.

Combined with climate emulators, emIAM enables development of cost-effective, multi-IAM emission pathways directly linked to temperature targets at low computational cost. 
 We developed an emulator for integrated assessment models (emIAM) based on a marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve approach. Drawing on the output of IAMs in the Exploring National and Global Actions to reduce Greenhouse gas Emissions (ENGAGE) Scenario Explorer and the GET model, we derived an extensive array of MAC curves, encompassing 10 IAMs, at the global and regional levels for 10 regions; three gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O); eight portfolios of available mitigation technologies; and two emission sources. We tested the performance of emIAM by coupling it with the simple climate model ACC2 (ACC2–emIAM). Our analysis showed that the optimizing climate–economy model ACC2–emIAM adequately reproduced a majority of the original IAM emission outcomes under similar conditions. This can facilitate systematic exploration of IAMs with small computational resources. emIAM holds the potential to enhance the capabilities of simple climate models as a tool for calculating cost-effective pathways directly aligned with temperature targets."

In this paper, we are addressing the question of (radio)cobalt speciation upon bioaccumulation in the sentinel organism Mytilus galloprovincialis after in vivo contamination in a pseudo-natural system. For this study, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and gamma spectroscopy were used to quantify the cobalt distribution in the various organs: hepatopancreas, gills, visceral mass, mantle, foot, and byssus, as well as in subcellular compartments. Two X-ray spectroscopic techniques were used to decipher cobalt speciation and localization, bulk X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS with EXAFS and XANES regimes), and micro X-ray fluorescence imaging (μ-XRF). Lastly, secondary ion mass spectrometry images provided information on cobalt distribution at a subcellular scale. The accumulation of cobalt exhibits significant differences depending on the origin of the individuals, with higher concentration factor values for mussels from the Toulon Naval Base (considered as polluted) compared to Villefranche sur Mer, France (considered as unpolluted). However, concentration in organs always follows the same order: byssus ≫ hepatopancreas ≫ other organs. In terms of spatial distribution, cobalt has been visualized in the hepatopancreas, revealing the presence of preferred zones within some digestive cells and this could be linked to detoxification mechanisms. Finally, the determination of speciation data using XAS suggested the presence of a Co(II)-metallothionein complex in the hepatopancreas and a potential Co(II)-mfp-1 complex in the byssus. While they can be challenging, accumulation and speciation studies in radioecology are essential steps for a comprehensive approach to the impact of trace metallic radionuclides on the marine biota."

TP269a (SMX-hydroxylamine) and TP178 were identified as the dominant TPs across the pH levels. The exclusive formation of 4-nitroso-SMX, 4-nitro-SMX, and TP518 at pH 3 highlighted the role of SO4•– in attacking the NH2. At pH 7 and 10, 3A5MI emerged as the dominant TP.

By incorporation of measurements and modeling, 10–40% of furan SOA masses can be lost by direct photolysis under solar radiation over their typical atmospheric lifetime. The mass loss fraction is well correlated with the mass fraction of nitrogen-containing compounds (NOC) in the SOA, possibly because these species can largely enhance the light absorption cross section and readily undergo photodissociation under UV light."

Brittle tremor patches embedded in the ductile matrix deforming aseismically is the most common concept for the fault structure, but whether tremors and their patches impact the SSE initiation is under debate. This study focuses on 13 initiations of major Cascadia ETS. Limited observational constraints exist on the details of ETS initiation because spatiotemporal SSE inversions usually over‐smooth their temporal evolution. Scrutinizing tremors and SSE at the beginning of major ETS events gives us insights into their mechanical relationship. We directly retrieve the temporal evolution of the SSE moment by stacking sub‐daily Global Positioning System (GPS) time series at multiple sites, without slip inversions. Comparison of the GPS stack with tremor count demonstrates that SSE moment release accelerates drastically ∼ ${\sim} $1 day after the onset of vigorous tremor activity. On the other hand, once the SSE moment release accelerates, the tremor area expands more rapidly, suggesting that the growth of the ETS occurs through a feedback mechanism between slip and tremor once the SSE is well developed. By combining these and previous observations, we propose a conceptual model of ETS initiation: heterogeneous interface strength limits the growth of SSE with unruptured tremor patches acting as relatively high‐strength pins contributing to this heterogeneity. In other words, major ETS emerges probably only when collective tremor patches are critically stressed."

Here, we analyzed the exceptional scale, dominant driving factors, and potential impacts on permafrost of these wildfires using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer burned area (BA) observations and machine learning methods. We found that the 2023 coast‐to‐coast wildfires raged a staggering area of 13.02 Mha, more than seven times the historical average (2001–2022). The extreme wildfires were predominantly driven by record‐breaking drought, characterized by heightened atmospheric aridity and reduced precipitation, with specific water deficit thresholds triggering sharp increases in BA. Over 80% of the 2023 wildfires occurred in Canada's permafrost regions, with burned areas increasing more than six‐fold across extensive permafrost, including Arctic regions. These wildfires are expected to accelerate permafrost degradation and considerable carbon release from thawing, presenting previously overlooked risks. Our results emphasize the urgent need for immediate climatic action to mitigate climate change and pressures from wildfire and permafrost degradation."

 The interaction between glacier fronts and ocean waters is one of the key uncertainties for projecting future ice mass loss. Direct observations at glacier fronts are sparse, but studies indicate that the magnitude and timing of freshwater fluxes are crucial in determining fjord circulation, ice frontal melt and ecosystem habitability. In particular, wintertime dynamics are severely understudied due to inaccessible conditions, leading to a bias towards summer observations. Here we present in situ observations of temperature and salinity acquired in late winter in Greenland at the front of a marine-terminating glacier and in surrounding fjords. Our observations indicate the existence of an anomalously fresh pool of water by the glacier front, suggesting that meltwater generated at the bed of the glacier discharges during winter. The results suggest that warm Atlantic water and nutrients are entrained at the glacier front, leading to enhanced frontal melt and increased nutrient levels. Our findings have implications for understanding the heat exchange between glacier fronts and ocean waters, glacier frontal melt rates, ocean mixing and currents, and biological productivity.

Here, the authors show how airway epithelial structure impacts clearance by mapping cilia distribution, comparing human and rat airways, and developing quantitative models to assess function. 
 Mucociliary clearance is a vital defense mechanism of the human airways, protecting against harmful particles and infections. When this process fails, it contributes to respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. While advances in single-cell transcriptomics have revealed the complexity of airway composition, much of what we know about how airway structure impacts clearance relies on animal studies. This limits our ability to create accurate human-based models of airway diseases. Here we show that the airways in female rats and in humans exhibit species-specific differences in the distribution of ciliated and secretory cells as well as in ciliary beat, resulting in significantly higher clearance effectiveness in humans. We further reveal that standard lab-grown cultures exhibit lower clearance effectiveness compared to human airways, and we identify the underlying structural differences. By combining diverse experiments and physics-based modeling, we establish universal benchmarks to assess human airway function, interpret preclinical models, and better understand disease-specific impairments in mucociliary clearance.

Here, the authors use the confinement effect and low-dose imaging to reveal the confined molecules and evaluate the strength of host-guest interactions in different material systems. 
 Atomic imaging of molecules and intermolecular interactions are of great significance for a deeper understanding of the basic physics and chemistry in various applications, but it is still challenging in electron microscopy due to their thermal mobility and beam sensitivity. Confinement effect and low-dose imaging method may efficiently help us achieve stable high-resolution resolving of molecules and their interactions. Here, we propose a general strategy to image the confined molecules and evaluate the strengths of host-guest interactions in three material systems by low-dose electron microscopy. Then, we change the guest molecules to analyze how each kind of interaction strength influences the imaging quality of these molecules by using a same parameter, the aspect ratios of imaged molecular projections. In the material systems of perovskites (ionic) and zeolites with adsorbed molecules (van der Waals), we can obtain a clear image of molecular configurations by enhancing host-guest interactions. Even in metal organic framework (coordination) system, the atomic structures and bonds of aromatics can be achieved. These results provide a general description on the relation between molecular images and interactions, making it possible to study more molecular behaviors in wide applications by real-space imaging.

 Photocatalysis provides a sustainable and environment-friendly strategy to produce H2O2, yet the catalytic efficiency of H2O2 overall photosynthesis (O2 + 2H2O → 2H2O2) needs to be further improved, especially in the absence of additional cocatalysts, photosensitizers and sacrificial agents.

 Visible quantum dot light-emitting diodes have satisfied commercial display requirements. However, near-infrared counterparts considerably lag behind due to the inferior quality of near-infrared quantum dots and limitations in device architecture suitable for near-infrared electroluminescence.

 Helical-helical polypeptide polymerized ionic liquid block copolymers (PPIL BCPs) are synthesized to investigate the role of helical structure on self-assembly and ionic conductivity. PPIL BCPs, consisting of a cationic polypeptide (PTPLG) with bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide) (TFSI) counterion and varying lengths connected to a length-fixed neutral poly-(γ-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) block, exhibit stable helical conformations with minimal glass transition (Tg) variation.

This morphology yields a 1.5 order of magnitude higher Tg- and volume fraction-normalized ionic conductivity and a morphology factor f > 0.8 compared to less ordered BCPs with f < 0.05 and f = 2/3 for ideal lamellae.

 Proteins with chemically regulatable phase separation are of great interest in the fields of biomolecular condensates and synthetic biology. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are the dominating building blocks of biomolecular condensates which often lack orthogonality and small-molecule regulation desired to create synthetic biomolecular condensates or membraneless organelles (MLOs).

In both E. coli and human U2OS cells, LplA can form orthogonal condensates, which can be specifically dissolved by its natural substrate, the small molecule lipoic acid and its analogue lipoamide.

 Accumulation of plastic waste in the environment is not only a pressing environmental problem but also a waste of resources. Developing chemically recyclable plastics is deemed a viable approach to address the ever-growing plastic crisis, but the synthesis of circular polyolefins remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a ring-strain matched concept for the tailored synthesis of circular polyolefins. By designing a well-defined 16-membered unsaturated lactone (Ester-16), a family of chemically recyclable, high-molecular-weight, high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-like materials is produced by the copolymerization of cyclooctene (COE) with Ester-16, followed by exhaustive hydrogenation. These HDPE-like materials have the desirable bulk properties of HDPE. They can be degraded into a well-defined and easily separable macromonomer, specifically AB-like telechelic PE. The molecular weight of the macromonomer can be precisely tailored as required and depends solely on the feed ratio of [COE]/[Ester-16]. The recycled macromonomer can be easily repolymerized into a high-molecular-weight HDPE-like material. This macromonomer–polymer–macromonomer lifecycle rather than monomer–polymer–monomer lifecycle can be repeated with quantitative yields using a facile isolation process. Overall, this work opens opportunities to improve the sustainability of plastics.

 Disruptions in global food and energy trade can trigger cascading socio-economic losses. Financial markets can amplify such losses and generate systemic cross-sectoral effects, e.g. food insecurity. Our methodology links the real economy and financial markets to quantify cascading impacts across sectors and regions and to capture amplification effects by financial markets. Although applicable to any shock on global key commodity trade, we test its effectiveness with the Russia-Ukraine war, which reveals pronounced, regionally and sectorally diverse impacts. Comparing with real data confirms that our approach captures several key impacts of the crisis: the energy price increase in Europe, the strong reaction of European commodity future markets with large benefits for fossil companies (equity values up to +54%) and losses for companies most exposed to the belligerents (up to−6%), and the worsening of food affordability especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America (additionally 10 million people at risk of hunger). Our analysis shows the importance of accounting for cascading risks and amplification effects to strengthen economic, financial, and food system resilience. The Russia-Ukraine war worsened food affordability, increased energy prices in Europe, benefited fossil fuel producers, and led to economic losses for companies exposed to countries at war, according to a simulation of the financial valuation model and food affordability analysis."

 The growth and development of marine plants are largely dependent on nutrient input and solar radiation. Aerosols, through atmospheric deposition, can directly or indirectly influence the growth and distribution of marine organisms, while changes in cloud cover and aerosol presence can alter solar radiation levels. Gaining insight into aerosol-cloud interactions in the Northwest Pacific and their effects on marine plants can support the sustainable development and utilization of ocean resources. This study utilized aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from MODIS to examine the spatiotemporal distribution and potential sources of aerosols over the Northwest Pacific. Additionally, the study integrated MODIS data on cloud optical thickness of ice and liquid (COTI/COTL), cloud water path of ice and liquid (CWPI/CWPL), effective particle radii of ice and liquid clouds (CERI/CERL) and ocean net primary productivity (NPP) data from Oregon State University to analyze aerosol-cloud interaction patterns and their effects on marine phytoplankton. The results show that in the fishing grounds of the northwest Pacific (38°-46°N, 150°-175°E), the sustained northward migration and intensification of the subtropical high during summer weaken the upper-level atmosphere from Asia. This results in aerosols in the local marine area predominantly originating from the clean marine (CM) aerosols of the Pacific region, which typically peak from June to August each year (0.9). Aerosols in both the fishing and spawning grounds (20°-30°N, 130°-170°E) significantly affect the CWPI and CWPL, with those in the fishing grounds exerting a stronger influence. Furthermore, as the net primary productivity (NPP) in the fishing grounds is primarily influenced by clouds, aerosols indirectly impact local phytoplankton photosynthesis by suppressing cloud formation. In contrast, in the spawning grounds, the proximity to the East Asian continent leads to greater influence from human activities, with aerosol deposition and river inputs playing a dominant role in the local marine environment."

 The radiative perturbation of the Earth's energy balance caused by all aerosols, the direct radiative effect (DRE), and anthropogenic aerosols, the direct radiative forcing (DRF), remain major sources of uncertainty in climate projections. Here we propose a method for determining DRE and DRF that makes use of the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL)-retrieved aerosol loading and derived aerosol types (i.e. dust, marine, urban, smoke, etc.) in combination with aerosol-type specific optical properties. As the global spatiotemporal distributions of HSRL-derived aerosol types are not currently available, the methodology is tested here using a global 3-D model of atmospheric chemistry (GEOS-Chem) along with Creating Aerosols from CHemistry (CATCH) algorithm-generated aerosol types analogous to ones derived by HSRL. In this method, the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) is used to perform radiative transfer calculations with the single scattering albedo (SSA) and asymmetry parameter (g) of atmospheric particles assigned based on the aerosol type in each grid box. Average GEOS-Chem/CATCH-derived all-sky DRE and DRF across the North American domain are estimated to be −1.98 W/m2 and − 0.77 W/m2, respectively between mid-January and early February 2013 and − 4.20 W/m2 and − 1.41 W/m2 respectively between mid-July and early August 2014. Sensitivity studies revealed that the scheme may produce up to about ±0.42 W/m2 and ± 0.21 W/m2 uncertainty in DRE and DRF, respectively, related to variability in aerosol type-specific optical properties. This study presents a new way of determining DRE and DRF estimates once global retrievals of aerosol intensive parameters by HSRL become available."

 The impacts of terrain and urban surfaces on regional hourly extreme precipitation events (RHEPE) in Henan Province of China under specific synoptic conditions remain unclear. In this study, we first identify the dominant synoptic patterns associated with the summer RHEPEs in Henan and surrounding areas by employing spectral clustering methods, revealing that 86 % of RHEPEs are induced by the low vortexes and 14 % by the tropical cyclones, with the latter contributing to the most extreme RHEPEs. Then, based on numerical experiments and moisture budget decomposition, we quantify the effects of terrain and urban surfaces on RHEPE under the most extreme synoptic pattern featured by tropical cyclones. Results suggest that the terrains cause remarkable increases in precipitation primarily along the windward slopes of the Funiu Mountains and Taihang Mountains by 34 % and 26 %, respectively, this can be explained by the enhanced dynamical component of moisture convergence due to the blocking effect of terrains. Compared to the terrain, the impacts of urban surfaces are much smaller (only 1 %) and spatially limited. The much larger surface roughness in the urban areas reduces the horizontal wind speed and causes weakened wind convergence, leading to decreased precipitation over the urban areas. Meanwhile, when traversing the urban areas, the horizontal winds bifurcating and rejoining in the downwind areas increase the low-level convergence and precipitation there. Findings of this study may deepen our understanding of the influences of terrain and urban surfaces on the RHEPE and associated mechanisms under the extreme synoptic pattern."
