10.1088/1748-9326/ad7617,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了全球变暖背景下复合高温干旱（CHD）和复合高温湿润（CHW）极端事件的变化趋势和驱动因素。研究利用观测数据和气候模型模拟，发现两种复合极端事件的发生频率都显著增加，其中CHW的增加速率更高。研究还发现，人为气候变化是两种复合极端事件增加的主要驱动因素，尤其是对于CHW。而陆气相互作用对全球范围内的CHW影响有限，但对CHD的增加有显著贡献，通过加强降水与温度之间的负耦合关系，在某些地区甚至超过了人为气候变化的影响。理解这些变化和潜在原因对于提高复合极端事件的预测精度和减轻其影响至关重要。,"['temperature', 'precipitation', 'climate change', 'satellite observations', 'climate models']",Jianxin Zeng;Shulei Zhang;Sha Zhou;Omarjan Obulkasim;Han Zhang;Xingjie Lu;Yongjiu Dai,Comparison of the risks and drivers of compound hot-dry and hot-wet extremes in a warming world,"Compound hot-dry (CHD) and compound hot-wet (CHW) extremes have both intensified under global warming, posing exacerbated socio-economic threats compared to univariate extremes. This study presents a comprehensive assessment and comparison of the historical changes and driving factors behind CHD and CHW using observational data and climate model simulations. Findings indicate a notable surge in CHD and CHW occurrences, with CHW experiencing a higher increasing rate. Our investigation further reveals that anthropogenic climate change predominantly drives the increase in both types of compound extremes, especially for CHW. In contrast, land-atmosphere feedbacks have a limited impact on CHW at a global scale, but substantially contributes to the rise in CHD by reinforcing the negative precipitation-temperature coupling. This influence even surpasses that of anthropogenic climate change in specific regions. Understanding these variations and underlying causes is crucial for improving prediction accuracy and mitigating the impacts of compound extremes."

Yet, the threat of climate change—such as rising ocean temperatures—on mariculture performance remains uncertain. This is particularly true at small spatial scales relevant to most producers. Additionally, mariculture is often limited by regulations that impose restrictions on production, creating potential hurdles for anticipating and adapting to climate change. We focus on mariculture performance in the United States (U.S.), where state and federal policies and exposure to climate change vary substantially and likely interact. We map a current and future mariculture performance index by combining the first high resolution downscaled (0.083°) climate outputs for U.S. waters, species-specific physiological requirements, and policy restrictions. We find high current performance that will increase under warming oceans, with spatial variation that will amplify existing regional differences. Generally, performance will increase in the north and decrease in the south. While the permitting process is not intentionally climate-forward, permitted species outperformed taxon averages, yet state policies often limit production of seaweeds and finfishes, which perform well. Thus, we sit at a critical juncture where the U.S. could capitalize on its seemingly favorable environmental conditions through re-alignment of regulations to support portfolio diversification to include climate-resilient species."

We evaluated a landscape-scale (225 km2) decadal forest carbon budget at a 1 ha spatial resolution in a cool-temperate forest, by repeating airborne laser observations 10 years apart and partitioning net forest biomass change (FBC) into growth and mortality. Using >10 000 samples, we revealed that naturally regenerated forests have large spatial heterogeneity in net biomass change, and 3/4 of the photosynthetically acquired carbon stock moved to necromass even without anthropogenic disturbances. Actual carbon residence time as living tree biomass was estimated by dividing biomass by growth or mortality rates. The residence time was 107 and 106 years, respectively with large spatial variation among stands (48 and 42 years, respectively, as the difference between 25 and 75 percentile), although studied forest stands have small variation in the forest functional type in a landscape-scale. The best predictors of subsequent decadal biomass changes were two forest structural factors, mean canopy height and canopy height variation in addition to one environmental factor, elevation. Considering the long lifetime of trees, these structural factors may be an indicator of forest soundness rather than a cause of forest growth or mortality. However, in any cases, these structural factors can be powerful predictors of subsequent FBC."

This is largely because higher spatial resolution studies on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in China have focused mainly on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. This study uses a spatially detailed integrated energy-economy-climate model to evaluate DACCS for 31 provinces in China as the country pursues its goal of climate neutrality by 2060. We find that DACCS could expand China’s negative emissions capacity, particularly under sustainability-minded limits on bioenergy supply that are informed by bottom-up studies. But providing low-carbon electricity for multiple GtCO2 yr−1 DACCS may require over 600 GW of additional wind and solar capacity nationwide and comprise up to 30% of electricity demand in China’s northern provinces. Investment requirements for DACCS range from $330 to $530 billion by 2060 but could be repaid manyfold in the form of avoided mitigation costs, which DACCS deployment could reduce by up to $6 trillion over the same period. Enhanced efforts to lower residual CO2 emissions that must be offset with CDR under a net-zero paradigm reduce but do not eliminate the use of DACCS for mitigation. For decision-makers and the energy-economy models guiding them, our results highlight the value of expanding beyond the current reliance on biomass for negative emissions in China."

Among different resilience strategies, migration could be effective for nomadic societies despite the potential consequences of conflicts and epidemics. Thus, this study utilizes historical records to statistically investigate the linkages among nomadic migrations, nomad–farmer conflicts, and epidemics under climate change and population pressure in imperial China (200 BCE–1840 CE) on the national and provincial scales. The current study will first attempt to empirically identify and analyze the cost of resilience to climate change mainly in the direction from nomadic societies to agrarian societies in historical China. In particular, we show the cost of nomadic migration passed in a chain mechanism as ‘climate change → nomadic migration → nomad–farmer conflicts → epidemics.’ Nomad–farmer conflicts were one direct effect of nomadic migration, while epidemics were an indirect one. Spatially, more provinces were affected under the direct effect than under the indirect effect. Furthermore, the first level of chain ‘nomadic migration → nomad–farmer conflicts’ covers more provinces than the second level ‘nomad–farmer conflicts → epidemics’. These empirical results remind us to identify and avoid the cost of resilience as early as possible before the cost may transmit further in a chain manner. However, the provinces outside the concentrated nomad–farmer conflicts did not demonstrate significant linkages between conflicts and epidemics, which highlights the importance of peaceful cross-civilizational and inter-societal interactions against common challenges of climate change. This study with a cross-scale perspective in geography provides a theoretical implication to improve the current understanding on climate justice and have a practical value to avoid or minimize the cost of resilience."

Ironically, both these are direct fallouts of human activities such as indiscriminate consumption of consumer products/services and burning of fossil fuels. Purchase of consumer goods in 2024 is projected to be in excess of $22.6 trillion worldwide. How these consumers buy, use or dispose consumer goods will profoundly impact all life on the planet. Therefore, it is an imperative to embed sustainability in every Rupee of consumer spending. Hence a robust digital solution, CarbonShunya, has been developed with the purpose to empower a billion consumers to make sustainable purchase and lifestyle choices. CarbonShunya is India’s 1st solution that can measure and mitigate the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) footprint of consumer transactions in real-time. It provides consumers with actionable insights at the point-of-purchase and post-purchase to shape a shift in consumer beliefs, attitudes and behavior. This paper presents the methodology, assumptions and processes which have been adopted to develop the CarbonShunya life-cycle assessment framework and solution in Indian context. It also presents a case study, using the CarbonShunya framework, to measure and mitigate GHG impacts of monthly consumer expenditure on several categories of products/services across various states of India, based on a primary survey of over 174 000 households. The results from the case-study provide actionable insights and conclusions for policymakers and practitioners. CarbonShunya has cross-cutting applications across sectors so as to enable consuming economies to embrace conserving behaviors."

Yet we have a limited understanding of how collaborative environmental governance mobilizes different types of social capital and how the advantages and costs of social capital accrue for different groups of people. Explicit measures of social capital, such as through social network methods, will help build an understanding of how social capital facilitates collective processes and for whom. We reviewed highly cited articles in Web of Science and Scopus using ‘social capital’ as the search term to identify foundational and emergent social capital concepts. In the context of collaborative environmental governance, we operationalized these social capital concepts with network measures drawn from our expertise and highlighted existing empirical relationships between such network measures and collaborative outcomes. We identified two different perspectives on social capital—one based on social relations that could be readily operationalized with social network measures and the other based on actor characteristics that can further contextualize network data. Relational social capital concepts included social relations among actors; the collective social setting in which relations are embedded; and the advantages and costs that social capital confers to individuals and the collective. Social capital concepts based on actor characteristics included socio-cognitions (e.g. trust, norms, identification with a group, shared meanings) and community engagement (e.g. group membership, civic participation, volunteerism). Empirical evidence using social network approaches to measure social capital reveals patterns in relationship building that influence collaborative and other sustainability outcomes. Social network approaches described here may help define and quantify the social capital mobilized by collaborative governance. Additional research is necessary to track the social capital of collaboratives over time, link it to outcomes, and better understand the social justice implications of collaborative governance."

Meijer,Interannual variations in the Δ(17O) signature of atmospheric CO2 at two mid-latitude sites suggest a close link to stratosphere–troposphere exchange,"We present records of the triple oxygen isotope signature (Δ(17O)) of atmospheric CO2 obtained with laser absorption spectroscopy from two mid-latitude stations. Significant interannual variability is observed in both records. A model sensitivity study suggests that stratosphere–troposphere exchange, which carries high-Δ(17O) CO2 from the stratosphere into the troposphere, causes most of the variability. This makes Δ(17O) a potential tracer for stratospheric intrusions into the troposphere. 
 Δ(17O) measurements of atmospheric CO2 have the potential to be a tracer for gross primary production and stratosphere–troposphere mixing. A positive Δ(17O) originates from intrusions of stratospheric CO2, whereas values close to −0.21 ‰ result from the equilibration of CO2 and water, which predominantly happens inside plants. The stratospheric source of CO2 with high Δ(17O) is, however, not well defined in the current models. More, and long-term, atmospheric measurements are needed to improve this. We present records of the Δ(17O) of atmospheric CO2 obtained with laser absorption spectroscopy from Lutjewad in the Netherlands (53°24′ N, 6°21′ E) and Mace Head in Ireland (53°20′ N, 9°54′ W) that cover the period 2017–2022. The records are compared with a 3-D model simulation, and we study potential model improvements. Both records show significant interannual variability of up to 0.3 ‰. The total range covered by smoothed monthly averages from the Lutjewad record is −0.34 ‰ to −0.12 ‰, which is significantly higher than the range of −0.20 ‰ to −0.17 ‰ for the model simulation. The 100 hPa 60–90° N monthly-mean temperature anomaly was used as a proxy to scale stratospheric downwelling in the model. This strongly improves the correlation coefficient of the simulated and observed year-to-year Δ(17O) variations over the period 2019–2021 from 0.40 to 0.82. As the Δ(17O) of atmospheric CO2 seems to be dominated by stratospheric influx, its use as a tracer for stratosphere–troposphere exchange should be further investigated."

This study provides measurements of TBs from various biomass-burning events and ages, enhancing our knowledge of TB emissions and our understanding of their climate impact. 
 Biomass burning emits large numbers of organic aerosol particles, a subset of which are called tarballs (TBs). TBs possess a spherical morphology and unique physical, chemical, and optical properties. They are recognized as brown-carbon aerosol particles, influencing the climate through the absorption of solar radiation. Aerosol particles were collected from wildfire and agricultural-fire smoke sampled by NASA's DC-8 aircraft during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) campaign in the western US from July to September 2019. This study developed an image analysis method using deep learning to distinguish TBs from other round particles that deformed on the substrate, based on the particles' morphological characteristics in transmission electron microscopy images. This study detected 4567 TBs, with most occurring < 10 h downwind of the emissions, and measured their compositions, abundance, sizes, and mixing states. The number fraction, mass fraction, and concentration of TBs in wildfire smoke corresponded to 10 ± 1 %, 10 ± 2 %, and 10.1 ± 4.6 µg m−3, respectively. As the smoke aged for up to 5 h after emission, the TB number fractions roughly increased from 5 % to 15 %, indicating that TBs are processed primary particles. We also observed TBs associated with pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) activity and various TB mixing states. This study reveals the abundance, as well as the physical and chemical properties, of a wide range of TBs from various biomass-burning events and enhances our knowledge of TB emissions, contributing to the evaluation of the climate impact of TBs."

The ATC test was the most effective, achieving 72.98 % accuracy during daytime and 59.50 % at night, making it suitable for creating a high-level cloud mask. 
 All clouds influence the Earth's radiative budget, with their net radiative forcing being negative. However, high-level clouds warrant special attention due to their atmospheric warming effects. A comprehensive characterization of cirrus requires information on cloud coverage, obtainable from various data types. Active satellite sensors are presently the most accurate source for cirrus data, but their usefulness in climatological studies is limited. On the contrary, passive data, available for the past 40 years with sufficient temporal resolution for climatological research, were not specifically designed for cirrus detection. In this study, we assessed the utility of MODIS standard products for creating a cirrus mask by validating them against CALIOP data. Our objective was to determine if a MODIS product exists that detects cirrus with the same accuracy as CALIOP."

We developed the U-Surf data, a 1km-resolution dataset that provides key urban surface properties worldwide. U-Surf enhances urban representation in models, enables city-to-city comparison, and supports kilometer-scale Earth system modeling. Its broader applications can be extended to machine learning and many other non-climatic practices. 
 High-resolution urban climate modeling has faced substantial challenges due to the absence of a globally consistent, spatially continuous, and accurate dataset to represent the spatial heterogeneity of urban surfaces and their biophysical properties. This deficiency has long obstructed the development of urban-resolving Earth System Models (ESMs) and ultra-high-resolution urban climate modeling, particularly at large scales. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind 1km-resolution present-day (circa-2020) global continuous urban surface parameter dataset – U-Surf. Using the urban canopy model (UCM) in the Community Earth System Model as a base model for developing dataset requirements, U-Surf leverages the latest advances in remote sensing, machine learning, and cloud computing to provide the most relevant urban surface biophysical parameters, including radiative, morphological, and thermal properties, for UCMs at the facet- and canopy-level. Our high-resolution U-Surf dataset significantly improves the representation of the urban land heterogeneity both within and across cities globally. U-Surf provides essential, high-fidelity surface biophysical constraints to urban-resolving ESMs, enables detailed city-to-city comparisons across the globe, and supports the next-generation kilometer-resolution Earth system modeling across scales. U-Surf parameters can be easily converted or adapted to various types of UCMs, such as those embedded in weather and regional climate models, as well as air quality models. The fundamental urban surface constraints provided by U-Surf are also relevant as features for machine learning models and can have other broad-scale applications for socioeconomic, public health, and urban planning contexts. We expect U-Surf to promote the research frontier on urban systems science, climate-sensitive urban design, and coupled human-Earth systems in the future.

 We introduce the optimized dynamic mode decomposition algorithm for constructing an adaptive and computationally efficient reduced order model and forecasting tool for global atmospheric chemistry dynamics. By exploiting a low-dimensional set of global spatio-temporal modes, interpretable characterizations of the underlying spatial and temporal scales can be computed. Forecasting is also achieved with a linear model that uses a linear superposition of the dominant spatio-temporal features. The DMD method is demonstrated on three months of global chemistry dynamics data, showing its significant performance in computational speed and interpretability. We show that the presented decomposition method successfully extracts known major features of atmospheric chemistry, such as summertime surface pollution and biomass burning activities. Moreover, the DMD algorithm allows for rapid reconstruction of the underlying linear model, which can then easily accommodate non-stationary data and changes in the dynamics."

The contaminated paddy soil predominantly consisted of particles measuring <53, 250–53, and 2000–250 μm, with the <53 μm fractions exhibiting the highest concentrations of multiple metals. Interestingly, despite their higher overall content, the <53 μm fractions released less dissolved metal. Furthermore, glucose enhanced the release of arsenic while simultaneously promoting the sequestration of other metals, such as Pb, Zn, and Cu. Utilizing asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation, we unveiled the presence of both fine (0.3–130 kDa) and large (130–450 nm) colloidal pools, each carrying various metals with different affinities for iron minerals and organic matter. Our results highlighted the pivotal role of the <53 μm fraction as a significant reservoir for multiple metal contaminants in paddy soils, in which the colloidal metals were mainly associated with organic matter. These findings illuminated the size-resolved dynamics of soil metal cycling and provided insights for developing remediation strategies for metal-contaminated soil ecosystems."

The efficient degradation of sulfonylurea herbicides is critical. SulE, an esterase isolated from the bacterial strain Hansschlegelia zhihuaiae S113, shows degradation activity toward sulfonylurea herbicides. However, the detailed catalytic mechanism remains vague to a large extent. Herein, we decipher the SulEP44R-catalyzed degradation mechanism of sulfonylurea herbicides using hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics approaches. Our results show that the degradation of sulfonylureas catalyzed by SulEP44R involves four concerted elementary steps. The rate-determining step has an energy barrier range of 19.7–21.4 kcal·mol–1, consistent with the experimentally determined range of 16.0–18.0 kcal·mol–1. Distortion/interaction analysis demonstrates that active-site amino acids play a vital role in the enzymatic catalytic efficacy. The unique architecture of SulEP44R’s active site can serve as an excellent template for designing artificial catalysts. Key structural and charge parameters affecting catalytic activity were systematically screened and identified. Based on the elucidated degradation mechanism, several new herbicides with both high herbicidal activity and biodegradability were developed with the aid of a high-throughput strategy. Our findings may advance the application of sulfonylurea herbicides within the framework of environmental sustainability."

However, spatial separation of renewables and water resources as well as water scarcity per capita in China necessitate unconventional water resources for electrolysis. Reclaimed water produced from municipal wastewater treatment plants is widely distributed with quality improved significantly in recent years, which may be a promising alternative to feedstock. However, there are few reports on the direct use of this wastewater for H2 production. Here, we present a direct electrolysis of reclaimed water for decentralized H2 production by developing a highly efficient and stable bifunctional 3D-dandelion-like (DL) vanadium(V)-doped CoP catalyst grown in situ on Ni foam (NF) in an alkaline electrolyzer. The V-CoP-DL/NF electrode decreases 6.5 and 25% overpotentials of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, compared to noble-metal Pt (HER) and IrO2 (OER) catalysts, and exhibits exceptional durability, as a voltage required for overall reclaimed water splitting only increases by 80 mV (1.81–1.89 V) after 90 days of operation at a current density of 10 mA cm–2. The maximum stable current can reach 1000 mA cm–2. The impacts of potential pollutants in reclaimed water on the performance of electrolysis and the behavior of major wastewater ions in alkaline electrolyte were investigated. The observed exceptional performance is attributed to the catalyst’s unique nanostructure, which enhances charge transfer and reactant/electrolyte diffusion. The in situ growth strategy further enhances the conductivity and stability of the catalyst. This work underscores the feasibility of utilizing reclaimed water instead of pure water as the feedstock for sustainable hydrogen production."

In this study, size distribution and elemental composition of individual MNPs from various coal fly ashes (CFAs) collected from a representative coal-fired power plant were analyzed using a single-particle inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry technique. Majority (61–80%) of MNPs were identified as multimetal (mm)-MNPs, while the contribution of single metal (sm)-MNPs to the total increased throughout all the CFAs, reaching the highest in fly ash escaped through the stack (EFA). Among Fe-rich MNPs, Fe-sole and Fe–Al matrices were predominant, and Fe-sole MNPs were identified as the important carrier for toxic metals, with the highest mass contributions of toxic metals therein. Toxic potency results showed that the oxidative stress induced by MNPs was 1.2–2.2 times greater than those of <1 μm fractions in CFAs, while the reduction in cell viability showed no significant difference, elucidating that these MNPs can induce more distinct oxidative stress compared to cell toxicity. Based on structural equation model, MNP size can both directly and indirectly regulate the toxic potency, and the indirect regulation is through a size-dependent elemental composition of MNPs, including toxic metals. sm-MNPs and Fe-rich MNPs with Fe-sole, Fe–Cr, and Fe–Zn matrices can regulate the oxidative stress, whereas Cr, Zn, and Pb associated with Fe-sole, Fe–Al, Si–Fe, and Al–Fe MNPs showed significant effects on cell viability."

However, whether anammox bacteria can grow under aerobic conditions remains unclear. In this study, we found that the production of nitrate in the anammox system under aerobic conditions was significantly higher than that under anaerobic conditions without total nitrogen loss. Anammox bacteria can grow by oxidizing nitrite and dehydrogenating hydrazine to produce electrons for carbon fixation. The hydrazine dehydrogenase in anammox bacteria was inhibited under aerobic conditions, and the nitrite oxidoreductase transcription expression of anammox bacteria increased by 2.7 times compared to that under anaerobic conditions, which was the main way for anammox bacteria perform carbon fixation. DNA-stable isotope probing with 13C bicarbonate found the existence of anammox bacteria with 13C isotopes in aerobic cultivation, further proving that anammox bacteria can grow under aerobic condition. More than half of the pathways in glycolysis, the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were upregulated in anammox bacteria in aerobic condition. Large amounts of bacterioferritins are the important antioxidative enzymes in anammox bacteria in the aerobic environment, which contributes to their stronger oxygen adaptation than other anaerobes.

Despite the numerous absorbents developed for SLCs removal, the underlying interaction mechanisms remain speculative and lack experimental validation. To address this research gap, we elucidate the mechanistic insights into the selective removal of SLCs using mesoporous polydopamine nanospheres (MPDA) fabricated via a novel soft-template method. We employed low-field nuclear magnetic resonance to quantitatively characterize the hydrophilicity of the absorbents using water molecules as probes. The results demonstrated that MPDA with uniform mesopores exhibited a remarkable threefold enhancement in SLCs’ adsorption capacity compared to conventional polydopamine particles via intraparticle diffusion. We further demonstrated the dominant effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on the selective removal of SLCs with MPDA by regulating the isoelectric pH value and performing a comparative analysis. The mechanism-inspired SLC-removal strategy achieved an average removal rate of 76.3% from highly contaminated wastewater. Our findings offer new avenues for applying MPDA as an efficient adsorbent and provide innovative and mechanistic insights for targeted SLC removal in complex wastewater matrices."

In the environment, PAHs are highly complex in chemical composition, and a great variety of PAHs tend to co-occur. Despite extensive investigation on the photochemical behavior of individual PAH molecules, the photochemical interaction among these coexisting PAHs is still not well understood. Here, we show that during photooxidation, there is a strong photochemical synergistic effect among PAHs extracted from soot particles. We find that neither small PAHs with low molecular weights of 200–350 Da and 4–8 aromatic rings (named PAHsmall) nor large PAHs with high molecular weights of 350–600 Da and 8–14 aromatic rings (named PAHlarge) undergo photooxidation under red-light irradiation (λ = 648 nm), even though PAHlarge can absorb light with this wavelength. Interestingly, when PAHlarge is mixed with PAHsmall, substantial photooxidation is observed for both PAHlarge and PAHsmall. Comparisons of in situ infrared (IR), high-resolution mass spectrometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis indicate that the presence of PAHsmall inhibits the light quenching effect arising from the π–π stacking of PAHlarge. This leads to the formation of singlet oxygen (1O2), which initiates the photooxidation. Our findings reveal a new mechanism for the photooxidation of PAHs and suggest that complex atmospheric PAHs exhibit distinct photoreactivity from simple systems."

The greenhouse gases‐induced sea surface warming amplifies the sensitivity of evaporation to surface wind speed changes through Clausius‐Clapeyron scaling, leading to an interhemispheric asymmetric enhancement of the latent heat flux. To maintain hemispheric energy balance, the cross‐equatorial atmospheric energy transport must be reduced during the solstice seasons.

Microscopy and chemical analyses of atmospherically deposited particles on snow surfaces at high elevation (2,865–3,690 m) in the Upper Colorado River basin (UCRB; Colorado Rocky Mountains) revealed the presence of black substances intimately associated with microplastic fibers, particles interpreted to have originated as tire matter. Identical and similar particles occur in shredded tires and road‐surface samples. The substance responsible for the black color of all tires is carbon black, a graphitic light‐absorbing tire additive produced by hydrocarbon combustion that homogeneously permeates the mixture of tire polymers and other additives. Such black tire matter may thus exert radiative effects closely similar to those of black carbon. The presence in snow of many organic compound types common to tires, measured by two‐dimensional gas chromatography, suggests that atmospherically deposited black road‐tire‐wear matter is among the light‐absorbing particulates that advance the onset and rate of snow melt in the UCRB. The mass of road‐tire‐wear particles shed from vehicles may be estimated by multiplying measured amounts of eroded tire‐per‐distance traveled by vehicular distances.

In this time‐series study, we assessed the association between heatwaves and outpatient visits for mental disorders in Guangzhou, China. Daily outpatient visits for mental disorders and its specific categories (schizophrenia, mood, and neurotic disorders) were sourced from the Urban Resident‐based Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) and the Urban Employee‐based Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) claims databases in Guangzhou from 2010 to 2014. The study employed nine heatwave definitions, based on combinations of three daily mean temperature thresholds (90th, 92.5th, and 95th percentiles) and durations (2, 3, and 4 days). Using quasi‐Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs), we estimated the risks (at lag 0 day) and cumulative effects (lag 0–10 days) of heatwaves on mental disorder outpatient visits. Age, gender, types of medical insurance were considered as potential effect modifiers. We observed a positive association between heatwaves and increased total outpatient visits for mental disorders, both at lag 0 day and during lag 0–10 days. The impact of heatwave was significant at lag 0 day for schizophrenia, mood and neurotic disorders visits, it remained significant for neurotic and mood disorders visits during lag 0–10 days. Heatwave durations lasting more than 4 days were associated with higher relative risks of mental disorders at lag 0 day. Older adults had relatively higher effect estimations than younger individuals. This research highlights the effects of extreme heat on mental health."

 Back contact silicon solar cells, valued for their aesthetic appeal by removing grid lines on the sunny side, find applications in buildings, vehicles and aircrafts, enabling self-power generation without compromising appearance1-3. Patterning techniques arrange contacts on the shaded side of the silicon wafer, offering benefits for light incidence as well. However, the patterning process complicates production and causes power loss. Here we employ lasers to streamline back contact solar cell fabrication and enhance power conversion efficiency. Our approach produces the first silicon solar cell to exceed 27% efficiency. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers are deposited on the wafer for surface passivation and collection of light-generated carriers. A dense passivating contact, diverging from conventional technology practice, is developed. Pulsed picosecond lasers at different wavelengths are used to create back contact patterns. The developed approach is a streamlined process for producing high-performance back contact silicon solar cells, with a total effective processing time of about one-third that of emerging mainstream technology. To meet terawatt demand, we develop rare indium-less cells at 26.5% efficiency and precious silver-free cells at 26.2% efficiency.

 Oil-in-water emulsion is a system with extensive applications in foods, cosmetics and coating industries, and it could also be designed into an artificial lipid droplet in recent works. However, the insights into the biophysical dynamic behaviors of such artificial lipid droplets are lacking. Here, we reveal an enzymatic reaction triggered endocytosis-like behavior in the oil-in-water emulsion lipid droplets. A thermodynamically favored recruitment of lipases onto the membrane of the droplets is demonstrated. We confirm that the hydrolysis of tributyrin by lipases can decrease the interfacial tension and increase the compressive force on the membrane, which are the two main driving forces for triggering the endocytosis-like behavior. The endocytosis-like behavior induced various emerging functionalities of the lipid droplets, including proteins, DNA or inorganic particles being efficiently sequestered into the oil droplet with reversible release as well as enhanced cascade enzymatic reaction. Overall, our studies are expected to open up a way to functionalize oil-in-water emulsions capable of life-inspired behaviors and tackle emerging challenges in bottom-up synthetic biology, revealing the unknown dynamic behaviors of lipid droplets in living organisms.

 Wearable thermoelectric generators provide a reliable power generation method for self-powered wearable electronic devices. However, there has been a lack of research regarding the comfort of wearable thermoelectric generators. Here we propose a design for a comfortable wearable thermoelectric generators system with high output power based on sandwiched thermoelectric model. This model paves the way for simultaneously optimizing comfort (skin temperature and pressure perception) and output power by systematically considering a variety of thermal resistive environments and bending states, the properties of the thermoelectric and encapsulation materials, and the device structure. To verify this strategy, we fabricate wearable thermoelectric generators using Mg-based thermoelectric materials. These materials have great potential for replacing traditional Bi2Te3-based materials and enable our wearable thermoelectric generators with a power density of 18.4 μWcm−2 under a wearing pressure of 0.8 kPa and with a skin temperature of 33 °C, ensuring the wearer’s comfort.

Here, the authors demonstrate that CHIP mediates non-degradative ubiquitination of STX17, which enhances SNRAE complex formation, which alleviates NAFLD. 
 The fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes is essential for the prevention of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we generate a hepatocyte-specific CHIP knockout (H-KO) mouse model that develops NAFLD more rapidly in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) or high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD). The accumulation of P62 and LC3 in the livers of H-KO mice and CHIP-depleted cells indicates the inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. AAV8-mediated overexpression of CHIP in the murine liver slows the progression of NAFLD induced by HFD or HFHFD feeding. Mechanistically, CHIP induced K63- and K27-linked polyubiquitination at the lysine 198 residue of STX17, resulting in increased STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 complex formation. The STX17 K198R mutant was not ubiquitinated by CHIP; it interfered with its interaction with VAMP8, rendering STX17 incapable of inhibiting steatosis development in mice. These results indicate that a signaling regulatory mechanism involving CHIP-mediated non-degradative ubiquitination of STX17 is necessary for autophagosome-lysosome fusion.

Here, the authors develop cost-effective and accurate plasmonic biosensor platform which detects pyrin-protein levels to aid diagnosis of FMF. 
 Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, primarily observed in populations around the Mediterranean Sea, linked to MEFV gene mutations. These mutations disrupt inflammatory responses, increasing pyrin-protein production. Traditional diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms, family history, acute phase reactants, and excluding similar syndromes with MEFV testing, which is expensive and often inconclusive due to heterozygous mutations. Here, we present a biosensor platform that detects differences in pyrin-protein levels between healthy and affected individuals, offering a cost-effective alternative to genetic testing. Our platform uses gold nanoparticle-based plasmonic chips enhanced with anti-pyrin antibodies, achieving a detection limit of 0.24 ng/mL with high specificity. The system integrates an optofluidic system and visible light spectroscopy for real-time analysis, with signal stability maintained for up to six months. Our technology will enhance FMF diagnosis accuracy, enabling early treatment initiation and providing a cost-effective alternative to genetic testing, thus improving patient care.

 Evolutionarily relevant networks have been previously described in several mammalian species using time-averaged analyses of fMRI time-series. However, fMRI network activity is highly dynamic and continually evolves over timescales of seconds. Whether the dynamic organization of resting-state fMRI network activity is conserved across mammalian species remains unclear. Using frame-wise clustering of fMRI time-series, we find that intrinsic fMRI network dynamics in awake male macaques and humans is characterized by recurrent transitions between a set of 4 dominant, neuroanatomically homologous fMRI coactivation modes (C-modes), three of which are also plausibly represented in the male rodent brain. Importantly, in all species C-modes exhibit species-invariant dynamic features, including preferred occurrence at specific phases of fMRI global signal fluctuations, and a state transition structure compatible with infraslow coupled oscillator dynamics. Moreover, dominant C-mode occurrence reconstitutes the static organization of the fMRI connectome in all species, and is predictive of ranking of corresponding fMRI connectivity gradients.

 Atmospheric aerosols in megacities impact air quality and public health. However, limited information exists on the detailed molecular composition of organic aerosols in urban areas. This study characterized the molecular composition of organic aerosols (OA) in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, China, during summer and winter of 2021. Liquid chromatography-orbitrap mass spectrometry detected 4536−5560 and 2067− 3489 organic molecular formulas in positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI−) electrospray ionization modes, respectively. CHO and CHON compounds accounted for over 80% and 60% of total abundance in ESI+ and ESI−, respectively, suggesting their significant contribution to urban OA. The number and abundance percentages of CHO showed obvious seasonal variation, with more CHO in summer than in winter, while CHON exhibited the opposite trend in Beijing and Shanghai. Compared with winter, a lower unsaturation degree, reduced aromaticity, and higher oxidation state of OA in summer were observed in Beijing and Shanghai, while these seasonal variations were not as obvious in Guangzhou, likely due to regional climate differences. The number percentage of common compounds between Beijing and Shanghai was higher than that between Guangzhou and Beijing (or Shanghai). Nitroaromatic compounds were more prevalent in winter than in summer. Further analysis of atmospheric formation relevance and precursor-product pairs suggested that CHON compounds are derived from the oxidization or hydrolyzation processes, revealing potential chemical transformations of these aerosols.

 Atmospheric moisture transport is pivotal in regulating water resources over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). With the growing concerns about climate change, understanding the evolution of atmospheric moisture transport over the TP has become increasingly critical. however, the spatiotemporal distinctions of this transport remain poorly understood in the CMIP6 models. Here, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of simulated historical atmospheric moisture transport from 33 CMIP6 models, utilizing a novel methodology that assesses the accuracy of model simulations in replicating regional atmospheric moisture transport over the TP. Our results indicate that the CMIP6 models generally succeed in reproducing the broad spatial patterns of atmospheric moisture transport. Nonetheless, substantial errors occur during the monsoon period, primarily attributable to inaccuracies in the location, movement, and intensity of the simulated Indian summer monsoon. The coarser resolution and poor representation of physical processes are potential reasons for errors in atmospheric moisture transport simulation over the TP. The Failure to simulate the terrain blocking on atmospheric moisture transport exacerbates these deficiencies, leading to significant discrepancies. Of the 33 CMIP6 models we investigated, over one-third displayed serious deficiencies in this regard. While coarser resolution and orographic gravity waves are plausible factors, they do not fully account for all the results obtained in this study. Insufficiently detailed or inaccurate topographic data used in the models may also contribute to this deficiency. This study highlights the necessity of using rigorously evaluated models to develop effective regional adaptation strategies over the Tibetan Plateau."

 The presence of plastics and microplastics in water environments has raised concerns for potential negative impacts.

Here, we investigated the role of plastic as a substrate for biofilm growth and how this affects the dispersal of terrestrial microalgae, potentially altering the assembly of pelagic communities. When exposing an artificially assembled microalgae community to pristine and biofouled plastic under laboratory-controlled conditions, we found that only biofouled plastic affected the final community structure and the content of available nutrients in water. This is due to the exchanged algal species between the biofilm and the pelagic community. The results from this batchwise pilot scale study indicate that plastic can act as a substrate for benthic and pelagic species, potentially affecting ecosystem functions, which have been overlooked so far.

 The Millennium Eruption of Mt. Baekdu, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in the Common Era, initiated in late 946. It remains uncertain whether its two main compositional phases, rhyolite and trachyte, were expelled in a single eruption or in two. Investigations based on proximal and medial ash have not resolved this question, prompting us to turn to high-resolution ice-core evidence. Here, we report a suite of glaciochemical and tephra analyses of a Greenlandic ice core, identifying the transition from rhyolitic to trachytic tephra with corresponding spikes in insoluble particle fallout. By modeling annual snow accumulation, we estimate an interval of one to two months between these spikes, which approximates the hiatus between two eruptive phases. Additionally, negligible sulfur mass-independent fractionation, near-synchroneity between particle and sulfate deposition, and peak sulfur fallout in winter all indicate an ephemeral aerosol veil. These factors limited the climate forcing potential of the Millennium Eruption. The Millennium Eruption of Mt.

 The Tibetan Plateau glaciers, among the world’s most remote and pristine places, provide water to millions and play a vital environmental role. We measured the lead isotopic composition in a dusty ice core from the Guliya ice cap in northwest Tibet, from approximately 36 thousand years Before Present (Stone Age) to 2015, to determine the onset and sources of anthropogenic lead. Despite the dust-laden nature of the core, a clear change in the lead isotope signature to below Stone Age levels started in 1949 followed by a rapid decrease in 1960 and an even more rapid decrease in 1974 indicating the first emergence of anthropogenic lead. Accurate isotopic lead measurements allowed us to better, and more sensitively, quantify sources using a Bayesian mixing model. Chinese gasoline was the primary anthropogenic source surpassing natural contributions in the 2000s until 2007 when emissions from leaded gasoline decreased and those from coal and lead-zinc ores increased.

 The Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) provides a novel nighttime light (NTL) data product with medium spatial resolution, captured by its unique Glimmer Imager (GLI) sensor. Unlike traditional NTL products, the exceptional resolution of SDGSAT-1 NTL data allows for distinct visualization of urban road networks. Although recent studies have validated the effectiveness of SDGSAT-1 NTL data in supporting various sustainable development goals, their potential for urban road extraction has not yet been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we propose a novel terrain skeleton-based method for extracting urban main roads from SDGSAT-1 NTL images. This proposed method innovatively uses a terrain analogy, considering SDGSAT-1 NTL data as a continuous terrain surface and urban roads as terrain ridge lines to facilitate road extraction. To validate this approach, we selected nine cities with diverse sizes and complex road networks—six in China and three in the United States. Extensive experimental results showed that the proposed method effectively extracts urban roads with an average accuracy of 85.14 % using red-green-blue (RGB) bands and 83.99 % using panchromatic bands, outperforming previous methods, including the optimal threshold, line segment detector, watershed, and U-Net. The main road types extracted were residential, tertiary, secondary, and primary. Additionally, our findings indicated that SDGSAT-1 NTL data capture over 82 % of city road networks, significantly surpassing the coverage provided by the DMSP/OLS, NPP-VIIRS, and Luojia1–01 NTL data. Overall, this study confirms that the significant potential of SDGSAT-1 NTL data for urban main road extraction, offering valuable insights for improving infrastructure mapping and urban planning."

 Rapid and accurate assessment of building damage in sudden-onset disasters is crucial for effective humanitarian assistance and disaster response. However, the occurrence of disasters is highly uncertain, e.g., unexpected geographic location and hazards, which challenge the conventional building damage assessment model on generalization and transferability. Unfortunately, there is little public literature on transferable building damage assessment. This is because assessing building damage using pre- and post-disaster satellite images is a complex, multi-temporal, and multi-task problem. It involves two main subtasks: building localization and damage classification, which are non-trivial to handle with generic transfer learning approaches designed for single-image and single-task problems. On the other hand, post-disaster training image availability in the target domain remains an obstacle since these generic transfer learning methods require pre-/post-disaster image pairs as target training images, resulting in a costly time window (period from obtaining post-event training image to obtaining assessment results) in disaster response. In this paper, we present a single-temporal domain adaptive semantic change detection framework, which frames domain adaptive building damage assessment and only additionally requires target pre-disaster images for adaptation training. Our framework first presents a decoupled task modeling via the equivalent form of prediction error expectations. This enables generic transfer learning methods to be used for domain adaptive building damage assessment. To fundamentally overcome the problem of post-disaster training image availability within our framework, we propose an unsupervised single-temporal change adaptation (STCA) algorithm. The main idea is “damage is everywhere”, which is motivated by the fact that building damage is a change process driven by the disaster event. We leverage target pre-disaster images and source post-disaster images to simulate such semantic change processes to provide training data, fundamentally addressing the post-disaster training image availability issue and avoiding that costly time window. The extensive experiments on global-scale and local-scale study areas suggest that our framework allows most transfer learning approaches to work well on domain adaptive building damage assessment. Our STCA achieves superior performance compared to other transfer learning approaches. More importantly, unlike other approaches that rely on target pre/post-disaster images for adaptation, it requires no target post-disaster training images. This nature significantly improves the availability of STCA in real-world disaster response for the building damage assessment model."

 This work uses a mixture of observations from surface remote sensing (AERONET) and satellite remote sensing (OMI) to uniquely compute the atmospheric column loading of black carbon (BC) mass concentration density (MCD) and number concentration density (NCD) on a grid-by-grid, day-by-day basis at 0.25°x0.25° over rapidly developing and biomass burning (BB) impacted regions in South, Southeast, and East Asia. This mixture of observations is uniformly analyzed based on OMI NO2 retrievals, OMI Near ultraviolet band absorption aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo (SSA), and AERONET visible and near-infrared band SSA observations, in connection with an inversely applied MIE mixing model approach. This method uniquely solves for the unbiased spatial and temporal domains based on variance maximization of daily NO2. These locations in space and time are then used to quantify the distribution of all possible individual particle core and refractory shell sizes as constrained by all band-by-band observations of SSA from AERONET. Finally, the range of NCD and MCD are computed from the constrained range of per-particle core and refractory shell size on a grid-by-grid and day-by-day basis. The maps of MCD and NCD are consistent in space and time with known urban, industrial, and BB sources. The statistical distributions are found to be non-normal, with the region-wide mean, 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile MCD [mg/m2] of 90.3, 56.1, 81.1, and 111 respectively, and NCD [x1012 particles/m2] of 8.76, 4.63, 7.39, and 11.3 respectively. On a grid-by-grid basis, a significant amount of variation is found, particularly over Myanmar, Laos, northern Thailand, and Vietnam, with this subregional mean, 25th, 50th, and 75th MCD [mg/m2] of 90.7, 56.1, 81.3, and 112 respectively and NCD [x1012 particles/m2] of 9.66, 5.49, 8.33, and 12.3 respectively. On a day-to-day basis, events are determined 121 days in 2016, during which the computed statistics of MCD and NCD have mean and uncertainty ranges which scale with each other. However, there are 11 days where the uncertainty ratio of NCD values is larger than 1 while the uncertainty ratio of MCD is small, and 5 days where the reverse is observed, indicating that the particle size is strongly atypical on these days, consistent with mixed aerosol sources, a substantial change in the aerosol aging, or other such factors including a substantial region of overlap between BB and urban sources. The high values observed from March to May lead to an extended BB season as compared to previous work focusing on fire radiative power, NO2, and models, which show a shorter season (usually ending in early April). The results are consistent with BC being able to transport significant distances. The new approach is anticipated to provide support for improving radiative forcing calculations, estimating emissions inventories, and providing a basis by which models can compare against observations."

 :Distance and incidence angle effects play crucial roles in determining the raw intensity captured by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems. For these two effects, the emergence of hyperspectral LiDAR necessitates a deep theoretical exploration of potential coupling relationships and wavelength dependence. From a theoretical standpoint, this study provides a systematic demonstration, based on theoretical derivation, focusing on the independence of distance and incidence angle effects and their wavelength dependence, while considering the heterogeneity of natural targets. The key findings are as follows: (1) the distance effect, which is wavelength-independent, is determined by the distance and LiDAR system, characterized by the concept of a “distance effect function”. (2) The incidence angle effect is wavelength-dependent and arises from backscattering characteristic of the target, characterized by the biconical reflectance of the measured target. An accurate expression for this effect should be “incidence angle effect of the target under hyperspectral LiDAR conditions”, rather than the “incidence angle effect of hyperspectral LiDAR system”. (3) Intensity data are simultaneously affected by distance and incidence angle, but these effects are independent and can be individually corrected. (4) Once the distance effect function is obtained for a certain LiDAR system, it can be directly used to correct the distance effect at any time during scanning tasks. However, the incidence angle effect cannot be directly corrected; it requires additional measurements to acquire surface reflection characteristics of the target at various incidence angles. Additionally, this study reviews several basic physical concepts commonly adopted by the optical remote sensing community for modeling the backscattering and reflection processes between LiDAR signals and natural targets. A simplified laser radar equation for small-footprint hyperspectral LiDAR corroborated the classic finding by Kavaya, serving as a theoretical basis for reasoning and understanding the radiative effects. While tailored for hyperspectral LiDAR, the presented fundamental physical concepts and conclusions are also applicable to traditional small-footprint single-wavelength and multispectral LiDAR systems."

 Diffuse solar radiation (DR) constitutes a vital component of solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. The demand for extensive temporal and spatial coverage of DR data has intensified in the realms of solar energy harvesting, agriculture, and climate change. However, until now, long-term DR observations have only been available from 17 stations across mainland China. Consequently, there is a pressing need to estimate spatially continuous, high-temporal-resolution DR for large-scale regions in China. The current hindrance to DR estimations stems from the scarcity of stations equipped with DR observations. This study proposes a two-stage strategy to efficiently estimate seamless DR in 2019 at a national scale, leveraging both DR and total solar radiation (TR) observations from numerous stations. In the first stage, the approach generates virtual DR at TR stations by establishing a learned relationship between DR and TR observations. Subsequently, in the second stage, these virtual DR data, in conjunction with satellite and reanalysis datasets, are utilized to estimate national-scale DR. Additionally, a novel model, End-to-end Gradient Boosting with Shortcuts and Feature selection (EGB-SF), is introduced to estimate DR over China. One advantage of this model is its consideration of the impact of sequentially boosted features and their interactions. Embedded shortcut connections fully exploit the influence of existing features on newly introduced ones during the learning process. Beyond enhancing the accuracy of DR estimation, the EGB-SF algorithm can also elucidate the relative importance levels of input features to the model. Moreover, the two-stage strategy outperforms the method of estimating national DR using only DR observations, as evidenced by its superior spatial generalization abilities.

10.1016/j.rse.2024.114442,True,Remote Sensing of Environment,这篇论文研究了一种新的城市导向混合方法（UoHy），用于利用高空间分辨率热红外图像的顶层大气辐射来估计城市地表长波辐射（SELR）。该方法考虑了城市像素的多重散射和邻近效应，并利用天空视因子进行计算。实验结果表明，UoHy 方法在低大气水汽条件下 SELR 误差小于 12.0 W/m2，在高大气水汽条件下 SELR 误差小于 17.0 W/m2。该方法在白天和夜间的应用也证明了其有效性。与自然表面导向混合方法相比，UoHy 方法在 SELR 估计方面提高了约 7.0-10.0 W/m2，表明该方法具有利用高空间分辨率热红外图像对城市地表进行 SELR 估计的潜力。,"['surface-emitted longwave radiation', 'SELR', 'thermal infrared', 'TIR', 'satellite observations', 'GF-5/VIMS', 'urban surface', 'atmospheric water vapor']",Songyi Lin;Huazhong Ren;Rongyuan Liu;Jinxiang Li;Shanshan Chen;Yuanjian Teng;Wenjie Fan;Baozhen Wang;Yu Liu,Urban surface-emitted longwave radiation estimation from high spatial resolution thermal infrared images using a hybrid method,"•New UoHy method is proposed to estimate urban SELR from TOA thermal radiances. •SELR accuracy of the UoHy method is 12.0–17.0 W/m2for different conditions. •New method improves 7.0–10.0 W/m2for SELR compared to flat-surface method. 
 Accurate estimation of the surface-emitted longwave radiation (SELR) has important scientific value in understanding its spatiotemporal dynamics and surface thermal environment. Thermal infrared (TIR) images with high spatial resolution offer enhanced data support for studying SELR of complex surfaces, such as urban surface. This study proposes a new urban-oriented hybrid (UoHy) method, which considers multiple scattering and adjacent effects of urban pixel using the term sky view factor, to estimate urban SELR from the top-of-atmosphere radiance of TIR images with high spatial resolution, and performs sensitivity analysis and application. The experimental results for the thermal images of GF-5/VIMS as an example showed that the UoHy method has relatively high accuracy, and obtains SELR errors of less than 12.0 W/m2 under low atmospheric water vapor conditions and less than 17.0 W/m2 under high atmospheric water vapor conditions. The application of the method during daytime and nighttime also demonstrated the method's validity and effectiveness. Compared with the natural surface-oriented hybrid method, the UoHy method obtains an improvement of about 7.0–10.0 W/m2 in SELR estimation, which indicates that it has the potential for practical SELR estimation over urban surface with TIR images of high spatial resolution."
10.1016/j.rse.2024.114443,True,Remote Sensing of Environment,这篇论文研究了利用卫星测高数据推断西北太平洋黑潮路径的变化。黑潮是西北太平洋重要的洋流，其路径变化对区域海洋学有着重要影响。论文使用了一种基于最大地转流速的自动等高线方法来追踪黑潮路径，并分析了其在不同区域的变化特征。研究发现，黑潮路径在台湾和吕宋海峡附近变化较大，而北纬26°以北则相对稳定。这种变化主要受中尺度涡旋的影响，涡旋的侵入会使黑潮路径发生扭曲和变形。论文还分析了黑潮路径变化的时间尺度，发现其主要受30-200天和1年的时间尺度影响。论文的结果与历史船舶观测和岸基高频雷达观测结果一致，为理解黑潮路径变化提供了新的视角。,"['satellite altimetry', 'sea surface topography', 'oceanographic', 'Kuroshio current', 'eddy', 'path variability']",Ying-Chih Fang;Wei-Teh Li;Shao-Hua Chen,Kuroshio path variability inferred from satellite-derived sea surface topography in the northwestern Pacific,"•The Kuroshio path (KP) is derived by satellite altimetry product. •The derived KP is relatively stable north of 26°N. •The KP fluctuates substantially near Taiwan and the Luzon Strait. •Eddy impingement is the main factor controlling robustness of the derived KP. •The derived KP is consistent with measurements from other platforms. 
 The Kuroshio has a fundamental impact on the regional oceanography of the northwestern Pacific. But identification of the Kuroshio path (KP), an abstraction of the course along which the Kuroshio mainstream moves, has not yet been established in a systematic manner. We optimally track the KP and study its variability in the northwestern Pacific south of ∼31°N, where eddy activity is rich. An automatic contour method based on maximum surface geostrophic velocity along a given satellite-derived dynamic topographic isoline is applied and its performance is evaluated. Our results are robust and can be further used to derive kinematical, statistical, and spectral properties of the flow field of the Kuroshio upstream. We improve the identification method by tracing two separate KPs in different subdomains. The existence of an alignment or mismatch of these two retrieved KPs hints at the arrival of an approaching eddy. The highly variable and distorted KP east of Luzon Strait and Taiwan is due to eddy impingement. Most of the variability along the KP stems from energy with time scales of ∼30–200 days and 1 year. A more consistent KP is seen north of ∼26°N, with increasing surface currents of up to ∼1 m s−1 before entering through the Tokara Strait. Such regional differences result from the various impacts of impinging mesoscale eddies on the Kuroshio, mainly due to blockage by the Ryukyu Islands. Our optimally determined KP is in line with the historical shipborne subsurface velocity measurements revealing the Kuroshio velocity core and observations of strong surface currents of > ∼0.5 m s−1 by shore-based high-frequency radar (HFR) from locations along the east coast of Taiwan. Supportive evidence of concurrent KP distortion shows that HFR-derived vortex-like flow patterns are related to mesoscale eddies impinging from regions east of the radar footprint. Our work has value as a supplement to the data from radar operational routines, and will help interpret and diagnose these complicated HFR observations east of Taiwan."

 In recent years, deep learning has been widely applied to meteorological radar extrapolation due to the shortcomings of traditional optical flow methods in predicting the genesis and dissipation of radar echoes. However, it still faces challenges in addressing issues of clarity and overall intensity attenuation caused by uncertainty. This study implemented a dual-path spatiotemporal attention network that integrates optical flow techniques by employing intra-frame static attention and inter-frame dynamic attention, which could simulate motion fields and the overall intensity distribution of radar echoes separately. Our approach effectively resolve the issues of systematic intensity attenuation and clarity degradation introduced by deep learning methods. Through the comparisons of key metrics such as MSE, SSIM, CSI20, CSI30, and CSI40, the results demonstrated significant improvements over traditional approaches, particularly in CSI30 and CSI40, where the metrics improved by more than 35 %."

 The timing of the Bay of Bengal summer monsoon (BOBSM) onset has implications for the evolution of the Asian summer monsoon and associated precipitation. This study employs Japanese 55-year Reanalysis and NOAA's Gridded Precipitation Reconstruction over Land data to explore the spatiotemporal variation in the thermal influence of the Southeast Asian low-latitude highlands (SEALLH) and its effect on the BOBSM onset date. There is a significant correlation between pre-monsoon season (February–April) shortwave radiative heating (SWH) in the SEALLH and BOBSM onset in the interannual time scale. During the enhanced SWH, an anomalous vertical circulation, which converges and ascends in the lower troposphere over the SEALLH and converges and descends in the upper troposphere north of the Bay of Bengal (BOB), develops over the SEALLH–north of BOB during the pre-monsoon season with anticlockwise rotation. The warmer air mass resulting from the adiabatic heating is accumulated around the north of BOB by the insulation effect related to the anomalous vertical circulation. By facilitating the reversal of the land-sea thermal contrast, the warmer upper troposphere over the north of the BOB causes a 16-day earlier onset of the BOBSM than the case of weakened SWH. The findings shed light on subsequent research into the thermal effects of the SEALLH on Asian summer monsoon variability."

 This study explores a possibility of improving Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) surface-sensitive brightness temperature (TB) simulations over land by assimilating land surface temperature (LST) observations from the National Basic Meteorological Observing Stations of China. The Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation 3D-Var regional data assimilation (DA) system is modified to add LST as a new control variable and its background error variances, horizontal correlations and cross-correlations. The background covariances of LST with other control variables are calculated separately for daytime and nighttime samples in summer and winter seasons. A control experiment (ExpCTL) and three LST DA experiments with (ExpLST) and without (ExpLST_NBC) bias correction or with an average of LST within 2° × 2° grid boxes (ExpLST_SO) are conducted. Considering the fact that surface station observations are point measurements while the satellite TBs measure the total radiation effect of earth's surface within fields-of-view, a bias correction is found necessary for LST DA during daytimes (ExpLST). The biases are quantified by the differences from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LST retrievals to compensate for the representative differences. The analyzed fields are then used as input to the Community Radiative Transfer Model to simulate TBs of AHI surface-sensitive channels over land. A long-period statistics shows that ExpLST significantly reduces the observations minus simulations (OB) biases and standard deviations of surface-sensitive TBs in terms of reducing the diurnal variations and season dependences of TB biases over different surface types, which also outperforms ExpLST_NBC and ExpLST_SO at daytime. This study suggests a potential benefit of combining the use of LST observations for assimilating surface-sensitive infrared TBs."
