10.1088/1748-9326/ad6019,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是陆地表面模型分辨率对北极地区土壤状态和通量的影响。研究使用JSBACH3模型模拟了不同分辨率的陆地边界条件对土壤物理、水文和植被相互作用的影响。研究发现，分辨率对模型结果有显著影响，尤其是对土壤有机质含量和过冷水的非线性垂直离散化。这表明在北极地区进行陆地表面模型模拟时需要考虑分辨率的影响。论文没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['land surface model', 'soil state', 'fluxes', 'resolution', 'Arctic']",Meike Schickhoff;Philipp de Vrese;Annett Bartsch;Barbara Widhalm;Victor Brovkin,Effects of land surface model resolution on fluxes and soil state in the Arctic,"Arctic land is characterized by a high surface and subsurface heterogeneity on different scales. However, the effects of land surface model resolution on fluxes and soil state variables in the Arctic have never been systematically studied, even though smaller scale heterogeneities are resolved in high-resolution land boundary condition datasets. Here, we compare 210 km and 5 km setups of the land surface model JSBACH3 for an idealized case study in eastern Siberia to investigate the effects of high versus low-resolution land boundary conditions on simulating the interactions of soil physics, hydrology and vegetation. We show for the first time that there are differences in the spatial averages of the simulated fluxes and soil state variables between resolution setups. Most differences are small in the summer mean, but larger within individual months. Heterogeneous soil properties induce large parts of the differences while vegetation characteristics play a minor role. Active layer depth shows a statistically significant increase of +20% in the 5 km setup relative to the 210 km setup for the summer mean and +43% for August. The differences are due to the nonlinear vertical discretization of the soil column amplifying the impact of the heterogeneous distributions of soil organic matter content and supercooled water. Resolution-induced differences in evaporation fluxes amount to +43% in July and are statistically significant. Our results show that spatial resolution significantly affects model outcomes due to nonlinear processes in heterogenous land surfaces. This suggests that resolution needs to be accounted in simulations of land surface models in the Arctic."

We assessed recent peat forest disturbances and their direct drivers from 2019 to 2021 in Cuvette Centrale, spanning the Republic of Congo (ROC) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Utilizing peatland maps and Radar for Detecting Deforestation alert data, we analyzed spatial and temporal patterns of disturbances. Further, we examined 2267 randomly sampled peat forest disturbance events through visual interpretation of monthly Planet and Sentinel 2A data to identify direct drivers. Our findings revealed that between 2019 and 2021, about 91% of disturbances occurred in DRC, with hotspots concentrated in the northwest Sud-Ubangi district. Disturbances predominantly followed a sharp seasonal pattern, recurring during the first half of each year with temporal hotspots emerging between February and May, closely associated with smallholder agriculture activities. Smallholder agriculture accounted for over 88% of disturbances in Cuvette Centrale, representing a leading role both in ROC (∼77%) and DRC (∼89%). While small-scale logging contributed 7% to the disturbances in the region, it constituted an important driver (18%) in the ROC. Other drivers included floods, roads, and settlements. Approximately 77% of disturbances occurred outside managed forest concessions in Cuvette Centrale, with 40% extending into protected areas. About 90% of disturbances were concentrated within 1 km of peat forest edges and ∼76% of the disturbances occurred within 5 km of road or river networks. The insights underscore the crucial need for effective peat forest conservation strategies in Cuvette Centrale and can inform national policies targeting peatland protection, aligning with commitments in the Brazzaville Declaration and the Paris Agreement. Further, our findings on direct driver assessment could serve as a reference dataset for machine learning models to automate the visual interpretation and upscale the assessment across the entire region."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad677d,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究使用气候模型模拟了三个热带海洋（印度洋、太平洋和北大西洋）对西太平洋反气旋（WNPAC）年际变率的相对贡献。研究发现，太平洋对冬季和春季WNPAC年际变化的贡献超过50%，而大西洋和印度洋在春季的作用更加明显。在夏季，三个海洋对WNPAC的贡献都很大且相当。印度洋海表温度受太平洋遥感的影响，而大西洋则相对独立，不受其他海洋的影响。该研究使用了气候模型，并通过模拟实验来量化不同海洋对WNPAC的影响，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['satellite observations', 'sea surface temperature', 'atmospheric circulation', 'climate modeling', 'El Niño', 'East Asian summer monsoon']",Zhiyuan Lu;Lu Dong;Fengfei Song;Bo Wu;Shuyan Wu;Chunzai Wang,Quantifying the relative contributions of three tropical oceans to the western North Pacific anomalous anticyclone,"The western North Pacific anomalous anticyclone (WNPAC) often exists during the mature and decaying phases of El Niño, significantly affecting the East Asian summer monsoon. Previous studies have revealed the importance of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in generating and maintaining the WNPAC. However, a quantitative comparison of the contributions from these three oceans is still lacking. This study uses pacemaker experiments with a state-of-the-art model to quantify the relative contributions of the three tropical oceans to the interannual WNPAC variability. We find that the Pacific accounts for over 50% of the interannual variance in boreal winter and the following spring, while the roles of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans become more pronounced in the spring. In the summer, all three oceans contribute significantly and equally. The Indian Ocean sea surface temperature is influenced by remote forcing from the Pacific Ocean, while the Atlantic Ocean operates more independently, with no evident effect from other oceans."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6781,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注气候变化适应策略，特别是洪水风险的应对措施，研究了公众对两种策略（搬迁和防洪基础设施建设）的支持度。研究方法是通过选择实验，比较了两种策略在不同条件下的公众支持率。研究结果表明，即使在搬迁可能更具吸引力的条件下，公众对防洪基础设施建设的支持度仍然很高。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，没有涉及空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等方面。,[],Jan Freihardt;Mark T Buntaine;Thomas Bernauer,Choosing to protect: public support for flood defense over relocation in climate change adaptation,"Policy makers worldwide face tough choices over how to prioritize public funding for adaptation to climate change. One particularly difficult choice is whether to opt for policies that promote relocation away from flood risks or infrastructure investments that protect against flooding. Local communities commonly prefer protective infrastructure, but it is less obvious that the general public will support this approach due to the growing costs. We study public opinion on these adaptation approaches using a choice experiment with nationally representative samples in the United States and Germany (n = 2400 each). We asked participants to prioritize federal funding between two hypothetical, equally sized communities differing in their adaptation strategy, flood frequency, lives and economic assets at risk, economic vitality, geographic distance, and political orientation. In both countries, we find surprisingly strong support for protective infrastructure over relocation policies among the general public, even under conditions where relocation could be an attractive alternative for addressing the growing costs of protective infrastructure and rebuilding efforts."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6886,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注长江三角洲地区持续性复合高温事件，分析了10-30天大气振荡对该地区复合高温事件的影响，以及对当地电力需求和供应的影响。研究发现，复合高温事件与10-30天气温变化密切相关，并与高层大气位势涡度异常的偶极子模式有关。该模式导致长江三角洲地区异常下降气流和低层大气反气旋，从而导致白天极端高温和夜间极端高温。研究还分析了10-30天大气季节内振荡对电力需求和供应的潜在影响。虽然10-30天大气季节内振荡对风能资源的影响较弱，但偶极子模式的位势涡度异常会显著减少黄河中下游地区的太阳能资源，从而对长江三角洲地区的电力供应构成更大的挑战。,"['atmospheric oscillation', 'compound heatwaves', 'potential vorticity', 'electricity demand', 'electricity supply', 'solar energy', 'wind energy']",Jianying Li;Qingyao Xiao;Yang Chen;Jiangyu Mao;Lili Song;Panmao Zhai;Shu Wang,Impacts of 10–30-day atmospheric oscillation on persistent compound heatwaves in the Yangtze River Delta with implications for local electricity demand and supply,"The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is a hotspot of compound heatwaves characterized by scorching day and sweltering night persisting for more than 3 days. The YRD compound heatwaves are intimately associated with the 10–30-day variations of air temperature, with 46 identified heatwaves during the summers of 1979–2022 mostly occurring within the positive phases of 10–30-day Tmax and Tmin anomalies. The coincidence of positive phases in 10–30-day Tmax and Tmin comes from a dipole pattern of the corresponding potential vorticity (PV) anomalies in the upper troposphere. This dipole PV pattern leads to anomalous descents in the YRD and associated anticyclones in the lower troposphere. As a result, the increased adiabatic heating and incident solar radiation cause the extreme daytime heat. The enhanced humidity in the YRD increases the downward longwave radiation, resulting in the extreme nighttime temperatures. As the increased temperature and humidity enhance stratification stability in the lower troposphere, the coupling between daytime and nighttime heat extremes persists, leading to a compound heatwave. During a YRD compound heatwave, the 10–30-day atmospheric intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) exerts a potential influence on the electricity demand and supply. Continuous extreme heat leads to a dramatic surge in cooling demand. While the influence of 10–30-day ISO on wind energy resources is weak, the dipole pattern of 10–30-day PV anomalies strongly reduces solar energy resources over the mid–lower reaches of the Yellow River, thus exerting greater challenges for electricity supply to the YRD."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6a72,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注了2020年和2022年东亚夏季极端气候事件（洪水和干旱）的成因，并分析了西太平洋副热带高压（WPSH）和东亚副热带急流（EASJ）在其中扮演的角色。研究发现，尽管2020年和2022年都出现了异常强烈的WPSH，但由于EASJ的南北移动导致的经向风变化，导致了两种不同的极端气候事件。该研究主要集中在对流层中垂直运动的分析，并探讨了其与大气环流之间的关系，并未涉及到大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。,"['zonal flow', 'subtropical jet', 'western Pacific subtropical high', 'precipitation variability', 'vertical motion', 'drought', 'flood', 'Tibetan Plateau', 'East Asian subtropical jet']",Chao He;Matthew Collins;Tianjun Zhou;Xingwen Jiang;Peili Wu;Nick Dunstone,Contrasting East Asian climate extremes in 2020 and 2022 tied to zonal flow,"Subtropical East Asia (STEA) experienced a historic flood in the summer of 2020, and historic drought and heatwaves in the summer of 2022. Previous studies emphasized the role of western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), but there is a paradox that the contrasting climate extremes over STEA in 2020 and 2022 are both associated with anomalously strong WPSH. Given that local vertical motion has a dominant control on precipitation variability, here we investigate the mechanism for the variability of vertical motion in STEA. In most extratropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, ascent (descent) motion aligns with southerly (northerly) flow in the troposphere due to the northward tilting isentropic surfaces. However, isentropic surfaces tilt eastwards over STEA in the summer due to the existence of a strong warm center over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Thus, the ascent motion over the STEA is insensitive to the strength of southerly flow related to the intensity of the WPSH but sensitive to the strength of westerly flow related to the meridional shift of subtropical jet. The notably strong WPSH in 2020 and 2022 increased water vapor transport into STEA but had little impact on atmospheric vertical motion. However, the East Asian subtropical jet displaced southwards (northwards) in the summer of 2020 (2022), leading to anomalous westerly (easterly) flows in the mid-upper troposphere from TP to STEA on the jet’s southern flank, prompting anomalous ascent (descent) motion in STEA that contributed to the flood (drought) conditions in 2020 (2022). Our results highlight the essential role of anomalous zonal flow in generating surface climate extremes over STEA in the summer because of its strong control of vertical motion."

While considerable attention has been paid to current and future changes in temperature patterns, comparatively less attention has been devoted to water availability for humans and ecosystems. The aridity index (AI), the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration, is a common metric used to assess water availability within ecosystems. However, the role of snow in AI calculations within snowy eco-regions is often neglected, resulting in an incomplete understanding of water balance dynamics in these environments. In this study, we estimate aridification under ongoing climate change in Andean eco-regions (AEs), focusing on two horizons: 2050–2060 and 2090–2100. Using monthly TerraClimate data from 2013–2018, we calculated a mean AI for each AE, taking into account the absence of snow (pixels with a snow water equivalent (SWE) < 10 mm/month) and its presence (AI-snow; pixels with a SWE > 10 mm/month). We show that AI allows to differentiate the eco-regions, but that the incorporation of snow in the AI calculation highlights the heterogeneity of aridity conditions within some eco-regions with energy-limited regimes (AI > 1) in the snowy zones and water-limited regimes (AI < 1) elsewhere. Analysis of the CORDEX-SAM regional projections for the periods 2050–2060 and 2090–2100 indicates a general shift towards drier conditions prevailing over wetter conditions in most eco-regions, notably: the Southern Andean Steppe, the Central Andean Wet Puna, the Santa Marta Páramo, and the Peruvian Yungas. The projected reduction in snowfall in CORDEX-SAM, coupled with glacier volume loss, appears to be contributing to the prevalence of aridification across many AEs. These findings highlight potential transitions towards aridification in diverse eco-regions, with repercussions on water availability for humans and ecosystems."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6fb8,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注美国煤电厂改造为天然气发电厂对水资源使用和碳排放的影响。研究使用面板数据和事件研究方法，分析了2013年至2022年期间，美国大陆地区煤电厂改造为天然气发电厂后的水资源消耗、排放和碳排放变化。研究发现，将煤电厂改造为天然气联合循环发电厂，可以显著减少每兆瓦时电力生产的水资源消耗和碳排放，而锅炉改造对水资源消耗、排放和碳排放没有显著影响。该研究强调了在能源转型过程中，需要考虑水资源与电力生产之间的相互依赖关系，以实现可持续发展目标。,"['water withdrawal', 'water consumption', 'water discharge', 'carbon emissions', 'coal-to-gas retrofits', 'power plants']",Kate Hua-Ke Chi;Melissa McCracken,Water usage in cooling systems for electricity production: an event study of retrofitted coal-fired power plants in the United States,"Thermoelectric power plants account for approximately 40% of total U.S. water withdrawals each year. In 2022, 48.5 trillion gallons of water were withdrawn for cooling systems in electricity production, of which 962.9 billion gallons of water were consumed and no longer available for downstream use. Conventional steam coal plants, in particular, withdrew 18.3 trillion gallons of water for once-through and recirculating cooling systems in 2022 while contributing to 19.7% of total U.S. net electricity generation. As coal-fueled electricity production becomes less competitive, cases of coal-to-gas retrofits occur to avoid stranded assets. Two retrofitting methods are adopted in practice: coal-fired power plants are repurposed and replaced by natural gas combined-cycle plants, or the boiler of a coal plant is converted to burn natural gas. In this study, we construct panel data and employ an event study framework to examine changes in water withdrawal, water consumption, water discharge, and carbon emissions resulting from coal-to-gas retrofits in the continental United States from 2013 to 2022. Seventeen coal-fired power plants have been replaced with natural gas combined-cycle plants, and 167 coal steam units in 85 plants have undergone coal-to-gas boiler conversions. We find a sharp and sustained reduction in water withdrawal of 40.2–53.9 thousand gallons per megawatt-hour of net electricity produced when a coal plant transitioned to a natural gas combined-cycle plant. Water discharge was also reduced by 30.7 thousand gallons, and carbon emissions decreased by 0.59 short tons per megawatt-hour. Yet, boiler conversion did not lead to statistically significant changes in per megawatt-hour water withdrawal, water consumption, water discharge, or carbon emissions. Spatial assessment further informs resource planning of projected water-stressed regions, as 204.6 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants remain operable in the United States in 2022. Fuel transition should adopt a nexus approach and account for the interdependence between water resources and electricity production to realize sustainable development commitments."

However, few studies have examined how this relationship endures in the face of experience with climate-related hazards and associated emotions, and whether detachment from place may be related to future migration. Here we address this gap using cross-sectional survey data from a representative probability-based sample of 1479 residents of Texas and Florida—areas frequently affected by coastal hazards—to investigate the interplay between place attachment, place detachment, negative hazard experiences, hazard-related fear and worry, and prospective migration. We found that place attachment and detachment were inversely associated with one another, and that hazard-related fear and worry was associated with higher place detachment. Results indicated that place detachment and hazard-related fear and worry were positively associated with prospective migration, while place attachment was negatively associated with prospective migration. The absence of place attachment and presence of detachment may lower psychological barriers to relocation in the face of climate change. Negative hazard experiences were not associated with place attachment, place detachment, or prospective migration. However, our post-hoc analyses found an indirect association between negative hazard experiences and prospective migration, mediated by hazard-related fear and worry. This suggests that psychological correlates of climate hazards, possibly arising from experiencing them, may inform people’s sense of place and future migration decisions. Our findings highlight the salience of relationships with place in migration decisions and stress the importance of explicitly examining negative sentiments towards place in migration studies. These insights can both improve climate migration models and help tailor policies and programs aimed at supporting detached, fearful, and worried individuals in anticipation of future climate-related hazards."

Grazing often affects the density and diversity of grassland soil seed banks; however, it is not clear how these effects vary on a global scale with grazing intensity, grazing duration, and climatic conditions. Here, we screened 92 independent published articles and performed a meta-analysis of the extracted data. The effects of grazing on four soil seed bank density and diversity indices were analyzed. Four alpha diversity indices, namely Shannon–Wiener, Margalef, Pielou, and Simpson indices, were selected in this study. The Shannon–Wiener index reflects the species complexity of the community. The Margalef index reflects species richness of the seed bank. The Pielou index reflects whether the number of seeds of all species in the seed bank is evenly distributed, and the Simpson’s index reflects the status of dominant plants in the seed bank. We found that grazing significantly decreased the total density of soil seed banks. Perennial plant seed banks were more affected by grazing than annual plant seed banks. Heavy grazing significantly decreased the Margalef index of seed banks, while moderate grazing significantly decreased the Simpson’s alpha diversity index. Long-term grazing (>10 years) had the greatest impact on Simpson’s alpha diversity index, while medium-term grazing (5–10 years) had a significant negative impact on Shannon–Wiener, Margalef, and Pielou indices. In addition, our results show that grazing has a greater effect on seed banks in arid areas than those in temperate areas. Knowledge of climate-specific effects will contribute to understanding the risk of local extinctions in grassland populations and help decision-makers maintain the health of grassland ecosystems."

This paper explores the complex interplay between mineral mining, socio-environmental impacts, and conflicts in the Southern and West African region, with a focus on the imperative of reflexive governance for achieving just transitions and environmental justice. Drawing on a comprehensive literature review and cases from Southern and Western African countries, this paper examines the multifaceted nature of socio-environmental impacts resulting from mineral mining. These impacts encompass ecological degradation and social inequalities, among others. Furthermore, the paper delves into the dynamics of conflicts arising from mineral mining and competing interests such as natural resources and land rights. Additionally, the paper examines governance structures aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and environmental sustainability. The paper concludes by highlighting the implications of reflexive governance as a transformative tool for addressing the socio-environmental impacts of mineral mining and conflicts in Southern and West Africa. It underscores the urgency of adopting holistic and integrated approaches that prioritize environmental protection, social equity, and community well-being in the context of mineral resource extraction. The African Union can serve as the catalyst for reflexive governance and environmental justice in mineral resource extraction, with citizens also holding national governments accountable."

However, the majority of previous studies have focused on overall effects of WWT, and very few have examined how land surface system responds to climate warming or wetting trend, respectively. For this purpose, this study uses the Community Land Model (CLM5) driven by the Chinese Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) to conduct four modeling experiments: a control experiment (CTRL) and three sensitivity experiments, in which the annual trend of air temperature (NonWarm), precipitation (NonWet), and both (NonWWT) are removed from the CMFD from 1979 to 2018. Compared to CTRL, the land hydrological variables (i.e. soil moisture, runoff and evapotranspiration) show a visible reduction in magnitude, interannual variability, as well as annual trend in NonWet, while they are enhanced in NonWarm. In both NonWarm and NonWet, the magnitude and trend of both net radiation and sensible heat fluxes increase, with a more pronounced change in NonWWT. Further analysis indicates that the land surface processes are more sensitive to wetting trend than to warming trend. Among all land surface hydrological variables and energy variables, runoff and snow cover fraction are the most susceptible to climate change. Overall, the effects of climate change in Ta and Pr on surface hydrological variables are non-linearly offsetting, while the effects on surface energy budgets are non-linearly superimposed. Compared to warming trend, wetting trend plays a larger impact on the variability of land surface processes in NWC."

Therefore, it is crucial to examine the extent to which GHG-induced changes in regional climate variability, in isolation from changes in mean climate, contribute to the frequency of extreme weather events. In this study, I build upon the concept of the fraction of attributable risk (FAR) by introducing the fraction of preventable risk (FPR), allowing for the assessment of GHG forcing’s contribution to risk reduction in scenarios of decreasing risk extremes. Results derived from four global climate models indicate that while the predominant factor amplifying the frequency of hot extremes is the mean warming, with a 18-fold increase in probability and an attributable risk fraction of 0.96 to GHG forcing, changes in regional climate variability have already modified the probability of extremes. In South Asia, for instance, the 12-fold increase in hot extremes resulting from mean warming is compounded by an additional ∼3 times, solely attributed to the increased temperature variability. Conversely, during winter in the Arctic, the 10-fold increase in the frequency of hot extremes due to mean warming is offset by a ∼2.5-fold decrease resulting from diminished variability, with a preventable risk fraction of −0.55 to GHG forcing. Concerning heavy-precipitation events, in certain regions, GHG-induced changes in precipitation variability carry greater significance than changes in the mean. For example, in the West African summer monsoon region GHG forcing is amplifying the risk of extreme monsoon precipitation by ∼4 times. This amplified risk of potential flooding arises from increases in both mean precipitation and variability. Separating attribution metrics into mean and variability components offers valuable insights into region-specific mechanisms affecting extreme event frequency."

Subseasonal forecast of this event challenges the limits of rainy season predictability. Employing the integrated atmospheric model across scales and the Sunway supercomputer, we conducted ensemble one-month forecasts at global 3 km, variable 4–60 km, and global 60 km resolutions. The global convection-permitting forecast accurately captures the rainband, while other forecasts exhibited northward and weaker shifts due to the northward shifts of the atmospheric rivers over Japan, attributed to intensified Western North Pacific Subtropical High (WNPSH). Further, the double-ITCZ-like tropical rainfall pattern in Western Pacific in global convection-permitting forecast contributes to a more accurate WNPSH and rainband. In contrast, other forecasts show a single-ITCZ-like pattern in Western Pacific, leading to a northward-shifted WNPSH and rainband, advocating the importance of accurately representing tropical convections, as they can significantly affect mid-/high-latitude weather and climate."

In this study, we analysed the performance of 28 water vapour records between 1988 and 2014. We find sensitivity to surface warming generally outside expected ranges, attributed to breakpoints in individual record trends and differing representations of climate variability. The implication is that longer records are required for high confidence in assessing climate trends. 
 Since 2011, the Global Energy and Water cycle Exchanges (GEWEX) Water Vapor Assessment (G-VAP) has provided performance analyses for state-of-the-art reanalysis and satellite water vapour products to the GEWEX Data and Analysis Panel (GDAP) and the user community in general. A significant component of the work undertaken by G-VAP is to characterise the quality and uncertainty of these water vapour records to (i) ensure full exploitation and (ii) avoid incorrect use or interpretation of results. This study presents results from the second phase of G-VAP, where we have extended and expanded our analysis of total column water vapour (TCWV) from phase 1, in conjunction with updating the G-VAP archive. For version 2 of the archive, we consider 28 freely available and mature satellite and reanalysis data products, remapped to a regular longitude–latitude grid of 2° × 2° and on monthly time steps between January 1979 and December 2019. We first analysed all records for a “common” short period of 5 years (2005–2009), focusing on variability (spatial and seasonal) and deviation from the ensemble mean. We observed that clear-sky daytime-only satellite products were generally drier than the ensemble mean, and seasonal variability/disparity in several regions up to 12 kg m−2 related to original spatial resolution and temporal sampling. For 11 of the 28 data records, further analysis was undertaken between 1988–2014. Within this “long period”, key results show (i) trends between −1.18 ± 0.68 to 3.82 ± 3.94 kg m−2 per decade and −0.39 ± 0.27 to 1.24 ± 0.85 kg m−2 per decade were found over ice-free global oceans and land surfaces, respectively, and (ii) regression coefficients of TCWV against surface temperatures of 6.17 ± 0.24 to 27.02 ± 0.51 % K−1 over oceans (using sea surface temperature) and 3.00 ± 0.17 to 7.77 ± 0.16 % K−1 over land (using surface air temperature). It is important to note that trends estimated within G-VAP are used to identify issues in the data records rather than analyse climate change. Additionally, breakpoints have been identified and characterised for both land and ocean surfaces within this period. Finally, we present a spatial analysis of correlations to six climate indices within the long period, highlighting regional areas of significant positive and negative correlation and the level of agreement among records."

Fuentes;Elie Bou-Zeid,Estimating scalar turbulent fluxes with slow-response sensors in the stable atmospheric boundary layer,"The significance of surface–atmosphere exchanges of aerosol species to atmospheric composition is underscored by their rising concentrations that are modulating the Earth's climate and having detrimental consequences for human health and the environment. Estimating these exchanges, using field measurements, and offering alternative models are the aims here. Limitations in measuring some species misrepresent their actual exchanges, so our proposed models serve to better quantify them. 
 Conventional and recently developed approaches for estimating turbulent scalar fluxes under stable atmospheric conditions are evaluated, with a focus on gases for which fast sensors are not readily available. First, the relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) classical approach and a recently proposed mixing length parameterization, labeled A22, are tested against eddy-covariance computations. Using high-frequency measurements collected from two contrasting sites (the frozen tundra near Utqiaġvik, Alaska, and a sparsely vegetated grassland in Wendell, Idaho, during winter), it is shown that the REA and A22 models outperform the conventional Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) utilized widely to infer fluxes from mean gradients. Second, scenarios where slow trace gas sensors are the only viable option in field measurements are investigated using digital filtering applied to fast-response sensors to simulate their slow-response counterparts. With a filtered scalar signal, the observed filtered eddy-covariance fluxes are referred to here as large-eddy-covariance (LEC) fluxes. A virtual eddy accumulation (VEA) approach, akin to the REA model but not requiring a mechanical apparatus to separate the gas flows, is also formulated and tested. A22 outperforms VEA and LEC in predicting the observed unfiltered (total) eddy-covariance (EC) fluxes; however, VEA can still capture the LEC fluxes well. This finding motivates the introduction of a sensor response time correction into the VEA formulation to offset the effect of sensor filtering on the underestimated net averaged fluxes. The only needed parameter for this correction is the mean velocity at the instrument height, a surrogate of the advective timescale. The VEA approach is very suitable and simple to use with gas sensors of intermediate speed (∼ 0.5 to 1 Hz) and with conventional open- or closed-path setups."

The model directly incorporates the NO2 mixing height (NMH) into the methodological framework. The study underscores the importance of considering NMH when estimating ground-level NO2 from satellite column measurements and highlights the significant advantages of new-generation geostationary satellites in air quality monitoring. 
 The major link between satellite-derived vertical column densities (VCDs) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level concentrations is theoretically the NO2 mixing height (NMH). Various meteorological parameters have been used as a proxy for NMH in existing studies. This study developed a nested XGBoost machine learning model to convert VCDs of NO2 into ground-level NO2 concentrations across China using Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) measurements. This nested model was designed to directly incorporate NMH into the methodological framework to estimate satellite-derived ground-level NO2 concentrations. The inner machine learning model predicted the NMH from meteorological parameters, which were then input into the main XGBoost machine learning model to predict the ground-level NO2 concentrations from its VCDs. The inclusion of NMH significantly enhanced the accuracy of ground-level NO2 concentration estimates; i.e., the R2 values were improved from 0.73 to 0.93 in 10-fold cross-validation and from 0.88 to 0.99 in the fully trained model. Furthermore, NMH was identified as the second most important predictor variable, following the VCDs of NO2. Subsequently, the satellite-derived ground-level NO2 data were analyzed across subregions with varying geographic locations and urbanization levels. Highly populated areas typically experienced peak NO2 concentrations during the early morning rush hour, whereas areas categorized as lightly populated observed a slight increase in NO2 levels 1 or 2 h later, likely due to regional pollutant dispersion from urban sources. This study underscores the importance of incorporating NMH in estimating ground-level NO2 from satellite column measurements and highlights the significant advantages of geostationary satellites in providing detailed air pollution information at an hourly resolution."

In this region, the geostrophic balance breaks down, and the equatorial balance approximation takes over. The study encourages the use of RO wind fields for mesoscale climate monitoring for the equatorial region, showing a small improvement in the troposphere when including the meridional wind in the zonal-mean total wind speed. 
 Globally available and highly vertically resolved wind fields are crucial for the analysis of atmospheric dynamics for the benefit of climate studies. Most observation techniques have problems to fulfill these requirements. Especially in the tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere more wind data are required. In this study, we investigate the potential of radio-occultation (RO) data for climate-oriented wind field monitoring in the tropics, with a specific focus on the equatorial band within ± 5° latitude. In this region, the geostrophic balance breaks down, due to the Coriolis force term approaching zero, and the equatorial-balance equation becomes relevant. One aim is to understand how the individual wind components of the geostrophic-balance and equatorial-balance approximations bridge across the Equator and where each component breaks down. Our central aim focuses on the equatorial-balance approximation, testing its quality by comparison with ERA5 reanalysis data. The analysis of the zonal and meridional wind components showed that while the zonal wind was well reconstructed, it was difficult to estimate the meridional wind from the approximation. However, we still found a somewhat better agreement from including both components in the zonal-mean total wind speed in the troposphere. In the stratosphere, the meridional wind component is close to zero for physical reasons and has no relevant impact on the total wind speed. In general, the equatorial-balance approximation works best in the stratosphere. As a second aim, we investigated the systematic data bias between using the RO and ERA5 data and find it smaller than the bias resulting from the approximations. We also inspected the monthly-mean RO wind data over the full example year of 2009. The bias in the core region of highest quality of RO data, which is the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, was generally smaller than ± 2 m s−1. This is in line with the wind field requirements of the World Meteorological Organization. Overall, the study encourages the use of RO wind fields for regional-scale climate monitoring over the entire globe, including the equatorial region, and also showed a small improvement in the troposphere when including the meridional wind component in the zonal-mean total wind speed."

We successfully developed a new gridded rice calendar for monsoon Asia based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, which characterize transplanting and harvesting dates and the number of rice croppings in a comprehensive framework. Our rice calendar will be beneficial for rice management, production prediction, and the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions. 
 An accurate and spatially explicit large-scale rice calendar can enhance the understanding of agricultural practices and their ecological services, particularly in monsoon Asia. However, currently available global- or continental-scale rice calendars suffer from coarse resolution, poor recording, and outdated information; thus, they do not provide detailed and consistent information on rice phenology. To address this limitation, this study mapped a new (2019–2020) gridded (0.5°×0.5° resolution) rice calendar for monsoon Asia based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images. The novelty of this rice calendar lies in the development of a consistent optimal methodological framework that allows the spatially explicit characterization of the rice transplanting date, harvesting date, and number of rice cropping seasons. The methodological framework incorporates two steps: (1) detection of rice phenological dates and number of rice cropping seasons via the combination of a feature-based algorithm and the fitted Weibull function; (2) spatiotemporal integration of the detected transplanting and harvesting dates derived from Step 1 using von Mises maximum likelihood estimates. Results revealed that the proposed rice calendar can accurately identify the rice phenological dates for three croppings in monsoon Asia. When compared with single rice data from the census-based RiceAtlas calendar, the proposed calendar exhibited better results than the MODIS-based Rice Crop Calendar for Asia (RICA). It exhibited biases of 4 and −6 d for the transplanting and harvesting dates, respectively, with 10 and 15 d lower MAE values and 6 and 15 d lower RMSE values for the transplanting and harvesting dates, respectively. In total, the proposed rice calendar can detect single-, double-, and triple-rice-cropping seasons with an area of 0.53×106, 0.45×106, and 0.09×106 km2, respectively. This novel gridded rice calendar fills the gaps in 0.5° rice calendars across major global rice production areas, facilitating research on rice phenology that is relevant to climate change.

 Recent changes in climate and environment, influenced by both global and local factors, have had profound impacts on coastal ecosystem functioning and trajectories. By examining archived samples from ongoing ecological monitoring efforts, particularly focusing on bivalves like mussels and oysters, we gain a valuable long-term perspective on how ecosystems are responding at various scales.

A theory explaining and describing this behavior is developed. 
 Forecast error growth as a function of lead time of atmospheric phenomena is caused by initial and model errors. When studying the initial error growth, it may turn out that small-scale phenomena, which contribute little to the forecast product, significantly affect the ability to predict this product. The question under investigation is whether omitting these atmospheric phenomena will improve the predictability of the resulting value. The topic is studied in the extended Lorenz (2005) system. This system shows that omitting small spatiotemporal scales that significantly affect prediction ability will reduce predictability more than modeling it. In other words, a system with model error (omitting phenomena) will not improve predictability. A hypothesis explaining and describing this behavior is developed, with the difference between systems (model error) produced at each time step seen as the error of the initial conditions. The resulting model error is then defined as the sum of the increments of the time evolution of the initial conditions so defined. The hypothesis is compared to the fit parameters that define the model error in certain approximations of the average forecast error growth. Parameters are interpreted in this context, and the approximations are used to estimate the errors described in the hypothesis. A method is proposed to distinguish increments of prediction error growth from small-spatiotemporal-scale phenomena and model errors. Results are presented for the error growth of the ECMWF system, where a 40 % reduction in model error between 1987 and 2011 is calculated based on the developed hypothesis, while over the same period the instability (error growth rate) of the system with respect to initial condition errors has grown."

Data assimilation experiments were conducted to demonstrate the robustness and investigate the feasibility and applicability of NUCAS. The assimilation of ecosystem carbonyl sulfide (COS) fluxes improved the model performance in gross primary productivity, evapotranspiration, and sensible heat, showing that COS provides constraints on parameters relevant to carbon-, water-, and energy-related processes. 
 Modeling and predicting changes in the function and structure of the terrestrial biosphere and its feedbacks to climate change strongly depends on our ability to accurately represent interactions of the carbon and water cycles and energy exchange. However, carbon fluxes, hydrological status, and energy exchange simulated by process-based terrestrial ecosystem models are subject to significant uncertainties, largely due to the poorly calibrated parameters. In this work, an adjoint-based data assimilation system (Nanjing University Carbon Assimilation System; NUCAS v1.0) was developed, which is capable of assimilating multiple observations to optimize process parameters of a satellite-data-driven ecosystem model – the Biosphere–atmosphere Exchange Process Simulator (BEPS). Data assimilation experiments were conducted to investigate the robustness of NUCAS and to test the feasibility and applicability of assimilating carbonyl sulfide (COS) fluxes from seven sites to enhance our understanding of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis. Results showed that NUCAS is able to achieve a consistent fit to COS observations across various ecosystems, including evergreen needleleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, C3 grass, and C3 crop. Comparing model simulations with validation datasets, we found that assimilating COS fluxes notably improves the model performance in gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration, with average root-mean-square error (RMSE) reductions of 23.54 % and 16.96 %, respectively. We also showed that NUCAS is capable of constraining parameters through assimilating observations from two sites simultaneously and achieving a good consistency with single-site assimilation. Our results demonstrate that COS can provide constraints on parameters relevant to water, energy, and carbon processes with the data assimilation system and opens new perspectives for better understanding of the ecosystem carbon, water, and energy exchanges."

A dynamic C / N ratio is introduced to represent plant resistance and self-adjustment. The framework has been implemented in a coupled biophysical-ecosystem–biogeochemical model, and testing results show a general improvement in simulating plant properties with this framework. 
 Plant and microbial nitrogen (N) dynamics and N availability regulate the photosynthetic capacity and capture, allocation, and turnover of carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems. Studies have shown that a wide divergence in representations of N dynamics in land surface models leads to large uncertainties in the biogeochemical cycle of terrestrial ecosystems and then in climate simulations as well as the projections of future trajectories. In this study, a plant C–N interface coupling framework is developed and implemented in a coupled biophysical-ecosystem–biogeochemical model (SSiB5/TRIFFID/DayCent-SOM v1.0). The main concept and structure of this plant C–N framework and its coupling strategy are presented in this study. This framework takes more plant N-related processes into account. The dynamic C/N ratio (CNR) for each plant functional type (PFT) is introduced to consider plant resistance and adaptation to N availability to better evaluate the plant response to N limitation. Furthermore, when available N is less than plant N demand, plant growth is restricted by a lower maximum carboxylation capacity of RuBisCO (Vc,max), reducing gross primary productivity (GPP). In addition, a module for plant respiration rates is introduced by adjusting the respiration with different rates for different plant components at the same N concentration. Since insufficient N can potentially give rise to lags in plant phenology, the phenological scheme is also adjusted in response to N availability. All these considerations ensure a more comprehensive incorporation of N regulations to plant growth and C cycling. This new approach has been tested systematically to assess the effects of this coupling framework and N limitation on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Long-term measurements from flux tower sites with different PFTs and global satellite-derived products are employed as references to assess these effects. The results show a general improvement with the new plant C–N coupling framework, with more consistent emergent properties, such as GPP and leaf area index (LAI), compared to the observations. The main improvements occur in tropical Africa and boreal regions, accompanied by a decrease in the bias in global GPP and LAI by 16.3 % and 27.1 %, respectively."

Here, we present the novel synthetic biogeochemical float capabilities of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 and demonstrate their utility as a test bed to address these uncertainties. 
 Since their advent over 2 decades ago, autonomous Argo floats have revolutionized the field of oceanography, and, more recently, the addition of biogeochemical and biological sensors to these floats has greatly improved our understanding of carbon, nutrient, and oxygen cycling in the ocean. While Argo floats offer unprecedented horizontal, vertical, and temporal coverage of the global ocean, uncertainties remain about whether Argo sampling frequency and density capture the true spatiotemporal variability in physical, biogeochemical, and biological properties. As the true distributions of, e.g., temperature or oxygen are unknown, these uncertainties remain difficult to address with Argo floats alone. Numerical models with synthetic observing systems offer one potential avenue to address these uncertainties. Here, we implement synthetic biogeochemical Argo floats into the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2), which build on the Lagrangian In Situ Global High-Performance Particle Tracking (LIGHT) module in E3SMv2 (E3SMv2-LIGHT-bgcArgo-1.0). Since the synthetic floats sample the model fields at model run time, the end user defines the sampling protocol ahead of any model simulation, including the number and distribution of synthetic floats to be deployed, their sampling frequency, and the prognostic or diagnostic model fields to be sampled. Using a 6-year proof-of-concept simulation, we illustrate the utility of the synthetic floats in different case studies. In particular, we quantify the impact of (i) sampling density on the float-derived detection of deep-ocean change in temperature or oxygen and on float-derived estimates of phytoplankton phenology, (ii) sampling frequency and sea-ice cover on float trajectory lengths and hence float-derived estimates of current velocities, and (iii) short-term variability in ecosystem stressors on estimates of their seasonal variability."

 VERT (Vehicular Emissions from Road Traffic) is an R package developed to estimate traffic emissions of a wide range of pollutants and greenhouse gases based on traffic estimates and vehicle fleet composition data, following the EMEP/EEA methodology. Compared to other tools available in the literature, VERT is characterised by its ease of use and rapid configuration, while it maintains great flexibility in user input. It is capable of estimating exhaust, non-exhaust, resuspension, and evaporative emissions and is designed to accommodate future updates of available emission factors. In this paper, case studies conducted at both urban and regional scales demonstrate VERT's ability to accurately assess transport emissions. In an urban setting, VERT is integrated with the Lagrangian dispersion model GRAMM–GRAL and provides NOx concentrations in line with observed trends at monitoring stations, especially near traffic hotspots. On a regional scale, VERT simulations provide emission estimates that are highly consistent with the reference inventories for the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy). These findings make VERT a valuable tool for air quality management and traffic emission scenario assessment."

Juliano,The Community Fire Behavior Model for coupled fire-atmosphere modeling: Implementation in the Unified Forecast System,"We present the Community Fire Behavior model (CFBM) a fire behavior model designed to facilitate coupling to atmospheric models. We describe its implementation in the Unified Forecast System (UFS). Simulations of the Cameron Peak ire allowed us to verify our implementation. Our vision is to foster collaborative development in fire behavior modeling with the ultimate goal of increasing our fundamental understanding of fire science and minimizing the adverse impacts of wildland fires. 
 There is an increasing need for simulating the evolution of wildland fires. The realism of the simulation increases by accounting for feedbacks between the fire and the atmosphere. These coupled models combine a fire behavior model with a regional numerical weather prediction model and have been used for fire research during the last decades. This is the case, for instance, of the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting model with fire extensions (WRF-Fire). Typically, the coupling includes specific code for the particular models being coupled such as interpolation procedures to pass variables from the atmospheric grid to the fire grid, and vice versa. However, having a fire modeling framework that can be coupled to different atmospheric models is advantageous to foster collaborations and joint developments. With this aim, we have created, for the first time, a fire behavior model that can be connected to other atmospheric models without the need of developing specific low-level procedures for the particular atmospheric model being used. The fire behavior model, referred to as the Community Fire Behavior model (CFBM), closely follows WRF-Fire version 4.3.3 methods in its version 0.2.0, and makes use of the Earth System Modeling Framework library to communicate information between the fire and the atmosphere. The CFBM can be also run offline using an existing WRF simulation in what we refer to as the standalone model. Herein we describe the fire modeling framework and its implementation in the Unified Forecast System (UFS). Simulations of the Cameron Peak Fire performed with UFS and WRF-Fire are presented to verify our implementation. Results from both models, as well as with the standalone version, are consistent indicating a proper development of the CFBM and its coupling to the UFS-Atmosphere. These results, and the possibility of using the fire behavior model with other atmospheric models, provide an attractive collaborative framework to further improve the realism of the model in order to meet the growing demand for accurate wildland fire simulations."

In this study, the hydro-biogeochemical model of CNMM-DNDC was improved by incorporating a new forest growth module derived from the Biome-BGC. The updated model was validated using the multiple-year observed carbon fluxes and showed better performance in capturing the daily dynamics and annual variations. The sensitive eco-physiological parameters were also identified. 
 Carbon exchange between forest ecosystems and the atmosphere play an important role in global carbon cycle, which is difficult to be accurately quantified due to the large uncertainties in scaling up site-scale observations or filling-up measurement gaps. A process-oriented model equipped with comprehensive processes to explicitly simulating coupled carbon, nitrogen and water cycling, is hypothesized to reduce the uncertainties in quantification of forest carbon fluxes. To test this hypothesis, the Catchment Nutrient Management Model – DeNitrification-DeComposition (CNMM-DNDC), as a hydro-biogeochemical model that dynamically couples the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and water cycling processes, was updated in this study by incorporating a new forest growth module derived from the Biome-BGC model and validating the updates using multiple-year continuous observations of carbon and water fluxes at the site scale. The updated model has improved the processes of photosynthesis, litter decomposition, allocation, respiration and mortality to more effectively capture the transformation and transportation of nutrients in plant-soil-water continuum. The observed gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) of three typical forest sites subject to subtropical and temperate climates in eastern Asia (2003–2010) were used for the model calibration and validation. Compared with the original model in validation, the updated model showed significant improvements in simulating the daily dynamics and inter-annual variations of each variable, with the NRMSE values decreased by 46 % and 54 %, 65 % and 37 %, 4 % and -6 %, and 38 % and -3 % for GPP, ER, NEE, and ET on daily and annual scales, respectively. The comparable performances of both model versions for annual NEE emphasizes the importance of validating each component of carbon fluxes to avoid the offsetting of model errors. The canopy average specific leaf area, fraction of leaf nitrogen in Rubisco, annual leaf and fine root turnover fraction, maximum stomatal conductance and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in leaves and fine roots were identified as the sensitive eco-physiological parameters affecting the simulations of GPP and ER. In addition, the meteorological variables of solar radiation, humidity and air temperature also showed strong influences on the simulated GPP and ER. The relatively satisfactory performances demonstrated that the modified model has the ability to capture the daily dynamics and inter-annual variations of carbon fluxes for forests in temperate and subtropical zones, which is essential for estimating the emissions of greenhouse gases at the regional or global scales."

Traditional models struggle with accurately simulating burned areas due to simplified processes. By combining the predictive power of machine learning with a land model, our hybrid framework better captures fire dynamics. This approach enhances our understanding of wildfire behavior and aids in developing more effective climate and fire management strategies. 
 Wildfires have shown increasing trends in both frequency and severity across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). However, process-based fire models have difficulties in accurately simulating the burned area over the CONUS due to a simplification of the physical process and cannot capture the interplay among fire, ignition, climate, and human activities. The deficiency of burned area simulation deteriorates the description of fire impact on energy balance, water budget, and carbon fluxes in the Earth System Models (ESMs). Alternatively, machine learning (ML) based fire models, which capture statistical relationships between the burned area and environmental factors, have shown promising burned area predictions and corresponding fire impact simulation. We develop a hybrid framework (ML4Fire-XGB) that integrates a pretrained eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) wildfire model with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM) version 2.1. A Fortran-C-Python deep learning bridge is adapted to support online communication between ELM and the ML fire model. Specifically, the burned area predicted by the ML-based wildfire model is directly passed to ELM to adjust the carbon pool and vegetation dynamics after disturbance, which are then used as predictors in the ML-based fire model in the next time step. Evaluated against the historical burned area from Global Fire Emissions Database 5 from 2001–2020, the ML4Fire-XGB model outperforms process-based fire models in terms of spatial distribution and seasonal variations. Sensitivity analysis confirms that the ML4Fire-XGB well captures the responses of the burned area to rising temperatures. The ML4Fire-XGB model has proved to be a new tool for studying vegetation-fire interactions, and more importantly, enables seamless exploration of climate-fire feedback, working as an active component in E3SM."

Since BPA has been banned in maternal and infant food containers in many countries, BPA substitutes have been widely introduced to replace it. By systematically assessing the potential developmental toxicity of BPA substitutes, we observed that the 41–150 nM in vivo BPC exposure (around the reported concentration detected in infant urine: 6–186 nM) induced cardiac defects in zebrafish. Mechanistically, BPC disrupted m6A homeostasis by downregulation of the key m6A methyltransferase, Mettl3, thereby causing the m6A reader, Igf2bp2b, to fail in recognizing and stabilizing the inefficiently m6A-modified acox1 and tnnt2d mRNA. Then, downregulation of Acox1 (a regulator in cardiac fatty acid metabolism) and Tnnt2d (a component of cardiac troponin for muscle contraction) led to cardiac defects. Indeed, the dual cardiac functional axes regulated by the same m6A reader in response to BPC provided new insight into the regulatory mechanisms of epitranscriptomics and cardiac development. Collectively, our study not only presented evidence showing that the internal exposure levels of BPC in humans could lead to cardiac developmental defects but also demonstrated the underlying mechanism of BPC-mediated defects by disrupting the Mettl3-m6A-Igf2bp2b-Acox1/Tnnt2d pathways, which provided potential molecular markers associated with BPC exposure."

However, current studies mainly focus on separate evaluation or diagnosis, leading to an inadequate exploration of the relationship between stressors and responses. Here, based on multiple data sets in an urban lake system, a synchronous evaluation-diagnosis model with quantitative stressor-response analysis was advanced, aiming to improve the accuracy of evaluation and diagnosis. The weights for key physicochemical stressors were quantitatively determined in the sequence of NDAVIadj > CODMn > TP > NH4+–N by the combination of generalized additive model and structural equation modeling, clarifying the most significant effects of aquatic vegetation on the degradation of fish assemblages. Then, sensitive biological metrics were screened by considering the distinct contributions of four key stressors to alleviate the possible deviation caused by common methods. Finally, ecological integrity was evaluated by summing the key physicochemical stressors and sensitive biological metrics according to the model-deduced weights instead of empirical weights. Our system’s diagnosis and evaluation results achieved an accuracy of over 80% when predicting anthropogenic stress and biological status, which highlights the great potential of our multiple-level system for ecosystem management."

A sediment trap was moored at a depth of 4900 m at Station KEO within the Kuroshio Extension recirculation gyre, and the vertical flux of microplastics in sinking particles of size <1 mm was observed. Forty-one sediment-trap samples collected from July 1, 2014, to October 2, 2016, were analyzed with a micro-Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and microplastics were detected in all samples. Seventeen polymer types were identified, and 90% of the microplastics were less than 100 μm in size. Microplastic sinking was driven by the action of the biological pump, which was in turn driven by seasonal variations in solar radiation and increased surface primary production typical of the spring season. Microplastic mass flux varied from 4.5 × 10–3 to 0.38 mg m–2 day–1 during the sampling period, with a mean and standard deviation of 0.054 ± 0.075 mg m–2 day–1.

Deng,"Assimilating Morning, Evening, and Nighttime Greenhouse Gas Observations in Atmospheric Inversions","Improved urban greenhouse gas (GHG) flux estimates are crucial for informing policy and mitigation efforts. Atmospheric inversion modeling (AIM) is a widely used technique combining atmospheric measurements of trace gas, meteorological modeling, and a prior emission map to infer fluxes. Traditionally, AIM relies on mid‐afternoon observations due to the well‐represented atmospheric boundary layer in meteorological models. However, confining flux assessment to daytime observations is problematic for the urban scale, where air masses typically move over a city in a few hours and AIM therefore cannot provide improved constraints on emissions over the full diurnal cycle. We hypothesized that there are atmospheric conditions beyond the mid‐afternoon under which meteorological models also perform well. We tested this hypothesis using tower‐based measurements of CO2 and CH4, wind speed observations, weather model outputs from INFLUX (Indianapolis Flux Experiment), and a prior emissions map. By categorizing trace gas vertical gradients according to wind speed classes and identifying when the meteorological model satisfactorily simulates boundary layer depth (BLD), we found that non‐afternoon observations can be assimilated when wind speed is >5 m/s. This condition resulted in small modeled BLD biases (<40%) when compared to calmer conditions (>100%). For Indianapolis, 37% of the GHG measurements meet this wind speed criterion, almost tripling the observations retained for AIM. Similar results are expected for windy cities like Auckland, Melbourne, and Boston, potentially allowing AIM to assimilate up to 60% of the total (24‐hr) observations. Incorporating these observations in AIMs should yield a more diurnally comprehensive evaluation of urban GHG emissions."

Kaiser,Impact of Heatwaves and Declining NOx on Nocturnal Monoterpene Oxidation in the Urban Southeastern United States,"Nighttime oxidation of monoterpenes (MT) via the nitrate radical (NO3) and ozone (O3) contributes to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This study uses observations in Atlanta, Georgia from 2011 to 2022 to quantify trends in nighttime production of NO3 (PNO3) and O3 concentrations and compare to model outputs from the EPA's Air QUAlity TimE Series Project (EQUATES). We present urban‐suburban gradients in nighttime NO3 and O3 concentrations and quantify their fractional importance (F) for MT oxidation. Both observations and EQUATES show a decline in PNO3, with modeled PNO3 declining faster than observations. Despite decreasing PNO3, we find that NO3 continues to dominate nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) MT oxidation (FNO3 = 60%) in 2017, 2021, and 2022, which is consistent with EQUATES (FNO3 = 80%) from 2013 to 2019. This contrasts an anticipated decline in FNO3 based on prior observations in the nighttime residual layer, where O3 is the dominant oxidant. Using two case studies of heatwaves in summer 2022, we show that extreme heat events can increase NO3 concentrations and FNO3, leading to short MT lifetimes (<1 hr) and high gas‐phase organic nitrate production. Regardless of the presence of heatwaves, our findings suggest sustained organic nitrate aerosol formation in the urban SE US under declining NOx emissions, and highlight the need for improved representation of extreme heat events in chemistry‐transport models and additional observations along urban to rural gradients."

Recent researches focusing on precipitation Δ′17O has enhanced our understanding by offering new perspectives beyond those of δ18O, revealing insights into vapor sources and continental recycling. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of interannual triple oxygen isotope data, particularly in the Asian monsoon region. In this study, we analyzed the triple oxygen isotopes and hydrogen isotopes in monthly precipitation samples collected from Chongqing in Southwest China between 2019 and 2022 A.D. Seasonal variations in δD, δ18O, δ17O, and d‐excess values were observed, with lower values during the rainy season and higher values during the dry season, highlighting the impact of changes in moisture sources and local meteorological conditions on seasonal shifts in δD, δ18O, and δ17O. While, mean Δ′17O values were higher in rainy season and lower in dry season. Notably, during rainy season, there is a negative correlation between monthly Δ′17O values and the RH of the vapor source area, as well as a positive correlation with d‐excess. Recalculated Δ′17O values based on RH of oceanic moisture source, are higher than the measured values for this period, indicating the contribution of terrigenous moisture to precipitation in SW China. Precipitation Δ′17O values provide a more precise reflection of changes in moisture source, continental recycling, and evapotranspiration processes that drive water cycling compared Integrating modeling works in future will facilitate the use of precipitation Δ′17O values to quantify the impact of different moisture source on precipitation."

Efforts to quantify the occurrence, drivers, and severity of HABs across large areas is difficult due to the resource intensive nature of field monitoring of lake nutrient and chlorophyll‐a concentrations. To better characterize how nutrients interact with other environmental factors to produce algal blooms in freshwater systems, we used spatially explicit and temporally matched climate, landscape, in‐lake characteristic, and nutrient inventory data sets to predict nutrients and chlorophyll‐a across the conterminous US (CONUS). Using a nested modeling approach, three random forest (RF) models were trained to explain the spatiotemporal variation in total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll‐a concentrations across US EPA's National Lakes Assessment (n = 2,062). Concentrations of TN and TP were the most important predictors and, with other variables, the RF model accounted for 68% of variation in chlorophyll‐a. We then used these RF models to extrapolate lake TN and TP predictions to lakes without nutrient observations and predict chlorophyll‐a for ∼112,000 lakes across the CONUS. Risk for high chlorophyll‐a concentrations is highest in the agriculturally dominated Midwest, but other areas of risk emerge in nutrient pollution hot spots across the country. These catchment and lake‐specific results can help managers identify potential nutrient pollution and chlorophyll‐a hot spots that may fuel blooms, prioritize at‐risk lakes for additional monitoring, and optimize management to protect human health and other environmental end goals."

A 2021 moratorium on commercial fishing in the Arctic high seas provides a 16‐year runway for improved scientific understanding. Given substantial knowledge gaps, characterizing areas of highest uncertainty is a key first step. Marine ecosystem model ensembles that project future fish distributions could inform management of future Arctic fisheries, but Arctic‐specific variation has not yet been examined for global ensembles. We use the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Intercomparison Project ensemble driven by two Earth System Models (ESMs) under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1‐2.6 and SSP5‐8.5) to illustrate the current state of and uncertainty among biomass projections for the Arctic Ocean over the duration of the moratorium. The models generally project biomass increases in more northern Arctic ecosystems and decreases in southern ecosystems, but wide intra‐model variation exceeds projection means in most cases. The two ESMs show opposite trends for the main environmental drivers. Therefore, these projections are currently insufficient to inform policy actions. Investment in sustained monitoring and improving modeling capacity, especially for sea ice dynamics, is urgently needed. Concurrently, it will be necessary to develop frameworks for making precautionary decisions under continued uncertainty. We conclude that researchers should be transparent about uncertainty, presenting these model projections not as a source of scientific “answers,” but as bounding for plausible, policy‐relevant questions to assess trade‐offs and mitigate risks."

Despite local government's efforts to initiate coastal monitoring networks and qualitative risk guidelines, there remains a gap in detailed and efficient quantitative assessments for combinations of multiple sea‐level components. To address this, we develop the Tropical Cyclone Storm Surge‐based Flood Risk Assessment under Combined Scenarios (TCSoS‐FRACS). This framework integrates impacts of storm surges, high tides, and sea‐level rise using a hybrid of statistical and dynamic models to balance reliability and efficiency. By combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, it incorporates economic and demographic factors for a deeper understanding of risk composition. Applying TCSoS‐FRACS to Hainan Island reveals that the combined effects of storm surges, high tides, and sea‐level rise significantly amplify local coastal flood risk, increasing economic losses to 4.27–5.90 times and affected populations to 4.96–6.23 times. Additionally, transitioning from Fossil‐fueled Development (SSP5‐8.5) to Sustainability (SSP1‐1.9) can reduce the risk increase by approximately half. The equivalence in flood hazard between current high tides and future sea level under a sustainable scenario boosts confidence in climate change adaptation efforts. However, coastal cities with low hazard but high exposure need heightened vigilance in flood defense, as future risk could escalate sharply. Our study provides new insights into coastal flood risk on Hainan Island and other regions with similar profiles, offering a transferable and efficient tool for disaster risk management and aiding in regional sustainable development."

Ruby Leung,Impacts of Sea‐Level Rise on Coastal Groundwater Table Simulated by an Earth System Model With a Land‐Ocean Coupling Scheme,"Sea‐level rise (SLR) poses a severe threat to the coastal environment through seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers. The rising groundwater table also exacerbates the risk of pluvial, fluvial, and groundwater flooding in coastal regions. However, current Earth system models (ESMs) commonly ignore the exchanges of water at the land‐ocean interface. To address this gap, we developed a novel land‐ocean hydrologic coupling scheme in a state‐of‐the‐science ESM, the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2). The new scheme includes the lateral exchange between seawater and groundwater and the vertical infiltration of seawater driven by the SLR‐induced inundation. Simulations were performed with the updated E3SMv2 for the global land‐ocean interface to assess the impacts of SLR on coastal groundwater under a high CO2 emission scenario. By the middle of this century, seawater infiltration on the inundated areas will be the dominant component in the land‐ocean coupling process, while the lateral subsurface flow exchange will be much smaller. The SLR‐induced seawater infiltration will raise the groundwater levels, enhance evapotranspiration, and increase runoff with distinct spatial patterns globally in the future. Although the coupling process is induced by SLR, we found topography and warming temperature have more control on the coupling impacts, probably due to the relatively modest magnitude of SLR during the selected future period. Overall, our study suggests significant groundwater and seawater exchange at the land‐ocean interface, which needs to be considered in ESMs."

Evaluating these impacts is challenging due to the coarse spatial resolution of global climate models (GCMs); therefore, bias correction is widely used. Here, we applied two statistical methods—standard empirical quantile mapping (EQM) and a hybrid approach, EQM with linear correction (EQM‐LIN)—to bias correct precipitation and air temperature simulated by nine GCMs. We used historical observations from 20 weather stations across South Florida to project future climate under three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Compared to the EQM, the hybrid EQM‐LIN method improved R2 of daily quantiles by up to 30% over the historical period and improved MAE up to 70% in months that contain most extreme values. Projected extreme precipitation at the weather stations showed that, compared to the EQM‐LIN, the EQM method underestimates the high quantiles by up to 26% in SSP585. The projected changes in annual maximum precipitation from historical period (1985–2014) to near future (2040–2069) and far future (2070–2100) were between 2% and 16% across the study area. Projected future precipitation suggested a slight decrease during summer but an increase in fall. This, along with rising summer temperatures, suggested that South Florida can experience rapid oscillations from warmer summers and increased flooding in fall under future climate. Additionally, our comparative analyses with globally and nationally downscaled studies showed that such coarse scale studies do not represent the climatic extremes well, particularly for high quantile precipitation."

In this process, two pivotal decisions are (a) the Bias Correction Method (BCM) and (b) how to handle the historically observed time series, which can be used as a continuous whole (i.e., without dividing it into sub‐periods), or partitioned into monthly, seasonal (e.g., 3 months), or any other temporal stratification (TS). Here, we examine how the interplay between the choice of BCM, TS, and the raw GCM seasonality may affect historical portrayals and projected changes. To this end, we use outputs from 29 GCMs belonging to the CMIP6 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5–8.5 scenario, using seven BCMs and three TSs (entire period, seasonal, and monthly). The results show that the effectiveness of BCMs in removing biases can vary depending on the TS and climate indices analyzed. Further, the choice of BCM and TS may yield different projected change signals and seasonality (especially for precipitation), even for climate models with low bias and a reasonable representation of precipitation seasonality during a reference period. Because some BCMs may be computationally expensive, we recommend using the linear scaling method as a diagnostics tool to assess how the choice of TS may affect the projected precipitation seasonality of a specific GCM. More generally, the results presented here unveil trade‐offs in how BCMs are applied, regardless of the climate regime, urging the hydroclimate community to carefully implement these techniques."

However, the influence of forest management on forest productivity change and subsequent LULCC projections remains under‐investigated. This study explored the impacts of forest management‐induced change in forest productivity on LULCC throughout the 21st century. Specifically, we developed a framework to softly couple the Global Change Analysis Model and Global Timber Model to consider forest management‐induced forest productivity change and projected future LULCC across the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). We found future increases in forest management intensity overall drive the increase of forest productivity. The forest management‐induced forest productivity change shows diverse responses across all SSPs, with a global increase from 2015 to 2100 ranging from 3.9% (SSP3) to 8.8% (SSP1). This further leads to an overall decrease in the total area with a change of land use types, with the largest decrease under SSP1 (−7.5%) and the smallest decrease under SSP3 (−0.7%) in 2100. Among land use types, considering forest management‐induced change significantly reduces the expansion of managed forest and also reduces the loss of natural land in 2100 across SSPs. This suggests that ignoring forest management‐induced forest productivity change underestimates the efficiency of wood production, overestimates the managed forest expansion required to meet the future demand, and consequently, potentially introduces uncertainties into relevant analyses, for example, carbon cycle and biodiversity. Thus, we advocate to better account for the impacts of forest management in future LULCC projections."

Mapping and quantifying contemporary vertical land motion (VLM) at continental scales has long been a challenge due to the absence of gridded observational products covering these large domains. Here, we fill this gap by using the new European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) to assess the current state of coastal VLM in Europe. First, we compare the InSAR‐based EGMS Ortho (Level 3) with nearby global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) vertical velocity estimates and show that the geodetic reference frame used to calibrate EGMS strongly influences coastal vertical land velocity estimates at the millimeter per year level and this needs to be considered with caution. After adjusting the EGMS vertical velocity estimates to a more updated and accurate International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2014), we performed an assessment of VLM in European low elevation coastal flood plains (CFPs). We find that nearly half of the European CFP area is, on average, subsiding at a rate faster than 1 mm/yr. More importantly, we find that urban areas and populations located in the CFP experience a near −1 mm/yr VLM on average (excluding the uplifting Fennoscandia region). For harbors, the average VLM is even larger and increases to −1.5 mm/yr on average. This demonstrates the widespread importance of continental‐scale assessments based on InSAR and GNSS to better identify areas at higher risk from relative SLR due to coastal subsidence."

Therefore, exploring novel methods of increasing early warning capabilities is of vital importance to reducing food‐insecurity risk. We present a XGBoost machine‐learning model to predict food‐security crises up to 12 months in advance. We used >20 data sets and the FEWS IPC current‐situation estimates to train the machine‐learning model. Food‐security dynamics were captured effectively by the model up to 3 months in advance (R2 > 0.6). Specifically, we predicted 20% of crisis onsets in pastoral regions (n = 96) and 20%–50% of crisis onsets in agro‐pastoral regions (n = 22) with a 3‐month lead time. We also compared our 8‐month model predictions to the 8‐month food‐security outlooks produced by FEWS NET. Over a relatively short test period (2019–2022), results suggest the performance of our predictions is similar to FEWS NET for agro‐pastoral and pastoral regions. However, our model is clearly less skilled in predicting food security for crop‐farming regions than FEWS NET.

Excessive groundwater abstraction, sea‐level rise (SLR), land subsidence and other climate‐related factors are expected to accelerate this process in the future. The objective of this study is to (a) quantify the impact of projected climate change and (b) explore the role of individual hydrogeological boundaries on groundwater salinization of low‐lying coastal groundwater systems until 2100 CE. We employ numerical density‐dependent groundwater flow and salt transport modeling for this purpose, using Northwestern Germany as a case. Separate model variants are constructed and forced with climate data, that is, projected SLR and groundwater recharge, as well as likely ranges of other hydrogeological boundaries, including land subsidence, abstraction rates and drain levels. We find that autonomous salinization in the marsh areas, resulting from non‐equilibrium of the present‐day groundwater salinity distribution with current boundary conditions, is responsible for >50% of the salinization increase until 2100 CE. Sea‐level rise, land subsidence and drain levels are the other major factors controlling salinization. We further show that salinization of the water resources is a potential threat to coastal water users, including water suppliers and the agrarian sector, as well as coastal ecosystems. Regional‐scale uplifting of drain levels is identified as an efficient measure to mitigate salinization of deep and shallow groundwater in the future.

In this study, we analyze the water vapor circulation during the 2019 drought event using the land‐atmosphere water balance and a backward trajectory model for moisture tracking. Our results indicate that the precipitation in the M‐LMRB from May to October 2019 was only 71.9% of the long‐term climatological mean (1959–2021). The low precipitation during this drought event can be attributed to less‐than‐normal external water vapor supply. Specifically, the backward trajectory model reveals a decrease in the amount of water vapor transported from the Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal, and the Pacific Ocean, which are the main moisture sources for precipitation in the region. Comparing the atmospheric circulation patterns in 2019 with the climatology, we identify anomalous anticyclone conditions in the Bay of Bengal, anomalous westerlies in the Northeast Indian Ocean, and an anomalous cyclone in the Western Pacific Ocean, collectively facilitating a stronger export of water vapor from the region. Therefore, the dynamic processes played a more significant role than thermodynamic processes in contributing to the 2019 extreme drought event."

The event was accompanied by drier conditions driven by prolonged atmospheric blocking. During the heatwave, the maximum 6‐day means of humidex and temperature (HX‐6 and TX‐6) exhibited larger anomalies (6.70 and 5.57°C) compared to the 95th percentiles (HX95 and TX95) (4.12 and 3.73°C), relative to 1981–2021 extended summer (June‐September) averages. Extreme indices of humidex show faster and larger increases than those of temperature, reflecting the nonlinear positive relationship between humidex and temperature. Future projections from a multi‐model ensemble of 19 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase six (CMIP6) Global Climate Models (GCMs) clearly show an increase in humidex and temperature extremes, especially under intermediate and high emissions scenarios. Humidex indices (HX‐6 and HX95) show faster and larger increases than temperature indices (TX‐6 and TX95) for the same future years and global warming levels. Controlling for differences in GCM climate sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing yields robust projections at various global warming levels, reducing the ranges of projected changes from the multi‐model ensemble. At 3.0°C global warming from pre‐industrial, the multi‐model ensemble projects occurrences of HX‐6, TX‐6, HX95, and TX95 over WNA that exceed 2021 levels to occur every 3.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 2.2 years, respectively, increasing to almost annually at 4.0°C."

We focus on the Mekong River Basin, a fast‐developing region heavily relying on river‐derived ecosystem services. We employ a multi‐objective evolutionary algorithm to identify strategic dam portfolios for different hydropower expansion targets, using process‐related and statistical models to derive indicators of sediment supply disruption and GHG emissions. We introduce a robust optimization approach that explores variations in optimal portfolio compositions for more than 5,000 state‐of‐the‐world configurations, regarding sediment origins and trapping and GHG emissions. Thus, we can rank dam projects' attractiveness based on their frequency of inclusion in optimal portfolios and explore how uncertainty affects these rankings.

This study addresses this gap by conducting three comprehensive surveys in Dezhou, China—before, during, and after the first wave of social isolation (December 2019, March 2020, December 2020). These surveys assessed socioeconomic conditions, commuting habits, green space usage habits, and landscape preferences, specifically focusing on usage frequency, duration of stays, and activities undertaken. Using Mann‐Whitney U tests and Spearman's rho correlations, we identified significant long‐term changes, including an increase in the frequency of visits by previously infrequent users, a reduction in visit durations, and a rise in high‐intensity activities.

Human milk is a complex and dynamic mixture of endogenous and exogenous substances, including steroid hormones and PFAS. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between PFAS and steroid hormones in human milk from women living close to an e‐waste disassembly area. In 2021, we collected milk samples from 150 mothers within 4 weeks of delivery and analyzed them via liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry to determine the levels of 21 perfluorinated compounds and five steroid hormones (estrone, estriol, testosterone, progesterone, and androstenedione [A‐dione]). We also performed multiple linear regression analysis to clarify the association between maternal PFAS exposure and steroid hormone concentrations. Our results indicated that PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with estrone (β, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08–0.39) and A‐dione (β, 0.186; 95% CI, 0.016–0.357) concentrations in human milk, respectively.

Of concern, the PFAS intake of breastfeeding infants in the study area was higher than the recommended threshold.

As for other countries of Southern Europe, Spain is a region highly affected by heat and its increase under climate change. This is observed in the mean values and the increasing incidence of extreme weather events and associated mortality. Despite the vast knowledge on this topic, it remains unclear whether specific types and characteristics of HW are particularly harmful to the population and whether this shows a regional interdependency. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between HW characteristics and mortality in 12 Spanish cities. We used separated time series analysis in each city applying a quasi‐Poisson regression model and distributed lag linear and non‐linear models. Results show an increase in the mortality risk under HW conditions in the cities with a lower HW frequency. However, this increase exhibits remarkable differences across the cities under study not showing any general pattern in the HW characteristics‐mortality association. This relationship is shown to be complex and strongly dependent on the local properties of each city pointing out the crucial need to examine and understand on a local scale the HW characteristics and the HW‐mortality relationship for an efficient design and implementation of prevention measures."

 DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ) plays an essential role in replicating damaged DNA templates but contributes to mutagenesis due to its low fidelity. Therefore, ensuring tight control of Pol ζ’s activity is critical for continuous and accurate DNA replication, yet the specific mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals a regulation mechanism of Pol ζ activity in human cells. Under normal conditions, an autoinhibition mechanism keeps the catalytic subunit, REV3L, inactive. Upon encountering replication stress, however, ATR-mediated phosphorylation of REV3L’s S279 cluster activates REV3L and triggers its degradation via a caspase-mediated pathway. This regulation confines the activity of Pol ζ, balancing its essential role against its mutations causing potential during replication stress. Overall, our findings elucidate a control scheme that fine tunes the low-fidelity polymerase activity of Pol ζ under challenging replication scenarios.

Here, authors propose scCAD, a method that combines cluster decomposition and anomaly detection to effectively identify rare cell types across diverse biological scenarios. 
 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have become essential tools for characterizing cellular landscapes within complex tissues. Large-scale single-cell transcriptomics holds great potential for identifying rare cell types critical to the pathogenesis of diseases and biological processes. Existing methods for identifying rare cell types often rely on one-time clustering using partial or global gene expression. However, these rare cell types may be overlooked during the clustering phase, posing challenges for their accurate identification. In this paper, we propose a Cluster decomposition-based Anomaly Detection method (scCAD), which iteratively decomposes clusters based on the most differential signals in each cluster to effectively separate rare cell types and achieve accurate identification. We benchmark scCAD on 25 real-world scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods. In-depth case studies across diverse datasets, including mouse airway, brain, intestine, human pancreas, immunology data, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, showcase scCAD’s efficiency in identifying rare cell types in complex biological scenarios. Furthermore, scCAD can correct the annotation of rare cell types and identify immune cell subtypes associated with disease, thereby offering valuable insights into disease progression.

 Electrochemical organic synthesis is typically conducted in organic media. The solvent and related supporting electrolytes negatively affect the greenness of electrosynthesis. In this work, with 100% water used as the solvent, we realize aggregation-driven electrochemical radical cross coupling of unsaturated compounds driven by water tension. A key finding is that aggregation of the substrate at the electrode confined the radical intermediate and prevented side reactions, thus providing a way to regulate radical reactions in addition to their native properties. The reaction provides up to 90% yields with almost quantitative chemoselectivity. The pure water system readily yields the products via cold filtration, and the solvent is recycled repeatedly. In particular, the life span of the radical species generated in the reaction increase significantly because of the confined environment in the aggregation state.

 There are two main families of G protein-coupled receptors that detect odours in humans, the odorant receptors (ORs) and the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Their amino acid sequences are distinct, with the TAARs being most similar to the aminergic receptors such as those activated by adrenaline, serotonin, dopamine and histamine. To elucidate the structural determinants of ligand recognition by TAARs, we have determined the cryo-EM structure of a murine receptor, mTAAR7f, coupled to the heterotrimeric G protein Gs and bound to the odorant N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA) to an overall resolution of 2.9 Å. DMCHA is bound in a hydrophobic orthosteric binding site primarily through van der Waals interactions and a strong charge-charge interaction between the tertiary amine of the ligand and an aspartic acid residue. This site is distinct and non-overlapping with the binding site for the odorant propionate in the odorant receptor OR51E2. The structure, in combination with mutagenesis data and molecular dynamics simulations suggests that the activation of the receptor follows a similar pathway to that of the β-adrenoceptors, with the significant difference that DMCHA interacts directly with one of the main activation microswitch residues, Trp6.48.

While the dipole monsoon rainfall change between South Asia and Japan is related to the large-scale circulation adjustment in response to Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, the dipole oxygen isotope pattern is associated with the changing contribution of moisture sources.

 Reconstructing early human colonization of the Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean is challenging due to limited archaeological evidence. Current understanding places human arrival ~4400 years ago. Here, U-series data from phreatic overgrowth on speleothems are combined with the discovery of a submerged bridge in Genovesa Cave that exhibits a distinctive coloration band near its top. The band is at the same depth as the phreatic overgrowth on speleothems (−1.1 meters), both of which indicate a sea-level stillstand between ~6000 and ~5400 years ago. Integrating the bridge depth with a high-resolution Holocene sea-level curve for Mallorca and the dated phreatic overgrowth on speleothems level constrains the construction of the bridge between ~6000 and ~5600 years ago. Subsequent sea-level rise flooded the archeological structure, ruling out later construction dates. This provides evidence for early human presence on the island dating at least 5600 and possibly beyond ~6000 years ago.

 Global atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide have been increasing over previous decades with emerging research suggesting the Arctic as a notable contributor. Thermokarst processes, increasing temperature, and changes in drainage can cause degradation of polygonal tundra landscape features resulting in elevated, well-drained, unvegetated soil surfaces that exhibit large nitrous oxide emissions. Here, we outline the magnitude and some of the dominant factors controlling variability in emissions for these thermokarst landscape features in the North Slope of Alaska. We measured strong nitrous oxide emissions during the growing season from unvegetated high centered polygons (median (mean) = 104.7 (187.7) µg N2O-N m−2 h−1), substantially higher than mean rates associated with Arctic tundra wetlands and of similar magnitude to unvegetated hotspots in peat plateaus and palsa mires. In the absence of vegetation, isotopic enrichment of 15N in these thermokarst features indicates a greater influence of microbial processes, (denitrification and nitrification) from barren soil. Findings reveal that the thermokarst features discussed here (~1.5% of the study area) are likely a notable source of nitrous oxide emissions, as inferred from chamber-based estimates. Growing season emissions, estimated at 16 (28) mg N2O-N ha−1 h−1, may be large enough to affect landscape-level greenhouse gas budgets.

 Predicting heavy precipitation remains scientifically challenging. Here we combine Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) temperature and moisture soundings and weather forecast winds to predict the formation of thermodynamic conditions favourable for convection in the hours following satellite overpasses. Here we treat AIRS retrievals as air parcels that are moved adiabatically to generate time-varying fields. Over much of the Central-Eastern Continental U.S. during the non-winter months of 2019–2020, our derived convective available potential energy alone predicts intense precipitation. For hourly precipitation above the all-hours 99.9th percentile, performance is marginally lower than forecasts from a convection permitting model, but similar to the ERA5 reanalysis and substantially better than using the original AIRS soundings. Our results illustrate how mesoscale advection is a major contributor to developing heavy precipitation in the region. Enhancing the full AIRS record as described here would provide an alternative approach to quantify multi-decade trends in heavy precipitation risk.

 Photovoltaic (PV) panel deployment for decarbonization may reduce local terrestrial albedo, triggering a positive radiative forcing that counteracts the desired negative radiative forcing from carbon emission reductions. Yet, this potential adverse impact remains uncertain due to limited observations at PV sites. Herein we employ a robust linear parameterization method to quantify PV-induced albedo changes based on satellite data globally. We find an overall albedo decrease of −1.28 (−1.80, −0.90) × 10−2 (median and interquartile range), specific for land-cover types and climate regimes. However, the extent of albedo reduction is markedly lower than simplistic assumed values in simulating climate feedback for solar farming in Earth system models. Moreover, the albedo-induced positive radiative forcing can be offset by negative radiative forcing from clean solar generation in most PV farms within one year. Our findings underscore PV’s potential in mitigating global warming and stress the need for more accurate model estimations.

We found an expansion in climate suitability in North America, East Asia and the Mediterranean basin, where with few exceptions, endemicity is not yet established.

 Branch architecture provides crucial information for the understanding of plant trait variability and the adaptive strategies employed by trees in response to their environment. High-fidelity terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data provide an accurate, efficient, and non-destructive means for constructing three-dimensional (3D) tree models and estimating architectural traits. However, the complex canopy structure of trees in natural forests and the presence of occlusion in TLS data pose significant challenges to achieving this goal. In this study, we present a novel algorithm, L1-Tree, for the construction of 3D tree models and the estimation of architectural traits from TLS data. This algorithm is grounded in the L1-Median algorithm and integrates a tree skeleton optimization procedure that considers the structural characteristics of tree branches. By comparing modeling results and manually derived branch traits for 24 trees of 24 species, we found that the L1-Tree algorithm achieved precision, recall, and F-score values of 0.94 for branch identification, coefficient of determination, root-mean-squared error, and normalized root-mean-squared error of 0.998, 0.068 m, and 0.3 % for branch length estimation, and a respective value of 0.958, 0.257 cm and 0.9 % for branch radius estimation. Additionally, the branch identification accuracy and accuracy in branch architectural trait estimation remained satisfactory across branch orders. Compared to established 3D tree model construction algorithms (e.g., TreeQSM), our L1-Tree algorithm demonstrated a superior capability in handling noisy environments and data gaps, making it a robust tool for TLS data-based tree architecture studies. Leaf-wood separation emerged as a crucial step influencing the performance of the L1-Tree algorithm. We observed significant drop in branch identification accuracy when using an automatic leaf-wood separation algorithm as input, highlighting the urgent need to develop effective leaf-wood separation algorithms to generate high-quality wood point clouds for tree architecture studies."

 For over four decades, spaceborne multispectral data have played a crucial role in supporting mineral exploration and geologic mapping. The spaceborne multispectral datasets, however, have a restricted number of bands with coarse spectral resolution and, thus are very limited in mineral mapping. The advent of high-quality spaceborne imaging spectroscopic data like the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), has bridged this gap initiating a new era in global hyperspectral mineral mapping. The EnMAP satellite, operational since November 2022, covers the spectral range of 420 and 2450 nm in 224 bands, offering a spatial resolution of 30 m and a mean spectral sampling distance of 8.1 and 12.5 nm in the visible-near infrared and shortwave infrared regions, respectively. In this paper, we demonstrate the enhanced mapping capabilities of EnMAP using datasets acquired over the Reko Diq mining district, a cluster of Miocene porphyries located in Pakistan's Chagai Belt hosting an undeveloped world-class porphyry Cu-Au ± Mo deposit. The EnMAP's Level 2A data product was processed using the polynomial fitting technique to characterize the diagnostic absorption features of the alteration minerals in the Reko Diq porphyry system. This involved retrieving the minimum wavelength, depth, width, and asymmetry parameters for key absorption features and employing them interactively for mineral characterization. A diverse array of minerals were successfully mapped over the study area and validated by ground spectroscopy. This includes abundance/composition maps for white micas, chlorite, epidote, calcite, kaolinite, gypsum, jarosite, and ferric and ferrous iron minerals. The minimum wavelength of white mica was found to vary between 2195 and 2210 nm, with the shorter wavelengths (Al-rich) white mica occurring proximal to the known mineralized zones. The potassic alteration cores and the outer propylitic zones were identified by the ferrous iron and chlorite-epidote-calcite mineral maps, respectively. This study demonstrated the superiority of EnMAP hyperspectral data in delineating the alteration mineralogy and zonation pattern of porphyry copper systems.

 Extracting buildings from True Digital Ortho Maps often encounters occlusions and misidentifications, making it challenging to obtain complete, regular, and accurate building contours. To address this issue, we developed a building recognition process based on the Segment Anything Model, and proposed a novel regularization algorithm for building contour inference and fitting, which quantifies the confidence levels of contour points to accurately fit building contours from data containing substantial noise, and reformulates the fitting problem as progressive node classification tasks consisting of contour simplification, iterative regularization, and rationality assessment. In experimental evaluations, the proposed contour fitting algorithm achieved 97.99 % Intersection over Union (IoU), 95.39 % consistency with the standard contour edge count, and 88.06 % of cases with Hausdorff distances less than or equal to 15 pixels (30 cm), significantly outperforming comparative methods. Notably, it was the only contour regularization algorithm that improved IoU (1.03 %) compared to the original contours. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively suppresses noise and infers incomplete building contours, producing accurate and regular contours comparable to manual delineation. It is particularly suitable for buildings with near-orthogonal structures, exhibiting significant practical applicability and generalization potential."

 Reservoir landslides in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China, exhibit prolonged slow motion and the potential for catastrophic events due to fluctuations in reservoir levels and intense rainfall episodes. Their distinct step-like deformation characteristics, involving rapid transformation processes of different states, pose challenges for accurate early warning and prediction. Previous forecasting models have often struggled with limited accuracy. This study introduces a mechanism-assisted deep learning model, leveraging the Informer architecture, to predict prolonged step-like reservoir landslide displacement. Utilizing a 15-year continuous monitoring dataset of the Baishuihe landslide, this model investigates the landslide mechanism, identifies influencing conditions underlying the step-wise behavior, and customizes input features for the prediction model by integrating optimized variational mode decomposition and wavelet analysis. Additionally, the dynamic correlation and hysteresis analysis between triggering factors and displacement offer valuable physical insights into the model and enhance the interpretability of the model. The model is further tailored to accommodate features of the monitoring dataset associated with landslide evolution by integrating a global multi-head attention mechanism and pooling layers, enabling the capture of both globe dependencies and local critical features of the model inputs. Through rigorous model training, performance evaluation, and tuning, the proposed model efficiently predicts step-wise landslide displacement, particularly during short-term rapid transitions between creep-mutation states."

However, it is challenging to distinguish bacterial anionic phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) from mammalian anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) with the same net charge. Here, we report a class of radially amphiphilic α helix antimicrobial peptides (RAPs) that can selectively discriminate PG from PS, relying on the helix structure. The representative RAP, L10-MMBen, can direct the rearrangement of PG vesicles into a lamellar structure with its helix axis parallel to the PG membrane surface. The helical structure imparts both the thermodynamic and kinetic advantages of L10-MMBen/PG assembly, and the hiding of hydrophobic regions in RAPs is crucial for PG recognition. L10-MMBen exhibits high selectivity against bacteria depending on PG recognition, showing low in vivo toxicity and significant treatment efficacy in mice infection models. Our study introduces a helicity-direct bacterial phospholipid recognition paradigm for designing highly selective antimicrobial peptides."

These challenges restrain chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell efficacy, underlining the importance of armoring. In solid cancers, a localized tumor mass allows alternative administration routes, such as intratumoral delivery with the potential to improve efficacy and safety but may compromise metastatic-site treatment. Using a multi-layered CAR T cell engineering strategy that allowed a synergy between attributes, we show enhanced cytotoxic activity of MUC1 CAR T cells armored with PD1KO, tumor-specific interleukin-12 release, and TGFBR2KOattributes catered towards the TNBC TME. Intratumoral treatment effectively reduced distant tumors, suggesting retention of antigen-recognition benefits at metastatic sites. Overall, we provide preclinical evidence of armored non-alloreactive MUC1 CAR T cells greatly reducing high TNBC tumor burden in a TGFB1- and PD-L1–rich TME both at local and distant sites while preserving safety."

Unlike nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), commonly performed at high magnetic fields and under MAS to maximize sensitivity and resolution, EPR is usually measured at low magnetic fields and, with the exception of the Spiess group work in the late 1990s, never under MAS, due to great instrumentational challenges.

However, the connection between SSEs and earthquake hazard has been difficult to quantify and contextualize beyond regional studies. We aggregate a geodetic record of SSEs from subduction zones in the circum-Pacific region. In aggregate, earthquake rates increase up to threefold concurrent with and proximal to SSEs. The relative amplitude of this increase is correlated with the SSE size and, to a lesser extent, their depth and region. The subdued and coincident earthquake response to SSE stress transfer suggests a more limited role of static stress transfer and a very short relaxation timescale for the triggered seismicity. The observed range of behavior does not support a major connection between SSEs and earthquake hazard."

Here, we investigate the potential of amylum (starch) not only to self-assemble into hierarchical fibrillar structures but also to exhibit canonical amyloidogenic properties. Ordered amylum structures were formed through a sigmoidal growth process with characteristic amyloid features including typical nanofibril morphology, binding to indicative dyes, inherent luminescence, apple-green birefringence upon Congo red staining, and notable mechanical rigidity.

Here, using a synthetic diet, we perform a systematic investigation of the effect of single NEAA deprivation on nutrient-sensing pathways, reproductive ability, starvation resistance, feeding behavior, and life span in adult female flies. Specifically, dietary tyrosine deprivation decreases internal tyrosine levels and fecundity, influences AA-sensing machineries, and extends life span. These nutritional responses are not observed under higher total AA intake or in infertile female flies, suggesting a context-dependent influence of dietary tyrosine. Our findings highlight the unique role of tyrosine as a potentially limiting nutrient, underscoring its value for dietary interventions aimed at enhancing health span."

Yet, parent-offspring conflict theory predicts that offspring might also rely on alternative cues to adjust demand in response to prenatal cues of parental capacity for resource provisioning. Here, we show how embryonic experience with vocalizations carried out by parents during nest-relief displays at incubation adaptively shapes avian offspring development, providing lasting benefits to offspring. Genetic siblings prenatally exposed to different levels of parent-parent communication showed differences in epigenetic patterns, adrenocortical responsiveness, development, and food solicitation behavior. The correspondence between prenatal acoustic experience and parental context positively influenced the nutritional status and growth rate of offspring reared by communicative parents. Offspring can thus retain strong control over their own development by gathering prenatal acoustic information about parental generosity."

Quantitative benchmarking was achieved establishing high-fidelity monomer and dimer controls. While CD95 alone is primarily monomeric (~96%) and dimeric (4%), the addition of ligand induces oligomerization to dimers/trimers (~15%) leading to cell death.

However, their practical adoption is hindered by their subpar image quality compared to two-dimensional displays, which is fundamentally limited by restricted spatial frequency bandwidth and artifacts. We address the limitation by using a symmetry-broken amplitude-only spatial light modulator, demonstrating image quality comparable to that of two-dimensional displays. The broken conjugate symmetry induced by phase noise of modulators eliminates conjugate image that causes issues in amplitude-only holograms and allows direct reconstruction without additional optical elements. The proposed method provides enhanced robustness against artifacts caused by sub-pixel structures of modulators, enabling experimental reconstruction of high-quality holograms. The full bandwidth and the robustness result in a 5-decibel improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to state-of-the-art holograms. Furthermore, the hologram has 24 times higher optical efficiency and a smaller volume than the traditional amplitude-only holograms while real-time synthesis is enabled by using a neural network."

This system turns on fast, is reversible in minutes or hours, and contains variants optimized for neurons and epithelial cells. By using OptoTrap to disrupt microtubules and inhibit kinesin-1 in neurons, we show that microtubules support the growth of highly dynamic dendrites and that kinesin-1 is required for patterning of low- and high-order dendritic branches in differential spatiotemporal domains.
