10.5194/amt-18-5087-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文介绍了一种新型的无壁粒子蒸发器（WALL-E），并将其与化学电离质谱仪（CIMS）联用，用于实时在线测量大气颗粒物。该系统能够对气溶胶的成分、定量和挥发性分布进行分子水平的分析，同时最大限度地减少壁面相互作用和碎片化。研究重点在于有机气溶胶的表征，这与大气成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关。虽然论文没有直接涉及卫星观测或遥感技术，但其对气溶胶性质的深入研究为理解大气过程和改进空气质量模型提供了重要数据，这些模型常与遥感数据结合使用。,"['atmospheric aerosols', 'organic aerosols', 'aerosol composition', 'volatility', 'air quality monitoring']",Linyu Gao;Imad Zgheib;Evangelos Stergiou;Cecilie Carstens;Félix Sari Doré;Michel Dupanloup;Frederic Bourgain;Sébastien Perrier;Matthieu Riva,Characterization of the newly designed wall-free particle evaporator (WALL-E) for online measurements of atmospheric particles,"In this work, we introduce WALL-E, a newly designed wall-free particle evaporator that enables real-time online aerosol analyses while minimizing wall interactions and fragmentation, offering a more accurate and efficient approach to studying aerosol properties. WALL-E provides molecular-level insights into aerosol composition, quantification, and volatility distributions. 
 Organic aerosols (OAs) play a critical role in the atmosphere by directly altering human health and the climate. Understanding the formation and evolution of OAs as well as their physicochemical properties requires a detailed characterization of their chemical composition. Despite advanced analytical techniques developed within the last decades, the real-time online measurement of atmospheric particles remains challenging and is affected by different artifacts (i.e., thermal decomposition, fragmentation, wall loss). In this work, we introduce the newly designed wall-free particle evaporator (WALL-E) coupled with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS), using bromide (Br−) as the reagent ion. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of the WALL-E system, demonstrating its ability to evaporate particles while maintaining the integrity of the compounds composing the particles (i.e., minimal thermal decomposition). To demonstrate WALL-E's performance, the composition of aerosol particles formed from α-pinene ozonolysis in the presence of SO2 is characterized. In addition, by applying the scan declustering method, we can now provide a quantification of the different species present in the condensed phase, e.g., C10H16O4 84 ng m−3, C19H28O7 7 ng m−3 for a total secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass of 1 µg m−3. While dimers exhibit higher sensitivities, they account for only 14 %–18 % of the total particle mass, which is considerably lower than their signal fractions (23 %–29 %). This suggests a potential overestimation of the dimer contributions when relying solely on signal fractions. In addition, a volatility analysis using thermograms reveals a clear relationship between T50 and compound saturation vapor pressure (C∗), with lower-volatility species desorbing at higher temperatures. In addition, the measured T50 (the temperature at which 50 % of a compound evaporates) for α-pinene-derived SOA products agree well with theoretical volatility estimation models (e.g., SIMPOL). Overall, this study demonstrates that the WALL-E system coupled with a CIMS is a promising technique for real-time particle characterization (i.e., composition, quantification, and volatility) of atmospheric aerosols."

We present detailed information on the data and metadata availability for the Naypyitaw station (NPW) in Myanmar, the only local strong-motion station located near the Sagaing Fault that recorded the mainshock without saturation. We also highlight the collaborative effort that made the installation of NPW possible. The high-quality recordings from NPW offer critical insights for seismic hazard assessment in the region. 
 We present an overview of the Naypyitaw station (NPW) in Myanmar, which is managed by the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) and is part of the GEOFON (GE) network (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15921214, Bindi et al., 2025). The station is equipped with both strong-motion and broadband sensors and is situated 2.6 km from the Sagaing Fault, providing an exceptional near-fault recording of the Mw 7.7 earthquake that occurred on 28 March 2025. The installation and ongoing maintenance of NPW are the result of a collaborative effort between DMH and the GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), prompted by the GFZ International Training Course on seismology and seismic hazard assessment (ITC) in 2016. In this study, we provide background information on the collaborative effort that led to the installation of the only station providing near-fault, on-scale measurements of the 2025 Myanmar earthquake. Given the widespread interest in the data recorded by the station, we describe the instrumental settings in detail and how to access data and metadata for station NPW. Given the relevance of the near-fault recordings at NPW not only for constraining the rupture process of the mainshock but also for engineering seismology applications, we analyze key features of the mainshock from an engineering seismology perspective. This includes an examination of ground motion amplitudes, frequency content, response spectra, and near-fault effects such as the fling effect and pulse-like motion. The high-quality near-field data at NPW provide valuable information for seismic hazard assessment in the region and offer useful constraints for studies investigating the rupture characteristics of the mainshock, which preliminary findings suggest propagated at supershear speed."

Using satellite data and deep learning, it fills missing observations and delivers continuous estimates. Tests against in situ measurements show it is closer to reality and more reliable than existing products. This open resource supports improved climate studies and model evaluation. 
 Air–sea turbulent heat fluxes – latent heat flux (LHF) and sensible heat flux (SHF) – are fundamental to the Earth’s energy and moisture budgets and to ocean–atmosphere coupling. Global flux estimates via bulk aerodynamic algorithms depend on sea surface temperature (SST), surface wind speed (SSW), near-surface air temperature (Ta), and specific humidity (Qa), but orbital sampling and cloud contamination leave gaps in satellite inputs that propagate uncertainty to Ta/Qa and hence to LHF/SHF. Here we present DeepFlux, a global daily 1° × 1° heat-flux dataset for 29 years (January 1992–December 2020). The dataset is produced with a concise completion-then-retrieval workflow: Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) variables (SSW, cloud liquid water, total column water vapor, and rain rate) are first gap-filled using the AI-based Generalized Data Completion Model (GDCM) to yield spatiotemporally continuous inputs; these – together with Optimum Interpolation SST (OISST) – are then used to retrieve Ta and Qa via the AI-based Matrices-Points Fusion Network (MPFNet). LHF and SHF are then computed using a bulk algorithm. Validation against in-situ buoy observations shows that the dataset closely matches the true measurements, with RMSEs of 0.53 °C (Ta), 0.70 g kg⁻¹ (Qa), 5.53 W m⁻² (SHF), and 25.28 W m⁻² (LHF). Comparisons with widely used flux products indicate differences among products, reflecting variability in flux estimates from different sources. DeepFlux provides an open, consistent, observation-constrained view of near-surface meteorology and air–sea heat exchange for climate diagnostics, model evaluation, and process studies.

The spectral detail enables precise identification of UV absorption characteristics and atmospheric interactions previously obscured in conventional broadband measurements. These results provide new capabilities for monitoring ozone depletion, and optimizing solar energy systems across China's diverse climatic regions. 
 Solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) plays a fundamental role in the Earth’s energy balance, influencing a wide range of processes, including material degradation, biophysical reactions, ecological dynamics, or public health. In this context, the first high-resolution (10×10 km) hourly dataset of surface solar UV under clear-sky conditions over mainland China from 1981 to 2023 is introduced, derived from ERA5 and MERRA2 reanalysis data and a reconstruction based on the SMARTS (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine) spectral model. Leveraging the SMARTS model’s accuracy and capabilities, this dataset provides UV data at 0.5 nm intervals between 280 nm and 400 nm, offering enhanced granularity for wavelength-specific analysis, thus filling a key gap in high-resolution hourly UV data for China. Validation of the UV dataset against ground observations at 37 stations of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) demonstrates strong performance, with a correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias error (MBE) of 0.919, 5.07 W m-2 and −0.07 W m-2, respectively. Compared with the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) UV product, this dataset offers higher spatial and temporal resolution as well as higher accuracy in comparison with observations, thus enhancing data quality for a wide range of applications. The spatial and temporal distribution of clear-sky UV radiation exhibits distinct regional and seasonal variations, with higher values in the west and south, and lower values in the east and north. Over the past 43 years, the annual mean clear-sky broadband UV radiation averaged over China was 20.05 W m⁻², showing a slightly increasing trend (+0.0237 W m⁻²yr⁻¹). This dataset is now available at https://cjgeodata.cug.edu.cn/#/pageDetail?id=110 or https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28234298, offering a valuable resource for addressing regional challenges related to UV radiation."

Wulder,Airborne laser scanning transects over Canada's northern forests: lidar plots for science and application,"We describe a new dataset derived from airborne laser transects collected across northern Canada. ALS transects bridge the gap between ground measurements and satellite mapping, providing a powerful new resource to understand, monitor, and manage northern forests. The lidar plots and point cloud metrics described form part of an open-data initiative to enhance structural information. This dataset supports key applications in forest inventory, wildfire risk assessment, and ecosystem monitoring. 
 Mapping vegetation is required for monitoring the condition of forest resources. Satellite data provide information on land cover and change; however, forest structural attributes are difficult to model without additional measurements from ground plots or airborne laser scanning (ALS, also known as airborne light detection and ranging or lidar) instruments. Over large and inaccessible areas, such as Canada's northern and predominantly unmanaged forests, ground plots are expensive, difficult to install, and unlikely to form a statistically valid probability sample. An alternative means to obtain information regarding forest structure in these situations is samples of ALS (hereafter lidar plots). Transect-based samples of ALS data can be used to provide structural information for the calibration and validation of spatially explicit predictive modelling for wide-area mapping of forest attributes. Here we describe and share data from the recent acquisition and processing of ALS transects across Canada's northern forests. To date, approximately 43,000 km of ALS transects have been acquired in 2023 and 2024, with additional coverage ongoing for 2025. Acquisition flight lines were designed to sample a range of northern forest conditions and to correspond with a concurrent ground plot sampling campaign. Airborne laser scanning data were processed into height-normalized point clouds and reprojected to a custom Lambert conformal conic projection to align with existing national satellite information products. More than 15 million 900 m2 lidar plots were generated from the 2023 transect dataset with point cloud metrics (i.e., area-based statistical summaries of the ALS point cloud) calculated for each 30 by 30 m cell. Presently, the 2023 lidar plots and their associated point cloud metrics are stored in openly available SQLite GeoPackages, with additional annual transect collections to be added when available. To accommodate a wide range of users and applications, both comprehensive and abridged versions of the metric databases, with 369 metrics and 40 metrics, respectively, are shared. The framework that led to the data shared here is portable to other areas with similar information needs. The data structure used was designed to enable updates with additional open access databases of ALS transects as data acquisition and processing are completed. This open-access dataset constitutes a vital resource for the scientific and operational forestry communities, offering detailed and scalable measures that bridge the gap between ground observations and wall-to-wall satellite-based inventories. These data will support the development of enhanced wildfire fuels maps, forest inventories, and carbon products."

In response to this challenge, our new 2003–2023 dataset integrates top-down and bottom-up methods with multi-source data. This provides a plausible emissions range to quantify uncertainty, revealing that the greatest uncertainty is not in traditional hotspots but in regions with infrequent, extreme fires. This work offers vital data for more robust climate models. 
 Against the backdrop of global climate change, the spatiotemporal patterns of biomass burning are undergoing significant changes. However, large discrepancies among different emission inventories hinder a consensus on the true magnitude and long-term trends of global emissions. This study constructs a framework for estimating biomass burning emissions by integrating bottom-up and top-down approaches with various combinations of multi-source data inputs, resulting in the development of the Multi-ensemble Biomass-burning Emissions Inventory (MBEI). Leveraging this framework, we develop the MBEI global emission dataset covering the period 2003–2023, which comprises eight sub-inventories and provides emission estimates for 11 representative greenhouse gases, aerosols, and atmospheric pollutants, including CO2, PM2.5, BC, NO2, and others. A unique feature of MBEI is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in biomass burning emission estimates across various spatial scales, achieved by calculating the average emissions and their Max-Min band at a 0.1° grid scale from these sub-inventories. The analysis reveals that the global annual CO2 emissions from biomass burning are approximately 7304 (4400–9657) Tg, with the maximum value being more than double the minimum. Furthermore, the uncertainty in global biomass burning emissions exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity: in low-emission regions such as Australia and the Middle East, the ratio of maximum to minimum emission estimates can reach 6–7 fold, whereas in traditional hotspots like Africa and South America, this ratio is lower, around 1.9 fold. In terms of temporal trends, global emissions showed a decreasing trend from 2003 to 2013, primarily driven by a reduction in burning activities in tropical regions. This trend, however, reversed to an increase from 2013 to 2023, with the primary drivers being intensified burning in northern high-latitude regions and the frequent occurrence of extreme events. Finally, a comparison with existing inventories confirms the reliability of the MBEI dataset. At both global and regional scales, the average of our inventory is centrally positioned among other inventory estimates in most years, offering a more robust central estimate for assessing biomass burning emission intensity during extreme event years. Moreover, its maximum-minimum range encompasses the estimates of other inventories across most regions and time periods. This capability to characterize uncertainty enables the integration of the new datasets MBEI into analytical frameworks, such as atmospheric chemistry models and exposure risk assessments, thereby enhancing the reliability of global biomass burning dynamics analyses and the robustness of the conclusions.

Here, we use coupled land‐atmosphere model simulations to quantitatively assess the effects of vegetation greening on summer mean and extreme land surface temperatures in Eastern China over the 2003–2018 period. We show that the modeled cooling effect on summer mean land surface temperature is more pronounced in arid Northeastern China than in humid Southeastern China, consistent with satellite‐derived temperature responses. In contrast, for extreme hot temperatures, the spatial pattern of the cooling effect reverses, largely because high temperatures accompanied by strong radiation can alleviate energy constraints on evaporative cooling in Southeastern China. These findings underscore the potential role of vegetation greening in mitigating extreme hot extremes, with important implications for local land‐based mitigation and adaptation strategies."

In the rate‐and‐state friction framework, we observed that fine‐grained gouge is strongly velocity‐weakening over a substantially broader range in temperature than coarse‐grained gouge at V of 1–100 μm/s. Velocity‐weakening may result from a combination of mechanical comminution (grain size reduction) and dilatant granular (i.e., cataclastic) flow, operating in competition with compaction and creep involving grain scale mass transfer by pressure solution.

We find notable underestimation of drought severity and coverage by GWMs, across diverse regions, including North America, South America, Africa, and Northern Asia. When examined without trend removal, the underestimation of TWS droughts is more pronounced in recent years (2016–2019) compared to 2002–2015, especially in northern latitudes.

This method reveals seasonal trends that are obscured using approaches from previous literature. We also examine how ratio variations correspond to changing wind conditions, facilitating more granular spatial emissions attribution. Comparisons with CO and CO2 from the publicly available GRA2PES inventory reveal that the CO:CO2 inventory ratios align well with observations, supporting the inventory's methodology. In contrast, comparisons with the GRA2PES CH4 inventory beta, which is still under development, indicate that it does not adequately capture the spatial distribution of CH4 sources in the SLV, highlighting areas for improvement.

This study examines a 19‐year mean of cloud properties and top‐of‐the‐atmosphere (TOA) cloud radiative effects (CREs) by cloud type, with a focus on regional variations across convectively active tropical regions. Forty‐two cloud types are classified based on effective cloud‐top pressure and cloud optical depth. The analysis reveals distinct regional differences in cloud occurrence and properties, with oceanic regions dominated by convective anvils and boundary‐layer clouds, which have higher liquid/ice water contents, while land regions feature higher fractions of mid‐level clouds with lower liquid/ice water contents. The study further explores shortwave (SW), longwave (LW), and net CREs, decomposing the contributions of individual cloud types to total CRE differences between two regions into three components: CRE deviations within a cloud type, cloud fraction (CF) deviations, and their combined effect. Results show that CF deviations have the largest impact, enhancing LW warming and SW cooling for mid‐ and high‐level clouds while reducing SW and net cooling for low‐level clouds. Although the effects of CRE deviations are smaller than those of CF deviations for individual cloud types, its collective contribution to total regional CRE differences, particularly for net CRE, is more comparable, because the former exhibits consistent regional differences across all cloud types while the latter is influenced by opposing effects between low‐ and high‐level clouds.

Freunberger,Marcus kinetics control singlet and triplet oxygen evolving from superoxide,"The release of triplet or singlet oxygen is governed by individual Marcus normal and inverted region behaviour. 
 Oxygen redox chemistry is central to life1 and many human-made technologies, such as in energy storage2–4. The large energy gain from oxygen redox reactions is often connected with the occurrence of harmful reactive oxygen species3,5,6. Key species are superoxide and the highly reactive singlet oxygen3–7, which may evolve from superoxide. However, the factors determining the formation of singlet oxygen, rather than the relatively unreactive triplet oxygen, are unknown. Here we report that the release of triplet or singlet oxygen is governed by individual Marcus normal and inverted region behaviour. We found that as the driving force for the reaction increases, the initially dominant evolution of triplet oxygen slows down, and singlet oxygen evolution becomes predominant with higher maximum kinetics. This behaviour also applies to the widely observed superoxide disproportionation, in which one superoxide is oxidized by another, in both non-aqueous and aqueous systems, with Lewis and Brønsted acidity controlling the driving forces. Singlet oxygen yields governed by these conditions are relevant, for example, in batteries or cellular organelles in which superoxide forms. Our findings suggest ways to understand and control spin states and kinetics in oxygen redox chemistry, with implications for fields, including life sciences, pure chemistry and energy storage. The release of triplet or singlet oxygen is governed by individual Marcus normal and inverted region behaviour."

 Nitrogen (N) assimilation consumes carbon (C) in plants, and climate warming can alter soil N availability, thereby affecting plant N assimilation and associated C costs. However, the global C cost of N assimilation in terrestrial plants has long been unconstrained, and its warming response remains uncertain. Here we constructed a modelling framework of plant C costs for nitrate, ammonium and extractable organic N assimilation and assessed global C costs of plant N assimilation. Globally, the C costs for plant N assimilation were 208 ± 12 and 249 ± 15 TgC yr−1 under the present-day and 2.0 °C warming scenarios, respectively, which exceed the C emissions caused by deforestation and degradation fires and are comparable to the forest C fixed by atmospheric N deposition. Under the warming scenario, the global C cost would increase by 47% (41 ± 19 TgC yr−1), with a greater percentage increase at higher latitudes, due partly to enhanced contributions and C cost of soil inorganic N. We conclude that the C cost for N assimilation in terrestrial plants should be incorporated into global C budgets, while its positive response to warming would improve predictions of terrestrial C-cycle feedbacks to global warming.

However, the nAb correlate was weaker and shorter-lived in a vaccine-immunity versus hybrid-immunity population. 
 People with HIV (PWH) are understudied in COVID-19 vaccine trials, leaving knowledge gaps on whether the identified immune correlates of protection also hold in PWH. CoVPN 3008 (NCT05168813) enrolled predominantly PWH and reported lower COVID-19 incidence for a Hybrid vs. Vaccine Group (baseline SARS-CoV-2-positive and one mRNA-1273 dose vs. negative and two doses). Using case-cohort sampling, antibody markers at enrolment (M0) and four weeks post-final vaccination (Peak) are assessed as immune correlates of COVID-19. For the Hybrid Group [n = 287 (195 PWH)], all M0 markers inversely correlate with COVID-19 through 230 days post-Peak, with 50% inhibitory dilution BA.4/5 neutralizing antibody titer (nAb-ID50 BA.4/5) the strongest and only independent correlate (HR per 10-fold increase=0.46, 95% CI 0.28, 0.75; P = 0.002). For the Vaccine Group [n = 115 (86 PWH)], Peak nAb-ID50 BA.4/5 correlates with reduced COVID-19 risk (1.9%, 1.1%, and 0.3% at titers 10, 100, and 1000 AU/ml) through 92, but not 165, days post-Peak. Using multivariable Cox analysis of binding and nAb, nAb titers predict COVID-19 in PWH. Two doses of a 100-µg Ancestral strain mRNA vaccine in baseline-SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals elicit sufficient cross-reacting Omicron antibodies to reduce COVID-19 incidence for 90 days post-Peak, but viral evolution and waning antibodies abrogate this protection thereafter.

 Transition metal oxides with partially filled d orbitals serve as effective polysulfide conversion catalysts in lithium-sulfur batteries. Nonetheless, a predictive descriptor to elucidate their structure-activity relationship is still lacking. To fill this gap, here we investigate the occupancy of t2 orbitals as a possible descriptor for the polysulfide conversion activity of spinel oxides. The electrochemical characterizations reveal a volcano relationship between t2 occupancy and the polysulfide conversion activity of spinel oxides. The theoretical calculations indicate that the t2 occupancy effect is associated with the ability of tetrahedral cations to cleave S-S bonds and form Li-S bonds. As such, Mn0.5Co0.5Cr2O4, with an optimized average t2 occupancy of 2.88, is designed and demonstrates promising polysulfide conversion activity among representative oxides. This work elucidates that t2 occupancy serves as an effective descriptor for evaluating the polysulfide conversion activity of spinel oxides. With the catalytic mechanism proposed, the current study prompts further exploration of the application of t2 occupancy as a descriptor for predicting the polysulfide conversion efficiency of other catalytic systems beyond the spinel structure.

 The nature of Archean tectonics and the associated geodynamic regimes are much debated in modern geoscience, despite decades of research. In this study, we present a geophysical model to show that, by the Neoarchean, convective forces from rising mantle plumes or early forms of plate subduction caused widespread extension, creating linear zones of crustal growth. These regimes can be identified as Archean rifts in the ancient rock record by the topography of the Moho, i.e., a shallowing of the boundary between the crust and the lithospheric mantle. Gravity data collected over the Abitibi greenstone belt, a particularly well-preserved portion of Neoarchean crust located in Canada’s Superior Province, was modeled to produce a topographic map of the Moho. The model shows corridors of shallow Moho surrounding islands of thick, intrusion-filled crust and is interpreted to be a snap-shot of microplate growth and breakup between 2.75 to 2.69 Ga. The connectivity of the interpreted relict rifts is possible evidence for the existence of Neoarchean plate boundaries and triple junctions and supports a model of at least local mobile-lid tectonics during this stage of Earth’s history.

Moreover, the ALD-AlOx forms a homogeneous film on the perovskite grain surface while creating island-like structures at grain boundaries, enabling nanoscale local contact areas for subsequent PDAI2 deposition.

 Segregated networks of mesoscale functional units convey highly specific functional signals within and across early visual areas. However, it remains unclear whether higher-order category-selective areas exhibit a similar mesoscale functional organization. In this study, we investigated the mesoscale functional architecture of face-, body-, and object-selective regions in macaque monkeys using sub-millimeter fMRI (0.22 mm3 voxels) combined with single-cell recordings. Our findings reveal that these category-selective areas are subdivided into spatially clustered mesoscale functional units, which are highly consistent across subjects. Notably, mesoscale functional units of the same type exhibit segregated interhemispheric functional connectivity, forming long-range mesoscale functional networks. Single-cell recordings from a body-selective area confirmed this mesoscale organization and showed a remarkable correspondence between fMRI-defined mesoscale functional units and neuronal tuning profiles. These mesoscale functional units also displayed sharp functional boundaries and response similarity decay patterns, similar to those observed in previous single-unit recordings.

 Variability in Arctic stratospheric ozone (ASO) has significant implications for surface climate. Using observational reanalysis datasets and Ozone Monitoring Instrument data, we found that the springtime ASO variations since the 2000s can serve as a precursor to El Niño–Southern Oscillation in the subsequent winter. Springtime ASO variability has become pronounced, particularly over Eurasia, due to the asymmetric structure of the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex. With the return of solar radiation to the Arctic in spring, elevated ASO increases solar absorption over Eurasia, contributing to localized stratospheric heating. This heating induces an upper-tropospheric cyclonic circulation over Siberia, facilitating wave energy propagation toward the tropical Pacific. Consequently, upper-level easterly and low-level westerly wind anomalies emerge over the equatorial Pacific, favoring El Niño development (cf. La Niña for decreased ASO). These results highlight the importance of chemical–radiative–dynamical processes in the Arctic stratosphere for understanding tropospheric climate variability."

 The impacts of boreal Forest Cover Change (FCC) during winter are somewhat neglected due to a lack of evapotranspiration and solar radiation. This study incorporates the observed FCC into the Earth System Model, and the ensemble simulations agree on a significant winter cooling over Eurasia with a land-atmosphere coupled framework caused by a weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex. We find that afforestation in western Europe leads to more snow interception on canopy in November, inhibiting snow accumulation and reducing surface albedo. The stronger snow-albedo feedback as the source of perturbation stimulates upward planetary wave propagations, weakening the stratospheric polar vortex, and forming a negative Arctic Oscillation pattern at the surface.

 The North China Craton underwent extensive lithospheric thinning and crustal reworking during the Mesozoic, challenging classic views of craton stability. This period marks a transition from tectonic quiescence to widespread reactivation, but timing and magnitude remain poorly constrained. Here we reconstruct crustal thickness evolution along the southern margin of the North China Craton using strontium to yttrium and lanthanum to ytterbium ratios, plus neodymium isotopic data from granitoids. Thickening began in the Jurassic and peaked around 130 Ma, when crustal thickness exceeded 70 km and palaeoelevation surpassed 5 km, forming a plateau comparable to the Tibetan Plateau. After ~128 Ma, thickness and elevation decreased to 30–40 km and <3 km by 125–110 Ma. These shifts parallel sedimentary, structural and geophysical evidence. We interpret this evolution as two stages: initial thickening from North China–Yangtze collision, followed by extensional collapse and lithospheric thinning likely driven by Paleo-Pacific plate rollback. The North China Craton underwent two distinct crustal stages, characterized by thickening due to Mesozoic collision, followed by extensional collapse and lithospheric thinning likely driven by PaleoPacific plate rollback, according to a crustal thickness reconstruction using Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios as well as εNd isotopic data of granitoids."

Joswig;Fabian D. Schneider;Hannes Feilhauer,Unraveling the seasonality of functional diversity through remote sensing,"Plant functional diversity is highly dynamic over time, driven by seasonal cycles and wet–dry periods and varying across biomes, based on an analysis of over 4,000 hyperspectral satellite scenes at the global scale. 
 Plant functional diversity is a key biodiversity indicator of ecosystem dynamics. Several studies have shown that spectral data from Earth observation satellites will enable us to map functional diversity over large areas. However, most studies only consider snapshots of such data in time, and our knowledge of the temporal variation of functional diversity across the World’s biomes remains sparse. Here, we use hyperspectral remote sensing and deep learning to explore multi-seasonal functional diversity patterns on a global scale. We show that functional diversity can be highly dynamic over time. These dynamics are biome-specific, driven by seasonal cycles and wet-dry periods. Our findings highlight that the role of functional diversity in shaping ecosystem dynamics can be unraveled only by incorporating seasonality into functional diversity mapping. Such a multi-temporal approach will enhance the robustness of functional diversity assessments and deepen our understanding of ecosystem responses to environmental change.
