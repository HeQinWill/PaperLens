10.5194/acp-24-13341-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了硝酸铵-蔗糖-水三元体系的粘度，以及其对气溶胶粒子中气粒分配的影响。研究发现，含有硝酸铵的混合气溶胶的粘度远低于纯有机气溶胶，并且其内部混合时间较短，这使得在大多数对流层条件下，假设气粒分配处于平衡状态是合理的。该研究结果对大气化学模型中气粒分配的模拟具有重要意义，因为它有助于更准确地预测大气中气态污染物的浓度和分布。  由于该研究关注的是大气气溶胶的物理化学性质及其对气粒分配的影响，这与大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。例如，了解气溶胶的粘度有助于改进遥感反演算法，更准确地估算大气中气溶胶的含量和类型。,"['Ammonium nitrate', 'Aerosol particles', 'Viscosity', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Gas-particle partitioning']",Liviana K. Klein;Allan K. Bertram;Andreas Zuend;Florence Gregson;Ulrich K. Krieger,Viscosity of aqueous ammonium nitrate–organic particles: equilibrium partitioning may be a reasonable assumption for most tropospheric conditions,"The viscosity of ammonium nitrate–sucrose–H2O was quantified with three methods ranging from liquid to solid state depending on the relative humidity. Moreover, the corresponding estimated internal aerosol mixing times remained below 1 h for most tropospheric conditions, making equilibrium partitioning a reasonable assumption. 
 The viscosity of aerosol particles determines the critical mixing time of gas–particle partitioning of volatile compounds in the atmosphere. The partitioning of the semi-volatile ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) might alter the viscosity of highly viscous secondary organic aerosol particles during their lifetimes. In contrast to the viscosity of organic particles, data on the viscosity of internally mixed inorganic–organic aerosol particles are scarce. We determined the viscosity of an aqueous ternary inorganic–organic system consisting of NH4NO3 and a proxy compound for a highly viscous organic, sucrose. Three techniques were applied to cover the atmospherically relevant humidity range: viscometry, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and the poke-flow technique. We show that the viscosity of NH4NO3–sucrose–H2O with an organic to inorganic dry mass ratio of 4:1 is  4 orders of magnitude lower than the viscosity of the aqueous sucrose under low-humidity conditions (30 % relative humidity (RH), 293 K). By comparing viscosity predictions of mixing rules with those of the Aerosol Inorganic–Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients Viscosity  (AIOMFAC-VISC) model, we found that a mixing rule based on mole fractions performs similarly when data from corresponding binary aqueous subsystems are available. Applying this mixing rule, we estimated the characteristic internal mixing time of aerosol particles, indicating significantly faster mixing for inorganic–organic mixtures compared to electrolyte-free particles, especially at lower RH. Hence, the assumption in global atmospheric chemistry models of quasi-instantaneous equilibrium gas–particle partitioning is reasonable for internally mixed single-phase particles containing dissolved electrolytes (but not necessarily for phase-separated particles), for most conditions in the planetary boundary layer. Further data are needed to see whether this assumption holds for the entire troposphere at midlatitudes and at RH > 35 %."

Understanding this composition of PM is important for identifying its sources, assessing potential health risks, and developing strategies to reduce air pollution. The PX-375 monitor proved to be a valuable tool for ongoing air quality monitoring studies and could be particularly useful as pollution levels and sources change in the future. 
 Knowledge of the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM) is essential for understanding its source distribution, identifying potential health impacts of toxic elements, and developing efficient air pollution abatement strategies. Traditional methods for analysing PM composition, such as collection on filter substrates and subsequent offline analysis with, for example, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), are time-consuming and prone to measurement errors due to multiple preparation steps. Emerging near-real-time techniques based on non-destructive energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) offer advantages for continuous monitoring and source apportionment.This study characterizes the Horiba PX-375 EDXRF monitor by applying a straightforward performance evaluation including (a) limit of detection (LoD), (b) identification and quantification of uncertainty sources, and (c) investigation and comparison of measurement results from three contrasting sites in Luxembourg (urban, semi-urban, rural). We used multi-element reference materials (ME-RMs) from UC Davis for calibration and performed measurements during spring and summer 2023. The LoDs for toxic elements like Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb were below 3 ng m−3 at 1 h time resolution. Higher LoDs were observed for lighter elements (e.g. Al, Si, S, K, Ca). Expanded uncertainties ranged between 5 % and 25 % for elemental concentrations above 20 ng m−3 and were maximal for concentrations below 10 ng m−3, reaching 60 %–85 %. Elemental analysis revealed S and mineral elements (Fe, Si, Ca, Al) as dominant contributors to PM10. Although the PM mass contribution of toxic trace elements (e.g. Zn, Cu, As) was generally very low, they were found to be enriched at the urban site Belvaux and the semi-urban site Remich compared to the more rural site Vianden. Our results explained on average 51 %–74 % of the gravimetric PM10 mass at the three sites. The study highlights the suitability and importance of the continuous PX-375 particle monitor for future air quality monitoring and source apportionment studies, particularly under changing emission scenarios and air pollution abatement strategies."

A new automated quality control analysis has been performed starting from the original raw data and operational log sheets. The data have been formatted and standardized according to the latest community best practices, and all available metadata have been inserted, including calibration information and uncertainty specification. 
 The advent of open science and the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development are revolutionizing the ocean-data-sharing landscape for an efficient and transparent ocean information and knowledge generation. This blue revolution raised awareness on the importance of metadata and community standards to activate interoperability of the digital assets (data and services) and guarantee that data-driven science preserves provenance, lineage and quality information for its replicability. Historical data are frequently not compliant with these criteria, lacking metadata information that was not retained, crucial at the time of data generation and further ingestion into marine data infrastructures. The present data review is an example attempt to fill this gap through a thorough data reprocessing starting from the original raw data and operational log sheets. The data gathered using XBT (eXpendable BathyThermograph) probes during several monitoring activities in the Tyrrhenian and Ligurian seas between 1999 and 2019 have first been formatted and standardized according to the latest community best practices and all available metadata have been inserted, including calibration information never applied, uncertainty specification and bias correction from Cheng et al. (2014). Secondly, a new automatic quality control (QC) procedure has been developed and a new interpolation scheme applied. The reprocessed (REP) dataset has been compared to the data version, presently available from the SeaDataNet (SDN) data access portal, processed according to the pioneering work of Manzella et al. (2003) conducted in the framework of the European Union Mediterranean Forecasting System Pilot Project (Pinardi et al., 2003). The comparison between REP and SDN datasets has the objective to highlight the main differences derived from the new data processing process. The maximum discrepancy among the REP and SDN data versions always resides within the surface layer (REP profiles are warmer than SDN ones) until 150 m depth generally when the thermocline settles (from June to November). The overall bias and root mean square difference are equal to 0.002 and 0.041 °C, respectively. Such differences are mainly due to the new interpolation technique (Barker and McDougall, 2020) and the application of the calibration correction in the REP dataset.The REP dataset (Reseghetti et al., 2024; https://doi.org/10.13127/rep_xbt_1999_2019.2) is available and accessible through the INGV (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Bologna) ERDDAP (Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program) server, which allows for machine-to-machine data access in compliance with the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016)."

Walvoord,Permafrost-wildfire interactions: Active layer thickness estimates for paired burned and unburned sites in northern high-latitudes,"Wildfires have the potential to accelerate permafrost thaw and the associated feedbacks to climate change. We assembled a data set of permafrost thaw depth measurements from burned and unburned sites contributed by researchers from across the northern high latitude region. We estimated maximum thaw depth for each measurement, which addresses a key challenge: the ability to assess impacts of wildfire on maximum thaw depth when measurement timing varies. 
 As the northern high latitude permafrost zone experiences accelerated warming, permafrost has become vulnerable to widespread thaw. Simultaneously, wildfire activity across northern boreal forest and Arctic/subarctic tundra regions impact permafrost stability through the combustion of insulating organic matter, vegetation and post-fire changes in albedo. Efforts to synthesise the impacts of wildfire on permafrost are limited and are typically reliant on antecedent pre-fire conditions. To address this, we created the FireALT dataset by soliciting data contributions that included thaw depth measurements, site conditions, and fire event details with paired measurements at environmentally comparable burned and unburned sites. The solicitation resulted in 52,466 thaw depth measurements from 18 contributors across North America and Russia. Because thaw depths were taken at various times throughout the thawing season, we also estimated end of season active layer thickness (ALT) for each measurement using a modified version of the Stefan equation. Here, we describe our methods for collecting and quality checking the data, estimating ALT, the data structure, strengths and limitations, and future research opportunities. The final dataset includes 47,952 ALT estimates (27,747 burned, 20,205 unburned) with 32 attributes. There are 193 unique paired burned/unburned sites spread across 12 ecozones that span Canada, Russia, and the United States. The data span fire events from 1900 to 2022. Time since fire ranges from zero to 114 years. The FireALT dataset addresses a key challenge: the ability to assess impacts of wildfire on ALT when measurements are taken at various times throughout the thaw season depending on the time of field campaigns (typically June through August) by estimating ALT at the end of season maximum. This dataset can be used to address understudied research areas particularly algorithm development, calibration, and validation for evolving process-based models as well as extrapolating across space and time, which could elucidate permafrost-wildfire interactions under accelerated warming across the high northern latitude permafrost zone. The FireALT dataset is available through the Arctic Data Center."

We formalise a software package that calibrates the open-source FaIR simple climate model to full-complexity Earth system models. Observations, including historical warming, and assessments of key climate variables such as that of climate sensitivity are used to constrain the model output. 
 Simple climate models (also known as emulators) have re-emerged as critical tools for the analysis of climate policy. Emulators are efficient and highly parameterised, where the parameters are tunable to produce a diversity of global mean surface temperature (GMST) response pathways to a given emission scenario. Only a small fraction of possible parameter combinations will produce historically consistent climate hindcasts, a necessary condition for trust in future projections. Alongside historical GMST, additional observed (e.g. ocean heat content) and emergent climate metrics (such as the equilibrium climate sensitivity) can be used as constraints upon the parameter sets used for climate projections. This paper describes a multi-variable constraining package for the Finite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) simple climate model (FaIR versions 2.1.0 onwards) using a Bayesian framework. The steps are, first, to generate prior distributions of parameters for FaIR based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) Earth system models or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-assessed ranges; second, to generate a large Monte Carlo prior ensemble of parameters to run FaIR with; and, third, to produce a posterior set of parameters constrained on several observable and assessed climate metrics. Different calibrations can be produced for different emission datasets or observed climate constraints, allowing version-controlled and continually updated calibrations to be produced. We show that two very different future projections to a given emission scenario can be obtained using emissions from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) (fair-calibrate v1.4.0) and from updated emission datasets through 2022 (fair-calibrate v1.4.1) for similar climate constraints in both cases. fair-calibrate can be reconfigured for different source emission datasets or target climate distributions, and new versions will be produced upon availability of new climate system data."

Using simulations, we developed a more accurate method that works efficiently, making it suitable for application in weather and climate prediction models. The new approach is numerically verified and provides precise predictions of ice formation events and reliable estimates of key parameters. 
 The present work aims to extend the parameterisation of homogeneous ice nucleation introduced in Dolaptchiev et al. (2023) by incorporating variable ice mean mass and generalizing the approach under different conditions. The proposed method involves introducing an empirically derived correction based on a large data set of parcel model simulations. The method is validated against ensemble simulations using double-moment ice microphysics, showing a mean deviation of less than 16 % from the reference solution, with robust performance across a range of conditions. The uncertainty of the extended parameterisation is evaluated for the increasing integration time steps. The method remains computationally efficient and produces sufficiently accurate results, even with larger time steps, making it suitable for integration into numerical weather prediction models. It is shown that the generalized approach not only provides a good representation of individual nucleation events but also effectively captures the statistics across the ensemble data. The prediction of ice mixing ratio is also assessed against the reference full double-moment system results. Despite a significant error in the initial prediction, it is demonstrated that the integration of the system over several time steps equilibrates the inconsistencies. This refined parameterisation offers a more accurate prediction of ice number concentration and ice mixing ratio and is not limited to gravity wave induced perturbations and can be supplemented by other relevant dynamical effects, such as turbulence."

Despite decades of research, wildfires are still challenging to represent in air quality and chemistry-climate models. Wildfire plume rise (injection) is one of those poorly resolved processes and is also a major source of uncertainty in evaluating the wildfire impacts on air quality. Studies have shown that current plume rise models are subject to large uncertainties, including the Freitas Scheme, a widely used 1-dimensional, cloud-resolving subgrid model. In this work, a new machine learning-based plume rise emulator is presented, trained using a high-resolution, turbulence-resolving large eddy simulation (LES) model coupled with microphysics. The preliminary results show that this machine learning emulator outperforms the benchmark model, the Freitas scheme, in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, a bagging ensemble is built to further increase the robustness and to battle internal variability. Efforts have been made to ensure that the machine learning emulator is robust, transparent, and not overtrained, and the results are interpretable and physically sound.

However, the slow and unsustainable dissolution of silicate minerals in natural environments remains a challenge. This study proposed a new CO2 capture system that uses the combined effect of amino acids and NaCl to promote mineral dissolution, and its characteristics were investigated experimentally. The results showed that amino acids are promising for enhancing the near-congruent dissolution of silicate minerals, specifically at weakly alkaline pHs (i.e., 8), implying the long-term effectiveness of the system. Comprehensive findings revealed a 13-fold increase in the level of Ca extraction from wollastonite (CaSiO3) in the presence of 0.1 mol/L glutamic acid (Glu) over 72 h at 35 °C and a 22-fold increase in the level of CO2 capture efficiency. However, Fe-bearing minerals, such as olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4), are unsuitable for application, because the enhanced Fe extraction results in the generation of Fe hydroxide, which lowers pH and consequently reduces CO2 capture efficiency. Moreover, NaCl facilitates the release of the Ca–Glu complex from mineral surfaces into the solution, synergizing amino acids to promote mineral dissolution.

As heatwaves of increasing severity occur, communities face more serious exposure to ozone, necessitating a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of heatwaves on the nonlinear response of ozone to its precursors for guiding policies in emission reductions. Here we estimate the spatiotemporal evolution of global ozone chemistry based on machine learning and in situ observations and show that emission changes and heatwaves alter ozone photochemical regimes, leading to diverse ozone changes across regions. Sustained emission reductions in East Asia decreased the ozone formation sensitivity to formaldehyde (HCHO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), counteracting the adverse high-temperature effect. Quantified results reveal that heatwaves increased the sensitivity of ozone to HCHO and PM2.5, enhancing their positive contributions and causing increased ozone trends across most regions, with a global average anomaly of 9.4 μg/m3. Meanwhile, heatwave-induced PM2.5 anomalies concentrated in wildfire-risk zones, coupled with increased HCHO, elevated downwind ozone levels. Specifically, the effects in wildfire-endangered western Canada and heatwave-exposed southeastern United States contributed to a chemically driven ozone increase of 0.18 μg/m3/month in Northern America.

However, the strain distribution associated with these faults at mantle depths is not well understood. At the heart of this question is the rheology of the lithosphere: when stressed by displacement on a trans‐crustal fault, does the uppermost mantle localize strain in a continuing narrow fault zone, or is that strain instead distributed in a shear zone that widens with increasing depth? This study uses harmonic decomposition of receiver functions to measure the spatial and depth distribution of seismic anisotropy, a proxy for viscous deformation, around the Alpine Fault in Aotearoa New Zealand. Anisotropy aligned with the fault is present in the lithosphere at least 100 km away from the fault trace, suggesting that the Alpine Fault shear zone widens at depth."
10.1029/2024GL113309,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文介绍了中国2022年发射的大气环境监测卫星（AEMS）上搭载的集成路径差分吸收（IPDA）激光雷达用于监测全球CO2柱浓度（XCO2）的研究。研究重点在于利用该技术测量云顶CO2浓度，并利用SRTM数据对云高数据进行了验证，结果显示两者高度相关。此外，研究还利用该技术评估了海洋碳吸收速率，并与其他碳通量数据进行了对比，结果吻合良好。总的来说，该研究展示了IPDA激光雷达技术在遥感云顶CO2和量化海洋碳吸收方面的巨大潜力，属于大气环境遥感技术，特别是利用卫星观测进行大气成分分析的范畴。,"['CO2', 'column concentration', 'cloud top', 'satellite', 'lidar', 'IPDA', 'AEMS', 'ocean carbon uptake', 'atmospheric composition', 'remote sensing']",Zhihua Mao;Yang Zhang;Lingbing Bu;Qin Wang;Wei Xiao;Xuhui Lee;Dingyuan Liang;Khalid Muhammad Burhan;Jiqiao Liu;Weibiao Chen;Sihan Liu;Zhongting Wang,Measurement of CO2 Column Concentration Above Cloud Tops With a Spaceborne IPDA Lidar,"The Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Satellite (AEMS), launched by China in 2022, was equipped with active remote sensing lidar for carbon monitoring. It adopts the Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) technology to monitor global CO2 column concentration (XCO2). The calculation of cloud top XCO2 requires cloud height data. A comparison between SRTM global elevation data and 1,572 nm channel elevation data reveals a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.998, with an average deviation of 1.24 m. The cloud top XCO2 observations are consistent with the OCO‐2 and CarbonTracker trends. The ocean carbon uptake rate, assessed by the difference in CO2 concentration between cloud top and sea surface, is −0.319 mmol/m2/h, which is in good agreement with the associated carbon flux data. This demonstrates the great potential of IPDA lidar for remote sensing of cloud top CO2 and quantifying ocean carbon uptake."
10.1029/2024JD041353,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了Goddard地球观测系统(GEOS)模型在模拟东南大西洋地区大气环流时出现的偏差，特别是过量下沉现象。该偏差与生物质燃烧气溶胶的季节性输送以及海洋层积云到积云的转变有关。研究使用了再分析资料(MERRA-2和ERA5)以及自由运行模拟，对比分析了不同版本的GEOS模型以及不同气象数据约束下的模拟结果。结果表明，过量下沉现象在一定程度上源于陆地上的初始条件，并与气溶胶本身的垂直运动调整有关。虽然气溶胶的自我抬升作用可以减轻海洋上空的下沉，但其影响程度远小于MERRA-2再分析资料中的偏差。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它分析了卫星观测资料(例如ORACLES任务)与模型模拟结果之间的差异，并试图改进大气成分(气溶胶)的模拟精度，从而提升空气质量监测和预报的准确性。,"['aerosol', 'biomass burning', 'subsidence', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition', 'GEOS model', 'MERRA-2', 'ORACLES campaign', 'vertical motion']",Allison Collow;Sampa Das;Peter R. Colarco;Arlindo M. da Silva;Mark Miller;Nathan Arnold,Diagnosing Excessive Subsidence Across the Southeast Atlantic in the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) During ORACLES‐1,"Complicated by seasonal transport of biomass burning aerosol plumes primarily overlaying the marine stratocumulus‐to‐cumulus transition, the complexity of the atmosphere over the southeast Atlantic Ocean is difficult to represent in models. Biases with respect to the height of the aerosol plume and excessive subsidence have previously been documented in MERRA‐2. This paper further diagnoses these biases, and addresses the unreasonable subsidence over the southeast Atlantic region currently simulated by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model during the first deployment of the ORACLES campaign in September 2016. Our study is based on model simulations where the meteorological state is constrained by the GEOS‐based MERRA‐2 reanalysis, as well as by ERA5, using the so‐called replay technique. Free running simulations with the GEOS model show excessive subsidence that begins over land such that aerosol transported by the easterly jet reaches a strip of complex terrain and is forced downward; a similar behavior can be found in the MERRA‐2 reanalysis. This excessive subsidence has been somewhat reduced by improved parameterizations found in recent versions of the GEOS model. However, any replay constrained by MERRA‐2 meteorology, even those based on recent versions of GEOS, suffer from the same excessive subsidence. An additional set of simulations in which the GEOS model was free‐running was used to quantify the role of aerosol itself in adjusting the profile of vertical motion. While self‐lofting of biomass burning aerosol reduces the subsidence over the ocean, the magnitude of its impact is only a fraction of the bias in MERRA‐2."

Using a Lagrangian approach, we investigated the moisture transport regime and identified the circulation pattern responsible for the EPE. The primary moisture sources were the northwest Pacific (24%), southeast China (21%), and the South China Sea (20%). The circulation pattern, featuring the western Pacific subtropical high to the northeast, tropical cyclone KHANUN in the northwest Pacific, and a low‐pressure system southwest of the Hai River Basin, predominantly controlled the moisture transport. We discovered that an unprecedented EPE in 1963 exhibited a similar circulation pattern. By classifying historical EPEs into three categories based on seven atmospheric predictors, we identified circulation patterns associated with disaster‐prone events. The most frequent category is characterized by a circulation pattern with positive geopotential height anomalies in northeast Asia and negative anomalies to the south, extending from the northwest Pacific to the Hai River Basin. This classification provides insights into the atmospheric conditions conducive to severe EPEs in the region."

 Antarctica is currently losing net mass to the ocean primarily from West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, which together hold ~5.5 m of sea level rise potential. Yet, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet stores almost ten times more ice, and its evolution contributes significant uncertainty to sea level rise projections, mainly due to insufficient process-scale observations. Here we report the collapse of the Conger–Glenzer Ice Shelf in East Antarctica that culminated with its March 2022 disintegration. We use a combination of observations to document its evolution over four stages spanning 25 years, starting 1997–2000 when small calving events isolated it from the Shackleton Ice Shelf. In 2011, it retreated from a central pinning point, followed by relative calving quiescence for a decade; the remaining ~1,200 km2 of the ice shelf disintegrated over a few days in mid-March 2022. These observations of the Conger–Glenzer Ice Shelf collapse shed light on the processes involved, in particular, the impacts of ocean and atmospheric warming and extreme weather events. Ice shelf collapses, rare in the satellite record so far, have substantial implications for the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet and its contribution to future sea level rise.

Authors demonstrate such optical modes that propagate at the edge of truncated photonic crystal structures composed of an array of silicon pillars. 
 Bound states in the continuum are optical modes with extremely high-quality factors and narrow resonances, which exist in the dispersion spectrum of the radiative region above the light line. A unique bound state in the continuum is supported at the edge of truncated photonic crystals, which is a type of a Fabry-Pérot type bound state in the continuum, but has never been observed in experiments. Here, we demonstrate the bound states in the continuum supported at the edge array of silicon (Si) pillars whose diameter is bigger than that of the rest of a Si-pillar two-dimensional photonic crystal. We also show the tunability of the resonance and surface sensitivity of the mode when Si pillars are conformally coated with nanometer-thick aluminium oxide films. The presence of an oxide nanofilm improves the quality factor by over 60 % and shifts the resonance wavelength. Such behavior signifies the substantial potential of the bound states in the continuum on two-dimensional photonic crystals for post-fabrication tuning of the quality factor and surface sensing applications.

Here, researchers measured antibodies in serum and saliva from a strep throat human challenge trial. Baseline antibodies led to variable responses and affected susceptibility to strep throat. 
 Knowledge gaps regarding human immunity to Streptococcus pyogenes have impeded vaccine development. To address these gaps and evaluate vaccine candidates, we established a human challenge model of S. pyogenes pharyngitis. Here, we analyse antibody responses in serum and saliva against 19 antigens to identify characteristics distinguishing 19 participants who developed pharyngitis and 6 who did not. We show that pharyngitis elicits serum IgG responses to key vaccine antigens and a muted mucosal IgA response, whereas IgG responses are minimal and IgA responses more pronounced in participants without pharyngitis. Serum IgG responses to pharyngitis in adult participants resemble those in children and are inversely correlated with the magnitude of pre-existing responses. While a straightforward correlate of protection is not evident, baseline antibody signatures distinguish clinical and immunological outcomes following experimental challenge. This highlights the influence of a complex humoral imprint from previous exposure, relevant for interpreting immunogenicity in forthcoming vaccine trials.

 Advances in X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offer the promise of elucidating functionally relevant conformational changes that are not easily studied by other biophysical methods. Here we show that 3D variability analysis (3DVA) of the cryo-EM map for wild-type (WT) human asparagine synthetase (ASNS) identifies a functional role for the Arg-142 side chain and test this hypothesis experimentally by characterizing the R142I variant in which Arg-142 is replaced by isoleucine. Support for Arg-142 playing a role in the intramolecular translocation of ammonia between the active site of the enzyme is provided by the glutamine-dependent synthetase activity of the R142 variant relative to WT ASNS, and MD simulations provide a possible molecular mechanism for these findings. Combining 3DVA with MD simulations is a generally applicable approach to generate testable hypotheses of how conformational changes in buried side chains might regulate function in enzymes.

Here, the authors reveal that BAZ1B inhibits ATAD5-UAF1-USP1, thereby preventing premature PCNA de-ubiquitination during lesion bypass under replicative stress. 
 Mono-ubiquitinated PCNA (mono-Ub-PCNA) is generated when replication forks encounter obstacles, enabling the bypass of DNA lesions. After resolving stalled forks, Ub-PCNA must be de-ubiquitinated to resume high-fidelity DNA synthesis. ATAD5, in cooperation with the UAF1-USP1 complex, is responsible for this de-ubiquitination. However, the precise regulation of timely Ub-PCNA de-ubiquitination remains unclear. Our research reveals that BAZ1B, a regulatory subunit of the BAZ1B-SMARCA5 chromatin-remodeling complex (also known as the WICH complex), plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the de-ubiquitination process of Ub-PCNA. The BAZ1B binding region of ATAD5 encompasses the UAF1-binding domain of ATAD5. Disruption of the ATAD5-BAZ1B interaction results in premature de-ubiquitination of Ub-PCNA following treatment with hydrogen peroxide. Cells with impaired BAZ1B binding to ATAD5 display increased sensitivity to oxidative stress compared to wild-type cells. These findings suggest that BAZ1B prevents premature Ub-PCNA de-ubiquitination, thereby safeguarding genome integrity. Regulation of PCNA ubiquitination is required for initiating lesion bypass and ensuring subsequent high-fidelity replication and ensure genome stability.

 Tipping points have gained substantial traction in climate change discourses. Here we critique the ‘tipping point’ framing for oversimplifying the diverse dynamics of complex natural and human systems and for conveying urgency without fostering a meaningful basis for climate action. Multiple social scientific frameworks suggest that the deep uncertainty and perceived abstractness of climate tipping points render them ineffective for triggering action and setting governance goals. The framing also promotes confusion between temperature-based policy benchmarks and properties of the climate system. In both natural and human systems, we advocate for clearer, more specific language to describe the phenomena labelled as tipping points and for critical evaluation of whether, how and why different framings can support scientific understanding and climate risk management.

Cyanobacteria are virtually absent from Lake Enigma ice and water column although they are well represented in its extensive and diverse benthic microbial mats.

 Campi Flegrei is the largest active caldera in Europe and it is home to more than 350,000 people. Since 2005, the caldera has shown accelerating ground inflation and an intensification of seismic activity. Here we quantify the decadal accelerating trend alongside oscillations of various frequencies and explore the relationships between deformation and seismic activity over the period 2000 to November 2023. Results highlight the major changes that have occurred in the last four years analyzed and reveal a parabolic increase in vertical uplift and a super-exponential (squared-exponential) rise in the number of earthquakes and seismic energy release. Inspection of data indicate a close temporal correlation between deformation rate and seismicity, and an exponential relationship, with an exponent increasing over time, between ground deformation and cumulative number of earthquakes. These relationships are consistent with a quasi-elastic behavior and a stress memory (Kaiser) effect of the upper crust of the caldera under an increasing stress suggesting a progressive mechanical weakening. Most importantly, they provide evidence of an accelerating sensitivity of seismic activity to caldera inflation and warn of the possibility of significant seismic events in case of continuation, with the same trends and relations, of the bradyseismic crisis in the next years.

 We present a new method for estimating biophysical parameters from Earth Observation (EO) data using a crop-specific empirical model based on the PROSAIL Radiative Transfer (RT) model, called an ‘archetype’ model. The first-order model presented uses maximum biophysical parameter magnitude, phenological and soil parameters to describe the spectral reflectance (400–2500 nm) of vegetation over time. The approach assumes smooth variation and archetypical coordination of crop biophysical parameters over time for a given crop. The form of coordination is learned from a large sample of observations. Using Sentinel-2 observations of maize from Northeast China in 2019, we map reflectance to biophysical parameters using an inverse model operator, synchronise the parameters to a consistent time frame using a double logistic model of LAI, then derive the model archetypes as the median value of the synchronised samples. We apply the model to estimate time series of biophysical parameters for different cereal crops using an ensemble framework with a weighted K-nearest neighbour solution, and validate the results with ground measurements of different crops collected near Munich, Germany in 2017 and 2018. The results show R values greater than 0.8 for leaf area index (LAI) and leaf brown pigment content (Cbrown), with an RMSE of 0.94 m2/m2 for LAI and 0.15 for Cbrown. The chlorophyll content (Cab) and canopy water content (CCw) were retrieved at a higher level of accuracy, with R values around 0.9 and an RMSE of 6.59μg/cm2 for Cab and 0.03 g/cm2 for CCw. Comparison of forward-modelled hyperspectral reflectance with independent ground measures shows that the retrieved parameters account for 90% of the variation in canopy reflectance, with an overall RMSE of around 0.05 in reflectance units. The retrievals for all terms are mostly within 1σ when measurement and prediction uncertainty are taken into account, except for some early and late season issues in leaf and canopy water due to the complexity of canopy structure and understory during these periods. The approach provides a new form of constraint for the simultaneous estimation of biophysical parameters from EO and greatly reduces the rank of the problem. It is suitable for monitoring crop conditions where biophysical parameters vary smoothly over time consistently with each archetype form. The approach can be refined for other canopy types and canopy representations and could provide strong constraints on expected smoothly-varying canopy features to aid in the interpretation of EO signals across different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum."

 Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for the precise quantification of energy and water budgets under climate change. Remote sensing ET models provide an effective way to map ET across different spatial and temporal scales. However, conductance-based ET models such as PML_V2 are associated with limited or no water stress constraints on soil evaporation and canopy transpiration that could cause significant bias for sparse vegetation in arid and semi-arid areas. To meet this challenge for using conductance-based ET models, we proposed to use shortwave infrared information to serve as a water stress constraint to vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation, and an improved ET model (PML_SWIR) was proposed. The PML_SWIR model was calibrated with ET measurements from 21 eddy covariance flux towers distributed across China, and showed good performance for estimating ET (R2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 0.72 mm/day) for the cross-validation dataset. PML_SWIR outperformed PML_V2 in estimating ET for arid and semi-arid areas, indicated by RMSE being 7.86 and 25.93 mm/year lower and bias being 4.74 and 16.63 % less compared with PML_V2(China) and PML_V2(Global) for ET estimation over Xinjiang Province. In addition, PML_SWIR was noticeably better than PML_V2 for depicting the ET patterns for these seasonal rivers in the arid areas. The ET values estimated by PML_SWIR were further compared with other ET products. The results indicated that PML_SWIR well characterized the ET pattern in arid and semi-arid areas, and the estimated ET values showed good agreement with the water balance-based ET (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 91.37 mm/year) in major river basins of China. The PML_SWIR ET estimates indicated that 20.2 % of the area of China increased significantly in ET over the study period, mainly due to vegetation greening caused by cropland expansion and the large-scale afforestation program. Overall, our results demonstrated that the incorporation of SWIR-based water stress constraints into the conductance-based ET model was a very promising way for accurately mapping ET in arid and semi-arid areas, and that the PML_SWIR model was highly applicable to regional high spatiotemporal ET mapping."

 The efficient and automated identification of landslide hazards is essential for socio-economic development and human safety. Integrating the feature extraction capabilities of deep learning with the millimeter-level precision of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology establishes a foundation for this task. However, current methods require unwrapping interferograms, and even converting them into deformation products before identifying landslide hazards. This process is susceptible to unwrapping errors, resulting in inefficient data utilization, and demands considerable time and labor. To overcome these challenges, wrapped interferograms are directly utilized for identifying creeping landslides. In this study, trigonometric functions are applied to improve the representation of interferograms and to further enhance the data through rendering. Secondly, a multi-branch semantic segmentation network (MB-Net) was designed, with parallel branch encoding and progressive feature fusion to optimize the model’s ability to learn interferometric phases. Experimental results indicate a good performance, with the F1-score of 80.91 %, the Intersection over Union (IoU) of 67.94 %, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 80.16 % on the ISSLIDE dataset. To further validate the generalization capability of MB-Net, the public COMET-LiCS Sentinel-1 InSAR portal data was utilized, focusing on the middle reaches of the Jinsha River in China. The results highlight MB-Net’s efficacy in spatial transferability analysis. These findings emphasize the potential of our approach for large-scale landslide hazard identification, providing a crucial foundation for the utilization of interferograms in creeping landslide detection."

 Hyperspectral images (HSIs) acquired from different imaging platforms are inevitably contaminated by multiple types of noise. However, the existing supervised learning based denoising methods often show poor generalizability on data with complex degradation, due to the discrepancy between synthetic training data and real data. Although some unsupervised denoisers have been developed to learn priors on real data, the noise assumptions or image priors in these methods limit their performances. In this paper, an unsupervised noise estimation and restoration (UNER) framework is proposed based on disentangled representation learning, to create an interband representation space that is resistant to noise within a single HSI, i.e., an interband-invariant representation space. Real HSIs are categorized internally into noisy and clean bands by noise intensity estimation. Intraband and interband disentangled reconstruction are designed to train two encoder-decoder modules to learn the interband-invariant representation. Noise patterns are separated from HSIs by transforming noisy bands into the representation space without introducing hand-crafted priors. The estimated noise and clean bands are then combined to train the self-supervised interband information restoration module, thereby exploiting spectral correlation and restoring the latent noise-free data with high information fidelity. In this way, the UNER framework can learn specific priors from real HSIs without clean data and be applied to various scenarios with complicated noise patterns. Noise removal experiments conducted on three airborne hyperspectral datasets representing urban, agricultural, and forestry areas respectively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed UNER framework over the state-of-the-art hyperspectral denoising methods."
