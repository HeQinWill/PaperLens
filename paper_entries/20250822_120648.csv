However, concerns remained about their effectiveness. Our independent study examined real-world vehicle emissions and revealed encouraging findings: modern diesel cars perform as well as, or even better than, gasoline cars in terms of nitrogen oxide emissions. We found the same pattern for soot particles, challenging common perceptions about diesel's environmental impact. 
 Real-world vehicle emissions measurement methods were developed to bridge the gap between laboratory tests and actual on-road emissions, including the variability in vehicles, drivers, and environmental conditions. The on-road chasing method is a cost-effective approach capable of capturing emissions from numerous vehicles. While it has been used extensively to measure truck emissions, it has not been applied systematically to diesel- and gasoline-powered cars. This study addresses that gap by comparing data from three on-road chasing campaigns conducted in 2011, 2017, and 2023 to evaluate the impact of emissions control technologies and regulatory policies on diesel- and gasoline-powered vehicles. Results show that diesel particulate filters (DPFs) reduce black carbon (BC) emission factors by 88 % compared to pre-DPF Euro 4 diesel-powered cars, while real driving emissions (RDE) regulations lower nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 86 % relative to pre-RDE Euro 6b diesel-powered cars. This is the first study to apply the chasing method over a decade to a representative sample of European vehicles and to report real-world BC emission factors for cars compliant with Euro 5b–6d. Lorentz curve analysis reveals a growing influence of high-emission vehicles (“super-emitters”) on total fleet emissions, suggesting that targeting super-emitters could yield substantial reductions in traffic-related pollution. Despite methodological variability, the results are consistent across campaigns and align with major regulatory milestones, thus confirming the chasing method's utility as a robust tool for super-emitter identification and fleet-wide emissions monitoring. By providing real-world evidence of regulatory effectiveness, this work supports scientific understanding and confidence in emissions policy."

A quantitative comparison between the pure rotational and vibrational–rotational Raman lidar approaches is presented. A minor impact of a wrong Ångström exponent on the determined aerosol optical properties is found. 
 Vertical profiles of aerosol properties are essential for assessing the impact of aerosols on cloud formation and the Earth's radiation budget. Lidars can provide profiles of the particle backscatter and extinction coefficients and the extinction-to-backscatter ratio (lidar ratio). An Ångström exponent has to be assumed when computing these profiles from nitrogen vibrational–rotational  Raman signals. This assumption introduces uncertainties. An alternative approach is the rotational Raman lidar method, which does not need an Ångström exponent as input. This study presents a quantitative comparison between the pure rotational and vibrational–rotational Raman lidar approaches to assess the impact of the Ångström exponent assumption on the vibrational–rotational Raman lidar solutions. In this short article, we present four contrasting case studies based on observations of wildfire smoke, Saharan dust, residential wood combustion smoke, and a cirrus layer. The optical properties are derived at a wavelength of 532 nm, with the rotational Raman signals measured at 530 nm and the vibrational–rotational Raman signals measured at 607 nm. It was found that the use of an Ångström exponent, deviating by 1 from the true value, introduces relative uncertainties of 5 % and less (backscatter coefficient), 5 %–10 % (extinction coefficient), and around 10 % (lidar ratio) in the vibrational–rotational Raman lidar solutions."

Fu,A vegetation phenology dataset developed by integrating multiple sources using the reliability ensemble averaging method,"Global changes have significantly altered vegetation phenology, affecting terrestrial carbon cycles. While various remote-sensing-based phenology datasets exist, they often suffer from inconsistencies and uncertainties. To address this, we developed a new phenology dataset spanning 1982–2020 using a reliability ensemble averaging method. Validated against ground data, our dataset demonstrates substantially improved accuracy, providing a novel and reliable source for global ecological studies. 
 Global change has substantially shifted vegetation phenology, with important implications in the carbon and water cycles of terrestrial ecosystems. Various vegetation phenology datasets have been developed using remote sensing data. However, the significant uncertainties in these datasets limit our understanding of ecosystem dynamics in terms of phenology. It is therefore crucial to generate a reliable large-scale vegetation phenology dataset, by fusing various existing vegetation phenology datasets, to provide a comprehensive and accurate estimation of vegetation phenology with a fine spatiotemporal resolution. In this study, we merged four widely used vegetation phenology datasets to generate a new dataset using the reliability ensemble averaging (REA) fusion method. The new dataset has a spatial resolution of 0.05° and covers the period from 1982 to 2020, with geographic coverage extending above 30° N in the Northern Hemisphere. The evaluation using ground-based phenocam data from 280 sites indicated that the accuracy of the newly merged dataset was substantially improved compared to the four original datasets. The start and end of the growing season (SOS and EOS) in the newly merged dataset showed the highest correlation with ground-based phenocam observations, compared to the original datasets (0.84 and 0.71, respectively) and accuracy in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) between phenocam data and merged datasets (12 and 17 d, respectively). Using the new dataset, we found that the SOS is occurring approximately 0.19 d earlier per year (p<0.01), while the end of the growing season is occurring 0.18 d later per year (p<0.01) over the period 1982–2020 across regions north of 30° N.

This comprehensive dataset offers valuable insights into energy, water, and CO2 fluxes, supporting research on land–atmosphere interactions and process models; fosters global collaboration; and advances research in environmental science and regional climate dynamics. 
 Eddy covariance observations play a pivotal role in understanding the land–atmosphere exchange of energy, water, carbon dioxide (CO2), and other trace gases, as well as the global carbon cycle and earth system. To promote the networking of individual measurements and the sharing of data, FLUXNET links regional networks of researchers studying land–atmosphere processes. JapanFlux was established in 2006 as a national branch of AsiaFlux. Despite the growing amount of shared data globally, the availability in Asia is currently limited. In this study, we developed an open dataset of the eddy covariance observations for Japan and East Asia, called JapanFlux2024, that was conducted by researchers affiliated with Japanese research institutions. The data were processed using selected standard methods from the FLUXNET community, with adaptations specific to the JapanFlux2024 dataset. Here, we present the data description and data processing and show the value of processed fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and CO2. The dataset will facilitate important studies for Japan and East Asia, such as land–atmosphere interactions, improvement of process models, and upscaling fluxes using machine learning and remote sensing technology, as well as bridge collaborations between Asia and FLUXNET."

It reveals regional and seasonal variations in turbulence, with stronger activity in spring and summer. The dataset supports weather forecasting, aviation safety, and low-altitude flight planning, aiding China's growing low-altitude economy, and is accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14959025. 
 Low-level atmospheric turbulence plays a critical role in cloud dynamics and aviation safety. Nevertheless, altitude-resolved turbulence profiles remain scarce, largely owing to observational challenges. By leveraging collocated radar wind profiler (RWP) and radiosonde observations from 29 stations across China in 2023, a high vertical resolution dataset of low-level turbulence-related parameters is generated based on the spectral width method. This dataset includes squared Brunt–Väisälä frequency (N2), turbulent dissipation rate (ε), vertical eddy diffusivity (K), inner scale (l0), and buoyancy length scale (LB), which are provided twice daily at 00:00 and 12:00 UTC with a vertical resolution of 120 m, covering altitudes from 0.12 to 3.0 km above ground level (a.g.l.). Spatial analysis reveals significant regional disparities in turbulence-related parameters across China, where ε, K, and LB are higher in northwest and north China compared to south China, while N2 and l0 display an inverse spatial pattern. These contrasting geographical distributions suggest distinct atmospheric instability across China. In terms of seasonality, turbulence-related variables showed maxima during spring and summer. Vertical profile characteristics show distinct altitudinal dependencies: ε, LB, and K exhibit progressive attenuation with altitude, while N2 and l0 increase with altitude. Statistical analysis indicates that ε and K follow log-normal distributions, whereas l0 and LB align with Gamma distributions. This dataset is publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14959025 (Meng and Guo, 2025) and provides crucial insights into the fine-scale structural evolution of low-level turbulence. The preliminary findings based on the dataset have great implications for improving our understanding of the pre-storm environment, conducting scientific planning, and guiding low-level flight routes in the emerging low-altitude economy in China."

 The continuous development of remote sensing techniques provides ample opportunities for high-resolution land-cover mapping. Although global 10 m land-cover products have made considerable progress over past few years, their simple classification system makes it difficult to meet the needs of diverse applications. In this work, we propose a hierarchical land-cover mapping framework to produce a novel global 10 m land-cover dataset with a fine classification system (called GLC_FCS10) using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series observations in 2023. First, the globally distributed training samples are hierarchically obtained from multisource prior products after applying a series of refinements. Then, a combination of hierarchical land-cover mapping, local adaptive modeling, and multisource features is used to produce land-cover maps for each 5×5 geographical tile. Next, using 56 121 globally distributed validation samples and a third-party validation dataset (LCMAP_Val), the GLC_FCS10 is assessed. The GLC_FCS10 achieves an overall accuracy of 83.16 % and a κ coefficient of 0.789 globally and an overall accuracy of 85.09 % in the United States. Meanwhile, comparisons with five released 10 or 30 m land-cover products also demonstrate that GLC_FCS10 has higher accuracy and captures more diverse land-cover information than three of the released global 10 m land-cover products. In summary, the novel GLC_FCS10 land-cover maps can provide important support for high-resolution land-cover-related research and applications. The GLC_FCS10 can be freely accessed via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14729665 (Liu and Zhang, 2025)."

We compared three products against 1,615 stations with more than 1.9 million measured moisture, finding ERA5-Land highly correlated but biased high, and SMAP-L4 accurate but short-term. Fusing them created an enhanced dataset, improving correlation by 5%, reducing errors by 20%, and enhancing overall fit by 15%. This seamless resource aids drought tracking, water planning, and climate adaptation. 
 Accurate, high-resolution soil moisture data are critical for hydrological modeling, climate studies, and ecosystem management. Unfortunately, current existing global products suffer from inconsistencies, coverage gaps, and biases. In this study, we evaluated the surface layers of three widely used soil moisture products, including ERA5-Land, ESA-CCI (v09.1 Combined), and SMAP L4 with resolutions ranging from 0.1° to 0.25°, against in situ measurements from 1,615 stations across five networks, including ISMN, CMA, Cemaden, COSMOS-Europe, and SONTE-China. The in situ dataset, to our knowledge, represents the most extensive global soil moisture compilation to date. It is found that ERA5-Land exhibits high correlation between measured and predicted soil moisture but the data also shows significant bias. SMAP L4 provides the highest accuracy, exhibiting low bias and root mean square error (RMSE), but is limited by its temporal coverage from 2015 to the present. To address these gaps, we developed an adjusted ERA5-Land dataset by fusing ERA5-Land and SMAP L4 using a mean-variance rescaling method optimized for long time-series alignment, which enhanced the spatiotemporal coverage and reduced bias. Validation against measured data demonstrates improved correlation with an increase correlation coefficient (r) of ~5 %, RMSE reduction of ~20 %, and NNSE improvement of ~15 % compared to the original products. The adjusted ERA5-Land dataset, which is publicly available, can be used as benchmark for future research and support drought monitoring, weather prediction, and water resource management, contributing to global climate resilience and informed decision-making across diverse ecosystems.

Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning models to integrate observations, and support in-depth analyses of carbon transport and storage mechanisms. This can foster broader utilization of Argo floats data in ocean carbon research. 
 The Southern Ocean plays a crucial role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and modulating the global oceanic carbon cycle, thereby substantially mitigating the effects of anthropogenic climate change. However, due to the region’s challenging environment and sparse observational coverage, large uncertainties remain regarding the magnitude and mechanisms of carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean. In recent decades, the deployment of Argo float arrays has facilitated autonomous and continuous profiling of hydrographic and biogeochemical properties from the surface to depths of up to 6,000 m, complementing traditional ship-based observations. Nevertheless, high-resolution, integrated datasets that combine ship-based and Argo-derived observations remain rare, partly due to the challenges of data harmonization, quality control, and uncertainty estimation, as well as the indirect nature of carbonate system parameter retrievals from Argo measurements. Here, we present a comprehensive, quality-controlled reconstruction of key carbonate system parameters in the Southern Ocean interior—including total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH (total scale), nitrate (NO3), phosphate (PO4), silicate (SiO4), anthropogenic carbon (Cant), and aragonite saturation (Ωar)—by leveraging machine learning techniques and integrating all available Argo float profiles with ship-based survey data. The resulting datasets are gridded at 1°×1° horizontal resolution and 84 vertical pressure levels (0–5,600 dbar), and are provided as distinct climatological products: the Float Grid (using all Argo float profiles) and the All-Data Grid (integrating all available Argo and ship-based observations). The Float Grid is further separated into the Non-O2-Float Grid (limited to Core Argo floats) and O2-Float Grid (limited to oxygen-measured Biogeochemical Argo floats). Each gridded product is accompanied by uncertainty estimates. The climatological products covers nearly the whole Sothern Ocean based on direct measurements instead of applying interpolating mapping methods, thereby providing a more robust result. Model performance is assessed through cross-comparison of Argo and shipboard measurements. The gridded products, collectively termed SOCOML (Southern Ocean CO2 Machine Learning products), are freely available for downloaded (doi: 10.17632/xzr59ngmpz.1) and are expected to support future studies of Southern Ocean carbon cycle."

Compared to the 10 m product, the sub-meter map achieved a 14.60% increase in overall accuracy, revealed a 57.73% discrepancy in spatial distribution, and detected 17 times more individual patches. The improved sensitivity to small patches significantly enhances early detection of Spartina alterniflora invasion. This finer mapping further refines soil carbon estimates and informs wetland management. 
 Current large-scale maps of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) with 10 m resolution hinder accurate delineation of community boundaries, detection of internal features such as creeks, and identification of small patches. These limitations further compromise the accuracy of spatial distribution extraction and subsequent analyzes. To this end, this study produced the first 2020 national-scale Sub-meter S. alterniflora Map of Mainland China (CM-SSM), using an Object- and Sub-meter-enhanced Pixel-based Phenological Feature (OSPPF) composite method. The method integrates phenological features from Sentinel-2 with spatial and textural details from Google Earth imagery, improving the spectral separability and mitigating mixed-pixel effects. Compared to the 10 m S. alterniflora product of Mainland China (CMSA), CM-SSM improved overall accuracy by 14.60 % and the F1 score by 0.21. Although the total mapped areas of CM-SSM (59,371 ha) and CMSA (58,006 ha) differ by only 1,365 ha, their spatial distributions diverge substantially. When benchmarked against CM-SSM, CMSA exhibited commission and omission errors totaling 34,273 ha (57.73 %). Moreover, the number of patches identified by CM-SSM (148,072) was over 17 times greater than that of CMSA, reflecting its superior capability in detecting fragmented distributions. In addition, Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) estimates derived from CM-SSM were 706.69 Gg (23.09 %) higher than those reported by the latest national SOC product, emphasizing the essential contribution of high-resolution mapping to accurate carbon accounting for S. alterniflora. These advances enhance understanding of S. alterniflora invasion dynamics, support carbon accounting, and inform evidence-based coastal wetland management and restoration.

We uncover that actual patterns are highly adaptable, yet by strategically allocating cereal grains across highways, railways, and waterways, transportation scenarios with reduced carbon emissions are possible.

This study developed a robust workflow using a fluorescent probe coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to identify CCRs in aquatic environments. Nine fluorescent probes were systematically evaluated, with 3-ap/BDP selected as the optimal probe due to its superior performance in detecting a wide range of model CCRs. The method demonstrated excellent linearity, minimal matrix interference, and high sensitivity, enabling the detection of CCRs at trace concentrations in complex environmental matrices. The workflow was applied to analyze CCRs generated in natural organic matter under solar irradiation and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). A total of 30 CCRs were identified, with distinct profiles observed between solar-irradiated and AOP-treated samples. Solar irradiation favored the formation of CCRs with higher m/z values, while AOPs generated CCRs with lower m/z values, highlighting the influence of reactive species on CCR formation. These findings provide critical insights into the environmental behavior of CCRs in aquatic environments. Moreover, the developed workflow offers a powerful tool for monitoring CCRs in natural and engineered water systems. ."

This study establishes a national PM2.5 OP database (2000–2020) using a source-oriented CMAQ model. Key findings reveal that OP decreases alongside PM2.5 concentrations over the study period, but the decline in OP (16%) is less pronounced than that of PM2.5 (37%) after 2012, leading to a 35% increase in mass-normalized OP (OPm). Source apportionment analysis identifies distinct phase-specific drivers: anthropogenic secondary organic aerosols (ASOA) were the dominant contributor to OP increases (∼68%) prior to 2012, while reductions in transportation, power generation, and biomass burning emissions drove OP declines during 2012–2017. Post-2017, stringent controls on anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs)  made ASOA the dominant declining source. Notably, urban-rural disparities in OP exposure exceed those of PM2.5 mass concentrations, primarily reflecting differences in dominant emission sources.

While conventional air filtration can capture bioaerosols, it poses risks of re-emitting pathogens, necessitating long-term air sterilization. Here, we developed a photo-regenerable antimicrobial air filter by grafting Cu clusters onto a titanium dioxide nanotube mesh (CuxO/mTNT, 1 < x < 2). The in situ grown tubular nanotubes on the mesh support provide a high surface area, and the dispersed Cu clusters exhibited superior disinfection activity. The filter achieved rapid inactivation of Gram-negative Escherichia coli (4.80-log reduction) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (2.58-log reduction) and respiratory viruses including Influenza A virus (H1N1) and Human coronavirus 229E within minutes. While Cu-based nanomaterials induce antimicrobial effects through direct contact, they gradually lose efficiency as Cu(I) species oxidize to Cu(II). When Cu clusters are grafted onto TiO2, the interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) allows for the absorption of visible light and the formation of charge carriers. The Cu clusters dispersed onto the TNT continuously regenerate Cu(I) under mild visible light through IFCT, achieving sustained recovery of the antimicrobial efficiency. Integrated into a commercial air purifier, the CuxO/mTNT filter achieved efficient space disinfection of bioaerosols, showed reversible photo-regeneration over 10 cycles, and maintained durability for over six months.

Eight novel tri-OPEs and three OPEtps species were identified for the first time in this region. Aryl-OPEs dominated both targets and suspects, particularly tris(2,4-ditertbutylphenyl) phosphate and its diester product, attributed to their high hydrophobicity and widespread industrial use. Di-OPEs were the primary OPEtps detected, whereas HO-OPEs, typically found in the biota, were rare in sediments. For traditional OPEs in surface sediments, the mean Σ12tri-OPE concentration (10.6 ng/g dw) significantly exceeded Σ7OPEtps (0.9 ng/g dw), reflecting slower formation, lower sediment affinity of OPEtps, and continuous tri-OPE input. Different vertical distribution trends were found for Σ12tri-OPEs and Σ7OPEtps in two sediment cores, with a significant positive correlation between TPHP and DPHP, supporting degradation-driven temporal variations.

The synthesis is enabled by forming amorphous metal–organic coordination composites between histidine and atomically mixed metal ions, which are thermally converted to hierarchically porous amorphous Mn2O3 due to the Ce/C doping in the Mn2O3 skeleton and the self-bubbling and reductive roles of histidine.

Using nontargeted and targeted metabolomics, we systematically profiled plasma metabolite alterations to elucidate potential metabolic disruptions, toxic mechanisms, and metabolic signatures. Molecular docking was used to examine the binding activity of BPs and their metabolic transformation products (MTPs) with hormone receptors, revealing potential links between biotransformation and metabolic disruption. We found that metabolic indices like cholesterol were vulnerable to BPs exposure. Exposure to bisphenol AF (BPAF), BPB, and BPAP significantly altered 554, 391, and 236 metabolites, respectively, with kynurenine and histidine identified as common metabolic signatures. Histidine/kynurenine ratio (AUC: 0.937, ACC: 0.820) exhibited superior predictive ability for distinguishing BPs exposure compared to either histidine or kynurenine alone, serving as promising biomarkers for rapid toxic evaluation of emerging BPs.

Notably, a larger fraction of mmFPs, particularly Fe-rich FPs, were associated with toxic metals (e.g., Mn and Pb) on clean days than on polluted days. Lung cytotoxic potencies, including oxidative stress and cytotoxicity, were up to 8.1 and 6.3 times greater on clean days than on polluted days. Fe-rich FPs and their associated toxic metals were identified as first-tier factors in regulating cytotoxic potency, playing a more critical role than organic/elemental carbon and dissolved metals.

If uncorrected, these biases can distort inverse analyses of satellite methane column observations (e.g., GOSAT), which encompass contributions from both the troposphere and the stratosphere, and lead to erroneous estimates of surface emissions and tropospheric sinks. To overcome this limitation and advance methane modeling, we developed and evaluated several novel bias correction approaches (e.g., empirically derived polynomial correction, age‐of‐air proxy correction, and offline correction by replacing the stratospheric fields with observations). Crucially, we implemented the first online correction by assimilating independent satellite observations (e.g., ACE‐FTS and MIPAS), dynamically accounting for interannual variabilities and stratosphere‐troposphere exchange (STE) processes. These innovative methods yield significant quantitative improvements: correcting for stratospheric biases on average resulted in a 22‐Tg a−1 increase in inferred global methane emissions from GOSAT data, but with notable differences among methods (3–54 Tg a−1). The correction increased extratropical emissions by 47 (26–101) Tg a−1 but decreased tropical emissions by 24 (11–47) Tg a−1, highlighting a substantial impact on regional emission apportionment. Our results also indicate that stratospheric biases can distort tropospheric simulation through STE, potentially affecting the analysis of surface methane observations.

To explore the uncertainties arising from this disparity, this study focuses on 137Cs, released during the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, as a species with numerous observations compared to other radionuclides and minimal interference from other factors using the NAQPMS model incorporating a physically‐based wet deposition module. A diagnostic convective cloud scheme was applied, using a radar composite reflectivity factor (RCRF) of 35 dBZ to identify convective precipitation. Implementing the RCRF diagnosis scheme significantly improved model performance by increasing in‐cloud deposition.

Analog pairs of 24‐hr weak‐ and moderate‐VWS cases are selected to isolate VWS effects, minimizing differences in other factors that can influence TC size. All results presented are based on these analog cases. The azimuthally averaged size expansion is significantly larger in moderate‐VWS cases than in weak‐VWS ones, with a slight positive correlation between expansion and VWS magnitude in the former. Composite analysis in a shear‐relative, radius‐normalized framework reveals that weak‐VWS cases primarily experience downshear wind field expansion, whereas moderate‐VWS cases exhibit expansion both downshear and upshear. The upshear expansion is key to the greater overall size increase under moderate VWS and is linked to enhanced upshear convection and shear‐induced surface wind asymmetry. Under moderate VWS, the upshear convection development is a typical response to vortex tilting and is accompanied by intensified low‐level radial inflow, particularly in the upshear‐left quadrant, which can facilitate radial momentum import. Furthermore, a stronger tangential momentum gradient—caused by higher wind speeds left of shear and lower speeds right of shear—supports increased tangential momentum advection into upshear quadrants, reinforcing upshear wind field expansion. Preliminary thermodynamic analysis highlights elevated surface latent heat flux (LHF) on the left‐of‐shear side as a key factor in upshear convection development. A positive feedback among surface wind speed, LHF, and convection further supports upshear convection development in moderate‐VWS cases."

Wright;Mengqian Lu,A Generalized Lagrangian Attribution Tool for Hydrometeorological Extremes,"We introduce a novel generalized Lagrangian attribution tool for hydrometeorological extremes (LATHE) designed to trace the origins and processes that contribute to moisture and heat (i.e., specific enthalpy) anomalies. The approach is based on a strict conceptual framework in which the influences of turbulent evaporation and sensible heat fluxes are separated from the effects of latent heat release and radiative cooling by the boundary layer top. In its default form, LATHE distinguishes sensible heating, latent heating (assigned to where conversion takes place), and conversion from upstream moisture (assigned to the initial evaporative source) as contributions to anomalous atmospheric heat content, along with a standard moisture source algorithm. This procedure can be applied flexibly to a wide range of moist thermodynamic metrics. We apply LATHE to two extreme events, one extreme precipitation event and one severe heatwave, to demonstrate the added information relative to traditional analyses. We then conduct a series of sensitivity tests to identify key parameters, missing pieces, and sources of uncertainty. The results highlight the importance of shallow convection acting to deepen the moisture source (by venting humid air from the boundary layer) and intensify sensible heating in the boundary layer (by enhancing entrainment), leading us to propose an extension to the conceptual model. Finally, we note that many key uncertainties are intrinsic not to the method itself but to the reanalysis products we rely on to apply it. To make best use of LATHE and similar tools, we will need to confront these uncertainties directly."

We describe the latest sea‐level projections designed to help the Netherlands adapt to climate change. To improve on previous projections, we develop here a framework that allows a better connection between observed sea‐level changes and projections. First, a sea‐level budget provides an attribution of observed sea level to its contributors. This budget is applied to the same region as the projections. Second, the projections start in 1995 allowing a long overlapping period with observations, which allows an evaluation of the projections for total sea level and for each individual contributor. The framework helps identify issues in a former version of process‐based sea‐level projections and guides decision making to avoid them in this and future updates. In particular, we decide to select plausible climate models for ocean dynamic sea‐level change. The resulting sea‐level rise median and 5th to 95th percentile ranges in 2100 compared to 1995–2014 are 44 (26–73) cm, 59 (40–95) cm and 82 (59–124) cm for the SSP1‐2.5, SSP2‐4.5 an SSP5‐8.5 emissions scenarios respectively.

We used a stochastic modeling system to project future areal extents of mature and old‐growth forests on National Forest System (NFS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land across the conterminous United States, and to assess threats to these forests under a variety of socioeconomic and climate futures, to 2070. The area of old‐growth forest is expected to increase 19%–27% on NFS and BLM lands while mature forest trends (0.8% decrease to 2.5% increase) depend on the socioeconomic and climate future. Trends vary regionally, with old‐growth area increasing everywhere but the South, where it is projected to remain approximately the same, while the area of mature forest remains relatively flat everywhere but the Pacific Northwest, where an increase is expected. Old growth is projected to increase for most major forest types while mature forest increases for some and decreases for others. The volume of trees killed by fire annually is projected to increase by as much as 48% for old‐growth and 22%–100% for mature forests, while harvested volume could increase by 367%–441% in old‐growth and 125%–150% in mature forests under some scenarios. Fire and cutting would cause only a small proportional decrease in overall tree volume, however. By identifying the ecosystems susceptible to loss of older forest, these results can inform management and conservation efforts to retain such forests and help them adapt to future change."

 The establishment of the vertebrate body plan is orchestrated by the organizer, a specialized group of cells with inductive properties that guide axial specification during early development. In avian embryos, organizer cells reside within Hensen’s node, a transient structure located at the tip of the primitive streak. Despite its pivotal role during gastrulation, the cellular architecture of the Hensen’s node remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Hensen’s node is composed of two transcriptionally and functionally distinct organizer populations. In addition to anterior GSC-expressing cells associated with head induction, we identify a posterior population co-expressing organizer and mesodermal genes. These posterior cells exhibit trunk-inducing activity when transplanted into naïve tissue. Our findings reveal that the organizer is a dynamic and spatially compartmentalized structure, and that temporal changes in the relative abundance of anterior and posterior populations underlie shifts in its inductive capacity, ensuring coordinated patterning along the body axis.

 Terpene cyclases catalyze exquisite and complicated cyclization reactions to generate diverse terpenoid skeletons. Trichoderma fungi are important biocontrol agents, characteristic of producing complex bioactive tetracyclic diterpenoids named harzianes and trichodermanins, but their biosynthesis and biological functions have long been enigmatic. Here we identify TriDTCs, an unprecedented family of terpene cyclases in Trichoderma, responsible for cyclizing geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into major diterpenes harzianol I and wickerol A, via heterologous expressions, gene deletion, and in vitro assays. TriDTCs represent a brand new class of terpene cyclases, lacking known motifs and diverging from all known enzymes. Mechanistically, TriDTCs likely employ a unique DxxDxxxD aspartate triad for cyclization initiation, a critical valine residue modulating product specificity, and “gatekeeper” residues for activity. Phylogenetic analysis shows TriDTCs have a narrow distribution in three fungal genera and are highly functionally specific within Trichoderma, suggesting a genus-specific acquisition and independent evolution. Functional studies implicated TriDTCs in fungal survival strategies by regulating formation of resistant propagules (chlamydospore in Trichoderma, sclerotia in Aspergillus oryzae). These findings expand the knowledge of terpene cyclase diversity and biological significance, herald a strategy to enhance Trichoderma’s biocontrol efficacy, and open avenues for pharmacological investigation of these diterpenoids.

 Chiral purity is crucial in life sciences, emphasizing the importance of precise enantiomeric identification and the development of analytical techniques. Here, we design functional dyes with visual chiral recognition capabilities by introducing recognition units 2-amino-1,2-diphenylethanol into vibration-induced emission molecules. The unambiguous differentiation in luminescent colors upon binding to enantiomers facilitates the efficient recognition of enantiomers and the analysis of enantiomeric excess. The chiral recognition process originates from co-assembly under charge-aided hydrogen bonding interactions, which is significantly impacted by the steric hindrance effect, and further affects the planarization of the excited state conformation of the dye. This co-assembly process precisely amplifies the dynamics at the molecular level into macroscopic observable signals for real-time, highly sensitive recognition. Furthermore, we establish a sophisticated optical analysis system by correlating Red-Green-Blue values and CIE coordinates to analyze the enantiomeric excess of chiral molecules. This work opens a distinct avenue for visual chiral recognition and inspires the development of advanced optical materials in chiral sensing chemistry.

 Clathrin-mediated endocytosis depends on complex protein interactions.

We find that the EH domains exhibit binding promiscuity, recognizing not only the NPF motif of Dab2 but also other phenylalanine containing motifs. This promiscuity enables interactions with Eps15’s own IDR (Eps15IDR), which lacks NPF motifs, suggesting a self-inhibitory state that promotes liquid-liquid phase separation. Despite competing for the same EH domain binding sites, Eps15IDR and Dab2320-495 can bind EH123 simultaneously, forming a highly dynamic interaction network that facilitates the recruitment of Dab2320-495 into Eps15 condensates. Our findings provide molecular insights into the competitive interactions shaping the early stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Eps15, a protein involved in endocytosis initiation, uses small folded EH domains to bind disordered partner proteins and its own disordered tail, thus forming a dynamic network via phase separation that may help organize early endocytic events."

 Using more renewable energy to make exported goods helps reduce carbon emissions from global trade. However, current global trade databases often lack precise data on how much renewable energy is used to produce traded goods, limiting insights into how this is changing over time. To address this gap, we develop a renewable energy featured final energy account (RE-FEA) that quantifies final energy (electricity and non-electric energy products) directly consumed by end-use sectors. This dataset covers 145 countries, 163 sectors and annual data from 2011 to 2022. From the dataset, we estimate that the share of renewable energy embodied in exports over total embodied energy rose from 8% to 13% over the period. Cleaner energy exports are concentrated among high-income and upper-middle income countries and in light industry and material manufacturing. This dataset fills gaps in current Multi-Regional Input–Output data and can improve the understanding of how global trade impacts sustainability.

 Mantle peridotite, which is also present in near-surface environments, reacts readily with CO2, and is expected to be suitable for CO2 mineralization. However, the low permeability and porosity of mantle peridotite, in addition to its volume changes during carbonation remain major obstacles to large-scale CO2 mineralization. Here we propose a coupled ex-situ and in-situ CO2 mineralization approach employing biobased and biodegradable chelating agents. This involves the injection of an acidic chelating agent to enhance the permeability and porosity, along with divalent metal ion extraction to achieve ex-situ CO2 mineralization on the surface (stage 1). Subsequently, an alkaline chelating agent is employed for CO2 capture, injection, and enhanced in-situ mineralization (stage 2). This study experimentally demonstrated a substantial permeability enhancement and Mg-Fe cation extraction by chelating agents, a crucial process of stage 1. The injection of acidic chelating agents leads to the formation of prominent wormholes, resulting in a 21-fold increase in permeability within ~20 minutes, indicating the potential to enhance the injectivity and CO2 mineralization capacity of peridotite.

 Regressions are commonly used in environmental science and economics to identify causal or associative relationships between variables. In these settings, remote sensing-derived map products increasingly serve as sources of variables, enabling estimation of effects such as the impact of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and — because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs — errors are difficult to characterize. Thus, population-level estimators from such maps may be biased. In this paper, we apply prediction-powered inference (PPI) to estimate regression coefficients relating a response variable and covariates to each other. PPI is a method that estimates parameters of interest by using a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data to correct for bias in large-scale remote sensing map products. Applying PPI across multiple remote sensing use cases in regression coefficient estimation, we find that it results in estimates that are (1) more reliable than using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and (2) have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth sample data and ignoring the map product. Empirically, we observe effective sample size increases of up to 17-fold using PPI compared to only using ground truth data. This is the first work to estimate remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors.

 Earth observation satellites play a crucial role in disaster response and management, offering timely and large-scale data for damage assessment. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning techniques for automated building damage detection from satellite imagery, often based on the xBD dataset. This high-quality dataset features bi-temporal very-high-resolution image pairs of several disaster events. Notably, several studies have proposed new network architectures and demonstrated their improved performance on xBD. Although such highly engineered model-centric approaches achieve promising results on the original dataset split of xBD, we show that they underperform on a new event-based split, which evaluates them on unseen events. To reduce this generalization gap, we propose to follow a data-centric approach. For this, we first derive a simplified baseline method from the winning solution of the xView2 competition, with greatly reduced complexity. With a simple adjustment to this baseline method, we incorporate readily available disaster-type information, allowing it to account for disaster-specific damage characteristics. We evaluate the resulting disaster-adaptive model on the event-based split of xBD and demonstrate its improved ability to generalize to unseen events compared to several competing methods. These results highlight the potential of our data-centric approach for practical and robust building damage assessment in real-world disaster scenarios.

 Biodiversity decline due to global change poses a pressing challenge for conservation efforts worldwide. To improve the efficiency of conservation projects, spatially explicit information on species richness is needed, yet this information is challenging to generate from traditional biodiversity assessments. To fill this gap, we here explored the potential of spaceborne remote sensing techniques, including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and EnMAP, for mapping species richness across four distinct taxonomic groups (fungi, plants, insects and birds) in a complex mountain landscape in the German Alps. We used all sensors individually, as well as different combinations of data (Sentinel-1/2, EnMAP/Sentinel-1/2), and compared predictions to predictions based on LiDAR data – a well-proven standard in mapping species richness. Our results showed that a combination of EnMAP/Sentinel-1/2 performed as well or even better than airborne LiDAR data for predicting species richness, but predictive accuracies of individual spaceborne models were substantially lower. This suggests that optical, radar and hyperspectral data carry complementary information and combining this information unleashes the full potential of spaceborne data for species richness mapping. However, validating models by habitat type revealed higher errors within habitat types (i.e., forest or open habitat), especially for immobile species (fungi and plants) that likely vary at smaller spatial scales than the resolution of the spaceborne systems used in this study. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of spaceborne remote sensing for large-scale biodiversity assessments, offering valuable insights into spatial biodiversity patterns and their changes over time."

However, most existing optical components have rigid spectral functionalities with limited tunability, hindering compact and fast optical spectral shaping. We introduce a pixelated nano-opto-electro-mechanical (NOEM) grating that exploits electromechanically induced symmetry breaking for precise, pixel-level control of grating coupling strength, yielding a miniaturized (~0.007 square millimeters) on-chip spectral shaper. We demonstrate the synthesis of grating pixels for arbitrary spectral responses, and we achieved rapid (<10 nanoseconds), high-contrast (>100 decibels), wavelength-selective switching through collective, nanometer-scale electrostatic perturbations. Our pixelated NOEM grating delivers exceptional spectral manipulation capabilities in an ultracompact, on-chip manner, offering prospects for next-generation optical information networks, computing architectures, and beyond."

We show that the fan’s directional stiffness enables fast, passive elastocapillary morphing, independent of muscle input. This flat-ribbon fan balances collapsibility during leg recovery with rigidity during drag-based propulsion, enabling full-body 96° turns in 50 milliseconds, with forward speeds of up to 120 body lengths per second—on par with fruit fly saccades in air. Drawing from this morphofunctional architecture, we engineered a 1-milligram elastocapillary fan integrated into an insect-scale robot. Experiments with both insects and robots confirmed that self-morphing fans improve thrust, braking, and maneuverability. Our findings link fan microstructure to controlled interfacial propulsion and establish design principles for compact, elastocapillary actuators in agile aquatic microrobots."

However, the mechanisms of defense remain unclear. The Retron-Septu system integrates retron and Septu antiphage defenses. Cryo–electron microscopy structures reveal asymmetric nucleoprotein complexes comprising a reverse transcriptase, msDNA (a hybrid of msdDNA and msrRNA), and two PtuAB copies. msdDNA and msrRNA are essential for assembling this complex, with msrRNA adopting a conserved lariat-like structure that regulates reverse transcription. Notably, the assembled Retron-Septu complex is inactive, with msdDNA occupying the PtuA DNA binding site. Activation occurs upon disassembly, releasing PtuAB, which degrades single-stranded DNA to restrict phage replication. This “arrest-and-release” mechanism underscores the dynamic regulatory roles of msDNA, advancing our understanding of antiphage defense strategies."

It can suppress polariton delocalization by disrupting molecular coherence–limiting polariton-modified properties. We investigated how energy disorders affect vibrational polariton dynamics by probing ultrafast dynamics in 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol in liquids (inhomogeneous) and solids (homogeneous) using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. In liquids, energy disorder disrupted delocalization, preventing vibrational energy transfer. By contrast, with reduced inhomogeneity, vibrational strong coupling in solids restored delocalization and enabled energy transfer. We established a stringent delocalization criterion, requiring collective coupling strengths exceeding three times inhomogeneous linewidths to sustain polariton coherence. This finding highlights energy disorder’s detrimental effects and outlines strategies to overcome localization—either by minimizing disorder through chemical control or by achieving sufficient couplings using advanced photonic structures."

Nonetheless, its causal role in emotion regulation is unknown. We discovered that inactivating dlPFC area 46 in marmosets blunts appetitive motivation and heightens threat reactivity. The effects were asymmetric—dependent on the left hemisphere only—and were mediated through projections to pregenual cingulate area 32. The antidepressant ketamine blocked the appetitive motivational deficits through mechanisms within subcallosal cingulate area 25, an area linked with treatment success in dlPFC noninvasive stimulation.

Here, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–anchored lipid transfer protein PDZ domain–containing 8 (PDZD8), which we propose to be renamed as lysosomal vacuolator (LYVAC), is a general mediator of lysosomal vacuolation. Using human cell lines, we found that diverse lysosomal vacuolation inducers converged on lysosomal osmotic stress, triggering LYVAC recruitment through multivalent interactions. Stress-induced lysosomal lipid signaling contributed to both the recruitment and activation of LYVAC. By directly sensing lysosomal phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, the lipid transfer domain of LYVAC mediated directional ER-to-lysosome lipid movement, leading to osmotic membrane expansion of lysosomes.

We used a global acoustic dataset of more than 60 million detections, representing 583 diurnal bird species, to synthesize effects of light pollution on avian vocalization. On average, light pollution prolonged vocal activity by 50 min. Light pollution responses were strongest for species with large eyes, open nests, migratory habits, and large ranges and during the breeding season. Prolonged activity may confer negative, neutral, or positive fitness effects; documenting these fitness effects and curbing light pollution are challenges for 21st-century conservation."

Although thalamocortical circuit dysfunction has been implicated in these symptoms, its precise roles in ASD pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the specific contribution of the reticular thalamic nucleus (RT), a key modulator of thalamocortical activity, to ASD-related behavioral deficits using aCntnap2knockout mouse model.Cntnap2−/−mice displayed increased seizure susceptibility, locomotor activity, and repetitive behaviors. Electrophysiological recordings revealed enhanced intrathalamic oscillations and burst firing in RT neurons, accompanied by elevated T-type calcium currents. In vivo fiber photometry confirmed behavior-associated increases in RT population activity. Notably, pharmacological and chemogenetic suppression of RT excitability via Z944, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and via C21 activation of the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di significantly improved ASD-related behaviors. These findings identify RT hyperexcitability as a mechanistic driver of ASD and highlight RT as a potential therapeutic target."
