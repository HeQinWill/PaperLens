10.1088/1748-9326/adb984,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注亚马逊地区次生林对气候的影响，包括碳吸收和非碳气候效益。论文讨论了利用遥感技术监测森林覆盖变化，以及利用地面测量数据了解次生林在气候系统中的作用。研究还涉及次生林面临的威胁，如火灾，以及如何通过森林恢复来减缓气候变化。虽然提到了遥感技术，但重点在于森林生态系统和气候变化，而不是大气环境遥感技术的具体应用，例如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。,"['carbon sequestration', 'remote sensing (forest cover change)', 'climate modeling', 'forest fires']",Jessica C A Baker;Marcos Adami;Celso H L Silva-Junior;Luis W R Sadeck;Callum Smith;Viola H A Heinrich;Jos Barlow;Joice Ferreira;Henrique L G Cassol;Liana O Anderson;Celso Von Randow;Arthur P K Argles;Rita C S Von Randow;Fernando Elias;Luiz E O C Aragão;Stephen Sitch;Dominick V Spracklen,Climate benefits of Amazon secondary forests—recent advances and research needs,"A quarter of the deforested Amazon has regrown as secondary tropical forest and yet the climatic importance of these complex regenerating landscapes is only beginning to be recognised. Advances in satellite remote-sensing have transformed our ability to detect and map changes in forest cover, while detailed ground-based measurements from permanent monitoring plots and eddy-covariance flux towers are providing new insights into the role of secondary forests in the climate system. This review summarises how progress in data availability on Amazonian secondary forests has led to better understanding of their influence on global, regional and local climate through carbon and non-carbon climate benefits. We discuss the climate implications of secondary forest disturbance and the progress in representing forest regrowth in climate models. Much remains to be learned about how secondary forests function and interact with climate, how these processes change with forest age, and the resilience of secondary forest ecosystems faced with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Secondary forests face numerous threats: half of secondary forests in the Brazilian legal Amazon were 11 years old or younger in 2023. On average, 1%–2% of Amazon secondary forests burn each year, threatening the permanence of sequestered carbon. The forests that burn are predominantly young (in 2023, 55% of burned secondary forests were <6 years old, <4% were over 30 years old). In the context of legally binding international climate treaties and a rapidly changing political backdrop, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of encouraging tropical forest restoration to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Amazon secondary forests could make a valuable contribution to Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contribution provided there are robust systems in place to ensure permanence. We consider how to improve communication between scientists and decision-makers and identify pressing areas of future research."
10.1088/1748-9326/adba01,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注通过平流层气溶胶注入（SAI）来缓解北极地区气候变暖的问题。论文设计并模拟了一个在后勤方面受限的北极地区SAI方案，并使用能源百亿亿次地球系统模型（E3SM）进行模拟。研究结果表明，北极地区SAI可以降低北半球温度并减缓海冰融化，但也可能对水文循环产生影响。虽然该研究涉及大气中的气溶胶，但其重点在于气候工程和气候模型，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Stratospheric Aerosol Injection', 'Climate Modeling', 'Climate Change Mitigation', 'Arctic Climate', 'E3SM Model']",Lauren Wheeler;Benjamin Wagman;Wake Smith;Peter Davies;Ben Cook;Sarah Brunell;Andrew Glen;Diana Hackenburg;Jessica Lien;Lyndsay Shand;Todd Zeitler,"Design and simulation of a logistically constrained high-latitude, low-altitude stratospheric aerosol injection scenario in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)","The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the globe, posing risks to climate tipping elements such as the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, winter Arctic sea ice loss, weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, and permafrost collapse. Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) has shown potential to ameliorate these effects by reducing surface temperatures. Due to the potential for an asymmetric hemispheric response in precipitation, Arctic-only SAI is not recommended. Given the challenges associated with an Antarctic SAI program, including the lack of nearby large airports, however, we designed and simulated an Arctic-only logistically constrained SAI scenario, considering limitations imposed by factors affecting the planning, execution, and management of operations. Our scenario is constrained by aircraft development and delivery timelines. SAI deployment begins in 2032 and increases to a maximum annual injection of 6.7 TgSO2 by 2053 through 2070. The scenario is simulated in a modified version of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model. Results indicate that Arctic-only SAI can reduce Northern Hemisphere temperatures and slow sea ice loss, though the early years of deployment may show limited cooling due to low ramp-in injection magnitudes. The Arctic-only SAI introduces minimal impact on Southern Hemisphere (SH) temperatures but significant shifts in the hydrologic cycle, particularly around the equator. SH changes are low within the first two decades, suggesting that asymmetries in Arctic-only SAI deployment could be sustained without severe adverse climate impacts for the first couple of decades. These asymmetries matter given the challenges associated with an Antarctic SAI program. Our findings underscore the necessity of incorporating logistical constraints on deployment and the need for multi-model assessments in the evaluation of polar SAI scenarios. This approach would ensure a strong scientific understanding of polar SAI and facilitates policy and decision-maker understanding of the risks and benefits of SAI."
10.1088/1748-9326/adbd56,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注全球地表气温的年代际变化趋势，以及不同海域海表温度对其的影响。虽然地表气温与大气环境相关，但该研究并未直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析，而是侧重于气候变化和海洋-大气相互作用。,[],Yidan Xu;Jianping Li;Jiaxu Guo;Jing Sun;Shuai Deng;Haohuan Fu;Lanning Wang;Wei Xue,Modulation of the interdecadal trend of global surface air temperature by sea surface temperature over multiple ocean basins,"Since the 20th century, accompanied by a long-term warming trend, the global surface air temperature (SAT) has exhibited distinct interdecadal oscillations. The period from 1910 to 2012 can be divided into four phases, including two rapid warming (1910–1945 and 1975–1998) and two warming slowdown (1940–1975 and 1998–2012) periods. This study explores the spatiotemporal characteristics of the interdecadal trends in global SAT under the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) on a multi-basin scale. Here, we have accumulated the numerical simulated SAT anomalies under the forcing of historical SST in the selected ocean basins. The results indicate that multi-basin SSTs collectively govern the spatiotemporal variations and interdecadal trends of SATs during rapid warming periods. SSTs in the Indian Ocean, North Atlantic, and western Pacific can affect the spatiotemporal interdecadal trends of SAT during 1940–1975. SSTs in the eastern tropical Pacific and North Pacific can modify the SAT spatiotemporal trends during 1998–2012. Considering the nonlinear interactions between different oceanic regions, the SAT forced by the collective SSTs in the six ocean basins shows high consistency with observation. This indicates that the combined effects of SSTs in the six ocean basins are key reasons for global SAT interdecadal change in 1910–2012."

The eastern Mediterranean is a hotspot for aerosols with natural and anthropogenic contributions. We present lidar measurements performed during A-LIFE (Absorbing aerosol layers in a changing climate: aging, lifetime and dynamics) to characterize aerosols and aerosol mixtures. We extend current lidar classification and separation schemes and compare them to classification schemes using different methods. 
 Aerosols are key players in Earth's climate system, with mineral dust being a major component of the atmospheric aerosol load. While former campaigns focused on investigating the properties and effects of layers of rather pure mineral dust, the A-LIFE (Absorbing aerosol layers in a changing climate: aging, lifetime and dynamics) campaign in April 2017 aimed to characterize dust in complex aerosol mixtures. In this study we present ground-based lidar measurements that were performed at Limassol, Cyprus, in April 2017. During our measurement period, the measurement site was affected by complex mixtures of dust from different sources and pollution aerosols from local as well as long-range transported sources. Considering the lidar measurements from two ground-based systems, POLIS (portable lidar system) and PollyXT (portable lidar system with extended capabilities). We found mean values and mean systematic errors (standard deviation, SD, given in brackets) of the particle linear depolarization ratio and extinction-to-backscatter ratio (lidar ratio) of 0.26 ± 0.03 (SD of 0.02) and 41 ± 5 sr (SD of 3 sr) at 355 nm and of 0.29 ± 0.02 (SD of 0.02) and 38 ± 5 sr (SD of 6 sr) at 532 nm for Arabian dust and of 0.26 ± 0.03 (SD of 0.03) and 55 ± 8 sr (SD of 6 sr) at 355 nm and of 0.28 ± 0.02 (SD of 0.01) and 54 ± 8 sr (SD of 8 sr) at 532 nm for Saharan dust. The values found for pollution aerosols of the particle linear depolarization ratio and the lidar ratio are 0.06 ± 0.02 (SD of 0.04) and 64 ± 13 sr (SD of 5 sr) at 355 nm and of 0.04 ± 0.02 (SD of 0.01) and 64 ± 12 sr (SD of 4 sr) at 532 nm, respectively. We use our measurements for aerosol typing and compare them to aerosol typing from sun photometer data, in situ measurements, and trajectory analysis. The different methods agree well for the derived aerosol type, but looking at the derived dust mass concentration from different methods, the trajectory analysis frequently underestimates high dust concentrations that were found in major mineral dust events."
10.5194/acp-25-3213-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注撒哈拉沙尘暴对伊比利亚半岛的辐射影响，特别是细颗粒物和粗颗粒物沙尘的短波直接辐射效应。研究利用伊比利亚半岛的激光雷达站监测数据，并结合全球大气模型进行辐射传输模拟。论文创新之处在于分别模拟细沙尘和粗沙尘的影响，并将其结果与直接模拟总沙尘的结果进行比较。研究结果表明，细沙尘对地表和大气顶部的短波直接辐射效应贡献显著，并且在高沙尘环境下，考虑沙尘粒径分离可能更准确地评估沙尘的冷却效应。此外，研究还提到了沙尘对卫星辐射测量的影响，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Saharan dust', 'dust direct radiative effect (DRE)', 'short-wave (SW) radiation', 'lidar', 'aerosol-induced cooling', 'fine dust (Df)', 'coarse dust (Dc)', 'satellite instrumentation']",María-Ángeles López-Cayuela;Carmen Córdoba-Jabonero;Michaël Sicard;Jesús Abril-Gago;Vanda Salgueiro;Adolfo Comerón;María José Granados-Muñoz;Maria João Costa;Constantino Muñoz-Porcar;Juan Antonio Bravo-Aranda;Daniele Bortoli;Alejandro Rodríguez-Gómez;Lucas Alados-Arboledas;Juan Luis Guerrero-Rascado,Fine and coarse dust radiative impact during an intense Saharan dust outbreak over the Iberian Peninsula – short-wave direct radiative effect,"Due to the significant radiative role of dust in climate change, vertical assessments of the short-wave dust direct radiative effect of both fine and coarse dust particles are performed separately. The study is focused on an intense Saharan dust outbreak crossing the Iberian Peninsula in springtime monitored by five Iberian lidar stations with southwest–northeast coverage. A comparative study to evaluate the differences found by considering the total dust (no separation) is also examined. 
 Mineral dust has a key role in the Earth's radiative balance, and it has become significant over the Iberian Peninsula (IP), where Saharan dust outbreaks have seemed to increase in frequency and intensity. This study quantifies the dust direct radiative effect (DRE) in the short-wave range (SW) during an intense persistent springtime dust episode over the IP. In particular, the vertical distribution of dust optical properties was derived at five lidar stations, and the Global Atmospheric Model (GAME) was used for radiative transfer simulations. Moreover, this study innovates by simulating the SW DRE using two distinct methodologies. The novel approach separates the impacts of fine (Df) and coarse (Dc) dust components and calculates the total DRE as their combined sum. In contrast, the commonly used approach directly simulates the DRE for the total dust. Along the dust pathway crossing the IP, the SW DRE consistently registered a pattern of aerosol-induced cooling at both the surface, i.e the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA), and top of the atmosphere (TOA). Results reveal that the role of Df must be highlighted, as Df particles contributed nearly half of the total SW DRE at BOA and TOA, particularly for this event. DRE simulations based on the separation of dust modes for solar zenith angles < 70° show that nearly 75 % of DRE values are lower (in absolute value) with respect to those obtained by considering the total dust. That is, a less pronounced cooling effect is observed overall when the separation of dust modes is taken into account, although relative differences between approaches are not highly significant in general (−3 % and −6 % on average at BOA and TOA, respectively). However, this behaviour reverses under moderate-to-high-dust conditions when the contributions of the Dc and Df components are considered separately; i.e. dust induces a more pronounced cooling effect. This indicates the relevant role of the fine dust particles in DRE estimations, which is likely underestimated when total dust (no separation) is taken into account in relatively high-dust environments. In addition, the cooling effect is more evident at TOA than at BOA, probably due to the presence of dust at higher levels than those usual in the troposphere. This fact can introduce relevant implications for radiometric measurements from satellite instrumentation."
10.5194/acp-25-3109-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了黑碳折射率的不确定性对模拟光学厚度和辐射强迫的影响。研究发现，黑碳折射率的变化会显著影响吸收性气溶胶光学厚度和黑碳辐射强迫，其影响程度与气溶胶排放清单的更新以及不同卫星观测结果的差异相当。论文强调了在模型对比项目中考虑折射率多样性的重要性。由于黑碳是大气中的重要成分，且该研究使用了MISR和POLDER-GRASP等卫星数据，因此与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['black carbon', 'refractive index', 'absorbing aerosol optical depth', 'radiative forcing', 'MISR', 'POLDER-GRASP', 'satellite observations', 'aerosol emission', 'air quality']",Ruth A. R. Digby;Knut von Salzen;Adam H. Monahan;Nathan P. Gillett;Jiangnan Li,The impact of uncertainty in black carbon's refractive index on simulated optical depth and radiative forcing,"The refractive index of black carbon (BCRI), which determines how much energy black carbon absorbs and scatters, is difficult to measure, and different climate models use different values. We show that varying the BCRI across commonly used values can increase absorbing aerosol optical depth by 42 % and the warming effect from interactions between black carbon and radiation by 47 %, an appreciable fraction of the overall spread between models reported in recent literature assessments. 
 The radiative forcing of black carbon (BC) is subject to many complex, interconnected sources of uncertainty. Here we isolate the role of the refractive index, which determines the extent to which BC absorbs and scatters radiation. We compare four refractive index schemes: three that are commonly used in Earth system models and a fourth more recent estimate with higher absorption. With other parameterizations held constant, changing BC's spectrally varying refractive index from the least- to  most-absorbing estimate commonly used in Earth system models (m550 nm=1.75–0.44i to m550 nm=1.95–0.79i) increases simulated absorbing aerosol optical depth (AAOD) by 42 % and the effective radiative forcing from BC–radiation interactions (BC ERFari) by 47 %. The more recent estimate, m532 nm=1.48–0.84i, increases AAOD and BC ERFari by 59 % and 100 % respectively relative to the low-absorption case. The AAOD increases are comparable to those from recent updates to aerosol emission inventories and, in BC source regions, up to two-thirds as large as the difference in AAOD retrieved from MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) and POLDER-GRASP (Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances instrument with the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties algorithm) satellites. The BC ERFari increases are comparable to previous assessments of overall uncertainties in BC ERFari, even though this source of uncertainty is typically overlooked. Although model sensitivity to the choice of BC refractive index is known to be modulated by other parameterization choices, our results highlight the importance of considering refractive index diversity in model intercomparison projects."
10.5194/acp-25-3131-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了风速对海洋气溶胶（SSA）和冰核粒子（INP）排放的影响，这些粒子对大气辐射强迫和云的形成至关重要。研究发现，大气中的INP浓度与风速有关，但离线测量结果并非如此，这可能与采样方式有关。研究表明，风速和海浪破碎力学是影响大气INP变化的主要因素，而不是海水的化学或生物因素。虽然具体的排放机制尚不明确，但这些发现有助于解释环境测量中INP浓度和成分的一些变化。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及气溶胶的组成、来源和对气候的影响，这些都是大气成分分析和空气质量监测的重要方面。,"['Sea spray aerosol (SSA)', 'Ice-nucleating particles (INPs)', 'Aerosol radiative forcing', 'Cloud formation', 'Wind speed', 'Wave-breaking mechanics', 'Atmospheric composition']",Kathryn A.

Prather;Paul J. DeMott,Wind-driven emission of marine ice-nucleating particles in the Scripps Ocean-Atmosphere Research Simulator (SOARS),"This article presents results from the first study in a new wind–wave channel at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The experiment tested how wind over the ocean surface influences production of sea spray particles, which are important for radiative forcing and cloud formation in the atmosphere. We found that particle concentration and chemical composition varied with wind speed and that variations were driven by changes in wind and wave breaking rather than seawater biology or chemistry. 
 Sea spray aerosol (SSA) represents one of the most abundant natural aerosol types, contributing significantly to global aerosol mass and aerosol optical depth, as well as to both the magnitude of and the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing. In addition to its direct effects, SSA can also serve as ice-nucleating particles (INPs), which are required for the initiation of cloud glaciation at temperatures warmer than ca. −36 °C. This study presents initial results from the CHaracterizing Atmosphere-Ocean parameters in SOARS (CHAOS) mesocosm campaign, which was conducted in the new Scripps Ocean-Atmosphere Research Simulator (SOARS) wind–wave channel. SOARS allows for isolation of individual factors, such as wave height, wind speed, water temperature, or biological state, and can carefully vary them in a controlled manner. Here, we focus on the influence of wind speed on the emission of SSA and INPs. In agreement with recent Southern Ocean measurements, online INP concentrations during CHAOS showed an increasing relationship with wind speed, whereas offline CHAOS INP concentrations did not, which may be related to sampling inlet differences. Changes in the INP activated fraction, dominant INP particle morphology, and INP composition were seen to vary with wind. Seawater ice-nucleating entity concentrations during CHAOS were stable over time, indicating that changes in atmospheric INPs were driven by wind speed and wave-breaking mechanics rather than variations in seawater chemistry or biology. While specific emission mechanisms remain elusive, these observations may help explain some of the variability in INP concentration and composition that has been seen in ambient measurements."

Sokhi;Stefano Galmarini,Critical load exceedances for North America and Europe using an ensemble of models and an investigation of causes of environmental impact estimate variability: an AQMEII4 study,"The large range of sulfur and nitrogen deposition estimates from air quality models results in a large range of predicted impacts. We used models and deposition diagnostics to identify the processes controlling atmospheric sulfur and nitrogen deposition variability. Controlling factors included the uptake of gases and aerosols by hydrometeors, aerosol inorganic chemistry, particle dry deposition, ammonia bidirectional fluxes, gas deposition via plant cuticles and soil, and land use data. 
 Exceedances of critical loads for deposition of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) in different ecosystems were estimated using European and North American ensembles of air quality models, under the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative Phase 4 (AQMEII4), to identify where the risk of ecosystem harm is expected to occur based on model deposition estimates. The ensembles were driven by common emissions and lateral boundary condition inputs. Model output was regridded to common North American and European 0.125° resolution domains, which were then used to calculate critical load exceedances. Targeted deposition diagnostics implemented in AQMEII4 allowed for an unprecedented level of post-simulation analysis to be carried out and facilitated the identification of specific causes of model-to-model variability in critical load exceedance estimates.Datasets for North American critical loads for acidity for forest soil water and aquatic ecosystems were created for this analysis. These were combined with the ensemble deposition predictions to show a substantial decrease in the area and number of locations in exceedance between 2010 and 2016 (forest soils: 13.2 % to 6.1 %; aquatic ecosystems: 21.2 % to 11.4 %). All models agreed regarding the direction of the ensemble exceedance change between 2010 and 2016. The North American ensemble also predicted a decrease in both the severity and total area in exceedance between the years 2010 and 2016 for eutrophication-impacted ecosystems in the USA (sensitive epiphytic lichen: 81.5 % to 75.8 %). The exceedances for herbaceous-community richness also decreased between 2010 and 2016, from 13.9 % to 3.9 %. The uncertainty associated with the North American eutrophication results is high; there were sharp differences between the models in predictions of both total N deposition and the change in N deposition and hence in the predicted eutrophication exceedances between the 2 years. The European ensemble was used to predict relatively static exceedances of critical loads with respect to acidification (4.48 % to 4.32 % from 2009 to 2010), while eutrophication exceedance increased slightly (60.2 % to 62.2 %).While most models showed the same changes in critical load exceedances as the ensemble between the 2 years, the spatial extent and magnitude of exceedances varied significantly between the models. The reasons for this variation were examined in detail by first ranking the relative contribution of different sources of sulfur and nitrogen deposition in terms of deposited mass and model-to-model variability in that deposited mass, followed by their analysis using AQMEII4 diagnostics, along with evaluation of the most recent literature.All models in both the North American and European ensembles had net annual negative biases with respect to the observed wet deposition of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. Diagnostics and recent literature suggest that this bias may stem from insufficient cloud scavenging of aerosols and gases and may be improved through the incorporation of multiphase hydrometeor scavenging within the modelling frameworks. The inability of North American models to predict the timing of the seasonal peak in wet ammonium ion deposition (observed maximum was in April, while all models predicted a June maximum) may also relate to the need for multiphase hydrometeor scavenging (absence of snow scavenging in all models employed here). High variability in the relative importance of particulate sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium deposition fluxes between models was linked to the use of updated particle dry-deposition parameterizations in some models. However, recent literature and the further development of some of the models within the ensemble suggest these particulate biases may also be ameliorated via the incorporation of multiphase hydrometeor scavenging. Annual sulfur and nitrogen deposition prediction variability was linked to SO2 and HNO3 dry-deposition parameterizations, and diagnostic analysis showed that the cuticle and soil deposition pathways dominate the deposition mass flux of these species. Further work improving parameterizations for these deposition pathways should reduce variability in model acidifying-gas deposition estimates. The absence of base cation chemistry in some models was shown to be a major factor in positive biases in fine-mode particulate ammonium and particle nitrate concentrations. Models employing ammonia bidirectional fluxes had both the largest- and the smallest-magnitude biases, depending on the model and bidirectional flux algorithm employed. A careful analysis of bidirectional flux models suggests that those with poor NH3 performance may underestimate the extent of NH3 emission fluxes from forested areas.Model–measurement fusion in the form of a simple bias correction was applied to the 2016 critical loads. This generally reduced variability between models. However, the bias correction exercise illustrated the need for observations which close the sulfur and nitrogen budgets in carrying out model–measurement fusion. Chemical transformations between different forms of sulfur and nitrogen in the atmosphere sometimes result in compensating biases in the resulting total sulfur and nitrogen deposition flux fields. If model–measurement fusion is only applied to some but not all of the fields contributing to the total deposition of sulfur or nitrogen, the corrections may result in greater variability between models or less accurate results for an ensemble of models, for those cases where an unobserved or unused observed component contributes significantly to predicted total deposition.Based on these results, an increased process-research focus is therefore recommended for the following model processes and for observations which may assist in model evaluation and improvement: multiphase hydrometeor scavenging combined with updated particle dry-deposition, cuticle, and soil deposition pathway algorithms for acidifying gases, base cation chemistry and emissions, and NH3 bidirectional fluxes. Comparisons with satellite observations suggest that oceanic NH3 emission sources should be included in regional chemical transport models. The choice of a land use database employed within any given model was shown to significantly influence deposition totals in several instances, and employing a common land use database across chemical transport models and critical load calculations is recommended for future work."

Measurements revealed urban emission impact on surrounding areas. CRI full period averages at 520 nm were 1.41 – 0.037i (urban), 1.52 – 0.038i (peri-urban), and 1.50 – 0.025i (rural). Organic aerosols dominated the aerosol mass and contributed up to 22 % of absorption at 370 nm. 
 The complex refractive index (CRI; n−ik) and the single scattering albedo (SSA) are key parameters driving the aerosol direct radiative effect. Their spatial, temporal, and spectral variabilities in anthropogenic–biogenic mixed environments are poorly understood. In this study, we retrieve the spectral CRI and SSA (370–950 nm wavelength range) from in situ surface optical measurements and the number size distribution of submicron aerosols at three sites in the greater Paris area, representative of the urban city, as well as its peri-urban and forested rural environments. Measurements were taken as part of the ACROSS (Atmospheric Chemistry of the Suburban Forest) campaign in June–July 2022 under diversified conditions: (1) two heatwaves leading to high aerosol levels, (2) an intermediate period with low aerosol concentrations, and (3) an episode of long-range-transported fire emissions. The retrieved CRI and SSA exhibit an urban-to-rural gradient, whose intensity is modulated by the weather conditions. A full campaign average CRI of 1.41−0.037i (urban), 1.52−0.038i (peri-urban), and 1.50−0.025i (rural) is retrieved. The imaginary part of the CRI (k) increases and the SSA decreases at the peri-urban and forest sites when exposed to the influence of the Paris urban plume. Values of k > 0.1 and SSA < 0.6 at 520 nm are related to a black carbon mass fraction larger than 10 %.

Besides local heat waves, we quantify the impact of atmospheric blocking on downstream ozone concentrations, which is closely associated with the blocking position. We identify three major pathways of Rossby wave propagation, stressing the critical role of large-scale circulation in regional air quality. 
 High surface ozone concentrations pose substantial health risks, yet understanding the factors influencing ozone levels, especially the role of large-scale circulations, remains incomplete. A key challenge is accurately modeling both large-scale circulations and ozone concentrations. Using a high-resolution Earth system model (25 km atmospheric resolution), we explore how local meteorology and large-scale circulations affect ozone levels. Our results show that heat waves can trigger substantial increases in ozone concentrations by stimulating biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions during the summers of 2015–2019. For example, maximum daily 8 h (MDA8) ozone concentrations during heat waves increase by 12.0 ppbv in the southeastern US, 9.7 ppbv in Europe, 17.6 ppbv in North China, and 9.0 ppbv in central eastern China compared to non-heat-wave periods. In addition to local effects, atmospheric blocking strongly influences downstream meteorological conditions and ozone formation. Focusing on ozone pollution in eastern China, we identify three major pathways of Rossby wave propagation based on blocking locations: the Euro-Atlantic sector, northern Russia, and the North Pacific. These pathways lead to increased air temperature and intensify downward surface solar radiation downstream. The impact of blocking is most pronounced in central eastern China, where MDA8 ozone concentrations increase by 5.9 to 10.7 ppbv during blocking compared to non-blocking periods, followed by North China (2.1 to 4.9 ppbv). Blocking also stimulates BVOC emissions, enhancing MDA8 ozone concentrations by 10.6 to 15.9 ppbv in these regions. These findings highlight the critical role of large-scale atmospheric circulation in shaping regional air quality, especially under a warming climate."

Mohammadloo;Matthew Jones;Bas van de Kerkhof;Kyle Dawson;Brendan J. Smith;Stephen Conley;Abigail Corbett;Rutger IJzermans,Quantitative estimate of several sources of uncertainty in drone-based methane emission measurements,"Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Trustable detection and quantification of methane emissions at facility level are critical for identifying the largest sources and prioritizing them for repair. We provide a systematic analysis of several sources of uncertainty in drone-based methane emission surveys based on theoretical considerations and historical data sets. We provide guidelines for industry on how to avoid or minimize errors in drone-based methane emission quantification surveys. 
 Site-level measurements of methane emissions are used by operators for reconciliation with bottom-up emission inventories with the aim to improve accuracy, thoroughness,  and confidence in reported emissions. In that context it is of critical importance to avoid measurement errors and to understand the measurement uncertainty. Remotely piloted aircraft systems (commonly referred to as “drones”) can play a pivotal role in the quantification of site-level methane emissions. Typical implementations use the “mass balance method” to quantify emissions, with a high-precision methane sensor mounted on a quadcopter drone flying in a vertical curtain pattern; the total mass emission rate can then be computed post hoc from the measured methane concentration data and simultaneous wind data. Controlled-release tests have shown that errors with the mass balance method can be considerable. For example, Liu et al. (2024) report absolute errors for more than 100 % for the two drone solutions tested; on the other hand, errors can be much smaller, of the order of 16 % root-mean-square errors in Corbett and Smith (2022), if additional constraints are placed on the data, restricting the analysis to cases where the wind field was steady. In this paper we present a systematic error analysis of physical phenomena affecting the error in the mass balance method for parameters related to the acquisition of methane concentration data and to postprocessing. The sources of error are analyzed individually, and it must be realized that individual errors can accumulate in practice, and they can also be augmented by other sources that are not included in the present work. Examples of these sources include the uncertainty in methane concentration measurements by a sensor with finite precision or the method used to measure the unperturbed wind velocity at the position of the drone. We find that the most important source of error considered is the horizontal and vertical spacings in the data acquisition,  as a coarse spacing can result in missing a methane plume. The potential error  can be as high as 100 % in situations where the wind speed is steady and the methane plume has a coherent shape, contradicting the intuition of some operators in the industry. The likelihood of the extent of this error can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless number defined by the spatial resolution of the methane concentration measurements and the downwind distance from the main emission sources. What is learned from our theoretical error analysis is then applied to a number of historical measurements in a controlled-release setting. We show how what is learned  about the main sources of error can be used to eliminate potential errors during the postprocessing of flight data. Second, we evaluate an aggregated data set of 1001 historical drone flights; our analysis shows that the potential errors in the mass balance method can be of the order of 100 % on occasion, even though the individual errors can be much smaller in the vast majority of the flights. The Discussion section provides some guidelines for industry on how to avoid or minimize potential errors in drone measurements for methane emission quantification."

We describe the data assemblage and associated quality control and discuss some potential uses of this dataset. The dataset is provided in a single format and includes the quality flag for each sample. 
 Total alkalinity (AT) and dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) in the oceans are important properties to understand the ocean carbon cycle and its link with global change (ocean carbon sinks and sources, ocean acidification) and ultimately to find carbon-based solutions or mitigation procedures (marine carbon removal). We present an extended database (SNAPO-CO2; Metzl et al., 2024c) with 24 700 new additional data for the period 2002 to 2023. The full database now includes more than 67 000 AT and CT observations along with basic ancillary data (time and space location, depth, temperature, and salinity) in various oceanic regions obtained since 1993 mainly in the framework of French research projects. This includes both surface and water columns data acquired in open oceans, coastal zones, rivers, the Mediterranean Sea, and either from time series stations or punctual cruises. Most AT and CT data in this synthesis were measured from discrete samples using the same closed-cell potentiometric titration calibrated with certified reference material, with an overall accuracy of ±4 µmol kg−1 for both AT and CT. The same technique was used on board for underway measurements during cruises conducted in the southern Indian and Southern oceans. The AT and CT data from these cruises are also added to this synthesis. The data are provided in one dataset for the global ocean (https://doi.org/10.17882/102337, Metzl et al., 2024c) that offers a direct use for regional or global purposes, e.g., AT–salinity relationships, long-term CT estimates, constraint and validation of diagnostics CT and AT reconstructed fields, ocean carbon and coupled climate–carbon models simulations, and data derived from Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) floats. These data can also be used to calculate pH, fugacity of CO2 (fCO2), and other carbon system properties to derive ocean acidification rates or air–sea CO2 fluxes."

These living datasets are updated every year to provide the highest transparency and traceability in the reporting of CO2, the key driver of climate change. 
 Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize datasets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC) are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The global net uptake of CO2 by the ocean (SOCEAN, called the ocean sink) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based fCO2 products (fCO2 is the fugacity of CO2). The global net uptake of CO2 by the land (SLAND, called the land sink) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements, and Earth system models. The sum of all sources and sinks results in the carbon budget imbalance (BIM), a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ.For the year 2023, EFOS increased by 1.3 % relative to 2022, with fossil emissions at 10.1 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (10.3 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is not included), and ELUC was 1.0 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 11.1 ± 0.9 GtC yr−1 (40.6 ± 3.2 GtCO2 yr−1). Also, for 2023, GATM was 5.9 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.79 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1; ppm denotes parts per million), SOCEAN was 2.9 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 2.3 ± 1.0 GtC yr−1, with a near-zero BIM (−0.02 GtC yr−1). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2023 reached 419.31 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2024 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2023 of +0.8 % (−0.2 % to 1.7 %) globally and an atmospheric CO2 concentration increase by 2.87 ppm, reaching 422.45 ppm, 52 % above the pre-industrial level (around 278 ppm in 1750). Overall, the mean of and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2023, with a near-zero overall budget imbalance, although discrepancies of up to around 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows the following: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use change emissions, (2) low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the mean ocean sink.This living-data update documents changes in methods and datasets applied to this most recent global carbon budget as well as evolving community understanding of the global carbon cycle.

PRIME allows large ensembles to be run on multi-centennial timescales, including the analysis of many important variables for impact assessments. Our evaluation shows that PRIME reproduces the climate response for known scenarios, providing confidence in using PRIME for novel scenarios. 
 Climate policies evolve quickly, and new scenarios designed around these policies are used to illustrate how they impact global mean temperatures using simple climate models (or climate emulators). Simple climate models are extremely efficient, although some can only provide global estimates of climate metrics such as mean surface temperature, CO2 concentration and effective radiative forcing. Within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework, understanding of the regional impacts of scenarios that include the most recent science is needed to allow targeted policy decisions to be made quickly. To address this, we present PRIME (Probabilistic Regional Impacts from Model patterns and Emissions), a new flexible probabilistic framework which aims to provide an efficient mechanism to run new scenarios without the significant overheads of larger, more complex Earth system models (ESMs). PRIME provides the capability to include features of the most recent ESM projections, science and scenarios to run ensemble simulations on multi-centennial timescales and include analyses of many key variables that are relevant and important for impact assessments. We use a simple climate model to provide the global temperature response to emissions scenarios. These estimated temperatures are used to scale monthly mean patterns from a large number of CMIP6 ESMs. These patterns provide the inputs to a “weather generator” algorithm and a land surface model. The PRIME system thus generates an end-to-end estimate of the land surface impacts from the emissions scenarios. We test PRIME using known scenarios in the form of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), to demonstrate that our model reproduces the ESM climate responses to these scenarios. We show results for a range of scenarios: the SSP5–8.5 high-emissions scenario was used to define the patterns, and SSP1–2.6, a mitigation scenario with low emissions, and SSP5–3.4-OS, an overshoot scenario, were used as verification data. PRIME correctly represents the climate response (and spread) for these known scenarios, which gives us confidence our simulation framework will be useful for rapidly providing probabilistic spatially resolved information for novel climate scenarios, thereby substantially reducing the time between new scenarios being released and the availability of regional impact information."

Benning,Immobilization of Chromium by Iron Oxides in Nickel–Cobalt Laterite Mine Tailings,"Mine tailings generated from hydrometallurgical processing of nickel–cobalt laterite deposits contain high levels of chromium (Cr), with the hexavalent species being a toxic pollutant and carcinogen. However, the partitioning, speciation, and local bonding environment of Cr in the mine tailings remain largely unknown, hindering our ability to predict its toxicity and long-term behavior. Coupling detailed mineralogical, spectroscopic, and geochemical characterization with sequential extraction of tailings from active and rehabilitated dams, we show that Cr is present in its least toxic form, Cr(III), and largely immobilized by recalcitrant minerals. This immobilization also regulates dissolved Cr concentrations in the interacting waters to levels up to five times lower than the global regulatory limit (50 μg L–1). Solid-phase Cr concentrations were ≤1.5 wt % with 39–61% of Cr incorporated into hematite, and to a lesser extent, alunite, both of which formed early in the hydrometallurgical extraction process of mined laterite ores. The remaining Cr was present as recalcitrant chromite residues from the primary source laterites. We highlight that, although hydrometallurgical extractions liberate Cr from laterite ores during processing, they also provide ideal chemical pathways for the formation of highly stable, crystalline hematite that successfully sequesters Cr, while restricting its environmental mobility."

Recently, various hydrated electron-based techniques have been developed to destroy these compounds. However, the molecular mechanisms controlled by different hydrated electron photosensitizers are still unclear. Herein, we investigated the PFAS transformation processes in different hydrated electron-based systems, i.e., UV/Na2SO3, UV/indole, and UV/3-indoleacetic acid (IAA), using different perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCA) as model compounds. By monitoring the production and decay of hydrated electrons, molecular interactions, and the generated intermediates, we systematically revealed the structure-property-performance mechanism of different systems. In the UV/Na2SO3 system, the disordered attack of hydrated electrons induced rapid destruction for either long or short-chain PFCA. However, the lower hydrated electron efficiency limited the final defluorination ratio. In the UV/indole system, the interaction between indole and PFCA promoted the directed transfer of hydrated electrons, resulting in a significantly higher destruction efficiency for long-chain PFCA than for short-chain PFCA. However, the self-quenching of hydrated electrons in the UV/IAA system led to the ineffective decomposition for all PFCA. This study provides mechanistic insights into the hydrated electron-induced PFAS decomposition processes, which would expand the designing strategies for improving PFAS destruction efficiency."

CWD is caused by infectious prions, which can enter the environment through bodily fluids or the carcasses of infected animals. Prions can be stored, remain infectious in both soil and water for many years, and transported hydrologically, possibly expanding the geographic range of CWD transmission. In order to better predict hydrological prion transport, we investigated how CWD prion protein (PrPCWD) partitions and persists in environmental waters. We performed PrPCWD spike experiments with water samples containing fine sediments from two locations within a CWD-contaminated site, at which contamination sources were removed one year prior. Samples were filtered after spiking, and filtrates and sediments were tested separately for PrPCWD using real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). Unspiked filtrates tested negative for PrPCWD, while unspiked sediments were positive, indicating PrPCWD persistence in environmental sediments for at least one year. Spiked sediments were positive immediately after spiking and throughout 28 days of incubation. Spiked filtrates were largely negative immediately after spiking and remained negative for 28 days, with some inconsistent positives from one sampling location. Our results indicate that PrPCWD readily partitions to the sediment fraction of environmental waters, suggesting that hydrological prion transport is sediment-facilitated."

As an emerging persistent organic pollutant, their toxicity mechanisms, particularly concerning the female reproductive system, remain poorly understood. In this study, we present both in vivo and in vitro evidence of ovarian toxicity induced by MCCPs and insights into their underlying molecular mechanisms. MCCP exposure induced chromatin condensation in the nucleus and mitochondria vacuolization of ovarian granulosa cells in rats and significantly increased the levels of serum gonadotropins and sex hormones, while reducing gonadotropin-releasing hormone levels. Transcriptomics analysis of ovaries revealed a predominant effect of MCCPs on the cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, and DNA damage repair pathways. Moreover, dual-omics integrative analysis indicated significant disturbance of steroid hormone biosynthesis caused by MCCPs, as well as amino acid metabolism related to TCA cycle. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that MCCP exposure disrupts intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and generates reactive oxygen species, ultimately leading to DNA damage.

Pregnant mice received PFOS (0.3 and 3 μg/g bw) and were sacrificed on gestation day 14.5. Metabolomic analysis of maternal plasma revealed disruptions in steroid hormone, purine, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism, which aligned with the enriched pathways in amniotic fluid (AF). FL analysis indicated increased purine metabolism and disrupted glucose and amino acid metabolism. FL exhibited higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, glycolytic and TCA metabolites, and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-23, crucial for hematopoiesis regulation. Transcriptomic analysis of FL-HSCs revealed disturbances in the PPAR signaling pathway, pyruvate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and amino acid metabolism, correlating with FL metabolic changes. Metabolomic analysis indicated significant rises in glycerophospholipid and vitamin B6 metabolism related to HSC expansion and differentiation. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed increased HSC populations and progenitor activation for megakaryocyte, erythrocyte, and lymphocyte lineages. The CFU assay showed a significant increase in BFU-E and CFU-G, but a decrease in CFU-GM in FL-HSCs from the H-PFOS group, indicating altered differentiation potential. These findings provide for the first time insights into the effects of PFOS on maternal-fetal metabolism and fetal hematopoiesis, highlighting implications for pollution-affected immune functions."

Using particle‐in‐cell simulations, we investigate their physical mechanisms. The reconnection rate, when normalized by ion parameters (Ri ${R}_{i}$), may appear anomalously high, whereas that normalized by electron parameters (Re ${R}_{e}$) remains ∼0.1. We propose that the essence of high Ri ${R}_{i}$ is insufficient field line bending outside the electron diffusion region, indicating an incomplete development of the ion diffusion region. It may result from bursty reconnection in thin current sheets, or small system sizes. The ion outflow diminishes at high βi ${\beta }_{i}$ when the gyroradius (ρi ${\rho }_{i}$) exceeds the system size. Low‐velocity ions still experience notable acceleration from Hall fields. However, a local distribution includes many high‐velocity ions that experience random accelerations from different electric fields across ρi ${\rho }_{i}$, resulting in near‐zero bulk velocities.

Notably, the temperature changes in both the Antarctic and the Arctic show significant seasonal differences, with the largest polar response during the cold seasons. Around the Antarctic, both the ACC and overturning circulation exhibit stronger acceleration in winter than in summer, causing more pronounced cooling in winter.

We studied the seismic signals emitted near rivers in two tributaries characterized by large boulders. Data show an unusually high dominant seismic frequency, reaching >2 times the frequency observed in nearby smoother channels. Consistent high‐frequency content during periods without bedload transport prompts the hypothesis that turbulence is a key contributor to generating higher frequencies. Assuming that dominant turbulent eddies decrease in size due to boulder‐constrained flow, we formulate a frequency scaling relationship that aligns well with field data. A positive relationship of the frequency with water depth breaks at bedload onset, indicating that dissipation of flow energy partitions between turbulence and bedload transport. Our study shows that seismic frequency captures contrasting bed morphologies in mountain streams, offering insights into flow‐roughness interactions."

Both case studies, and a statistical analysis, reveal a direct correspondence between the magnitude of density gradients and wave obliquity, with θk ${\theta }_{k}$ increasing near stronger density gradients. Wave propagation is also investigated as a function of local plasma density, revealing that chorus is more often oblique when observed in lower density mediums, and more field‐aligned in higher density regions. This result highlights the importance of retaining the intrinsic physical coupling between wave propagation properties and the cold plasma density, since both parameters strongly influence the calculation of the diffusion coefficients used to quantify wave‐particle interactions in the inner‐magnetosphere."

We investigated the changes in atmospheric actual water vapor (AVP) at seasonal and spatial scales from 1979 to 2018 and their sensitivity to air temperature (Savp). Comparing two different periods, 1979–1998 and 1999–2018, large differences in Savp were found over land during summer. The west coasts of low‐latitude regions gained enhanced water vapor for each 1°C increase in temperature, while the east coasts showed a deceleration in additional water vapor for each 1°C increase in temperature in the latter period compared to the former one. Although there is spatial heterogeneity in changes in Savp after the 1990s compared to before the 1990s, overall summer Savp has decreased by 33% over land and 27% in the monsoon region. These shifts were well reproduced by the Community Earth System Model and are closely related to a shift in low‐latitude ocean evaporation (Eocean) from an upward trend before the late 1990s to a downward trend after the late 1990s (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we found that the significant decrease (p < 0.05) in Savp over land in summer was due to (a) weaker increase in actual atmospheric water vapor and (b) reduced zonal winds from oceans to the land, rather than through the direct effects of global warming on the atmospheric water demand. These results highlight the urgent need for Eocean monitoring and forecasting to accurately assess land Savp. Significance statements understanding how water vapor responds to changes in temperature is crucial for understanding global climate dynamics and the movement of water, energy, and carbon throughout the Earth system. We investigated the variations in water vapor temperature sensitivity across different seasons and regions from 1979 to 2018. By comparing two time periods, we found great differences in water vapor temperature sensitivity over land during summer. Overall, there was a weakening of water vapor temperature sensitivity over land and in monsoon regions. These changes were predicted by a climate model and correlated closely with changes in ocean evaporation patterns. This highlights the importance of closely monitoring ocean evaporation to predict the response of water vapor to warming over land."

 In photosynthetic organisms, light acts as an environmental signal to control their development and physiology, as well as energy source to drive the conversion of CO2 into carbohydrates used for growth or storage. The main storage carbohydrate in green algae is starch, which accumulates during the day and is broken down at night to meet cellular energy demands. The signaling role of light quality in the regulation of starch accumulation remains unexplored. Here, we identify PHOTOTROPIN-MEDIATED SIGNALING KINASE 1 (PMSK1) as a key regulator of starch metabolism in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In its phosphorylated form (PMSK1-P), it activates GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE (GAP1), promoting starch biosynthesis. We show that blue light, perceived by PHOTOTROPIN, induces PMSK1 dephosphorylation that in turn represses GAP1 mRNA levels and reduces starch accumulation. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized blue light-mediated signaling pathway that advances our understanding of photoreceptor-controlled carbon metabolism in microalgae.

 Recurrent gain-of-function mutations in the histone reader protein ENL have been identified in Wilms tumor, the most prevalent pediatric kidney cancer. However, their pathological significance in kidney development and tumorigenesis in vivo remains elusive. Here, we generate mouse models mimicking ENL tumor (ENLT) mutations and show that heterozygous mutant expression in Six2+ nephrogenic or Foxd1+ stromal lineages leads to severe, lineage-specific kidney defects, both resulting in neonatal lethality. Six2-ENLT mutant kidneys display compromised cap mesenchyme, scant nephron tubules, and cystic glomeruli, indicative of premature progenitor commitment and blocked differentiation. Bulk and spatial transcriptomic analyses reveal aberrant activation of Hox and Wnt signaling genes in mutant nephrogenic cells. In contrast, Foxd1-ENLT mutant kidneys exhibit expansion in renal capsule and cap mesenchyme, with dysregulated stromal gene expression affecting stroma-epithelium crosstalk.

 The initial setting of telomere length during early life in each individual has a major influence on lifetime risk of aging-associated diseases; however there is limited knowledge of biological signals that regulate inheritance of telomere length, and whether it is modifiable is not known. We now show that when mitochondrial activity is disrupted in mouse zygotes, via exposure to 20% O2 or rotenone, telomere elongation between the 8-cell and blastocyst stage is impaired, with shorter telomeres apparent in the pluripotent Inner Cell Mass (ICM) and persisting after organogenesis. Identical defects of elevated mtROS in zygotes followed by impaired telomere elongation, occurred with maternal obesity or advanced age. We further demonstrate that telomere elongation during ICM formation is controlled by mitochondrial-nuclear communication at fertilization. Using mitochondrially-targeted therapeutics (BGP-15, MitoQ, SS-31, metformin) we demonstrate that it is possible to modulate the preimplantation telomere resetting process and restore deficiencies in neonatal telomere length.

 With ongoing improvements in the detection of complex genomic and epigenomic variations, long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies could serve as a unified platform for clinical genetic testing, particularly in rare disease settings, where nearly half of patients remain undiagnosed using existing technologies. Here, we report a simplified funnel-down filtration strategy aimed at enhancing the identification of small and large deleterious variants as well as abnormal episignature disease profiles from whole-genome LRS data. This approach detected all pathogenic single nucleotide, structural, and methylation variants in a positive control set (N = 76) including an independent sample set with known methylation profiles (N = 57). When applied to patients who previously had negative short-read testing (N = 51), additional diagnoses were uncovered in 10% of cases, including a methylation profile at the spinal muscular atrophy locus utilized for diagnosing this life-threatening, yet treatable, condition.

Here, the authors show that reduction of astrocytic pleiotrophin in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex contributes to depression-like phenotype in male mice. 
 Astrocytes are closely linked to depression, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an important brain region involved in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the underlying mechanism by which astrocytes within PFC contribute to MDD remains unclear. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses, we show a significant reduction in astrocytes and attenuated pleiotrophin-protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTN-PTPRZ1) signaling in astrocyte-to-excitatory neuron communication in the PFC of male MDD patients. We find reduced astrocytes and PTN in the dorsomedial PFC of male mice with depression induced by chronic restraint and social defeat stress. Knockdown of astrocytic PTN induces depression-related responses, which is reversed by exogenous PTN supplementation or overexpression of astrocytic PTN. The antidepressant effects exerted by astrocytic PTN require interaction with PTPRZ1 in excitatory neurons, and PTN-PTPRZ1 activates the AKT signaling pathway to regulate depression-related responses. Our findings indicate the PTN-PTPRZ1-AKT pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for MDD. Astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex are closely linked to depression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

 The latitudinal distribution of winter extratropical precipitation is often regarded as being determined by the location and intensity of the storm track. Here, we compare the precipitation variability associated with the meridional eddy momentum flux (EMF) with that associated with an Eulerian storm track measure. Observations show that when the midlatitude EMF is anomalously poleward, the occurrence of moderate-to-heavy precipitation (1–33 mm day-1) increases between 45°N and 70°N, while decreasing between 25°N and 45°N. This shift occurs mostly downstream of the climatological storm track maximum, with generally greater precipitation anomalies compared to those associated with storm track changes. The shift is tied to changes in horizontal moisture transport primarily by planetary scale waves. These results suggest that, in addition to the storm track intensity, dynamics of the horizontal wave tilts which affect the EMF intensity need to be considered when projecting future changes in precipitation variability."

 The Arctic is experiencing heightened precipitation, affected by aerosols impacting rainfall and snowfall. However, sparse aerosol observations in the central Arctic cryosphere contribute to uncertainties in simulating aerosol-precipitation two-way interaction. This study examines aerosol-precipitation co-variation in various climate models during the Arctic spring and summer seasons from 2003 to 2011, leveraging satellite-based aerosol data and various CMIP6 climate models. Findings reveal significant spatio-temporal biases between models and observations. Snowfall dominance occurs in models where total AOD surpasses the observation by 121% (57–186%, confidence interval), intensifying simulated snowfall by two times compared to rainfall during summer. Consequently, climate models tend to underestimate central Arctic rainfall to the total precipitation ratio, suggesting a positive bias towards snowfall dominance. This highlights the importance of constraining total AOD and associated aerosol schemes in climate models using satellite measurements, which potentially could lead to a substantial reduction in snowfall contribution to the total precipitation ratio in the central Arctic, contrary to current multi-model simulations across various spatiotemporal scales."

 This study explores how the mixing structures and coating compositions of black carbon (BC) particles influence their light absorption, focusing on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which separates organic and inorganic phases and redistributes BC from the inorganic core (Icore) to the organic coating (Ocoating). Using transmission electron microscopy and 3D-modeling, we found that the BC core’s position significantly impacts its light absorption. A BC core embedded within the Icore shows stronger light absorption at wavelengths below 600 nm compared to the same core in the Ocoating. When Ocoating is considered as brown carbon (BrC), it reduces BC core’s light absorption at 350 nm due to shielding effect, but its overall impact on the entire BC particle is minimal (–3.0% ± 1.6%). The result indicates that in LLPS particles, the BrC coating primarily enhances light absorption, emphasizing the need to consider both mixing structures and coating compositions of BC in atmospheric models."

 Soil salinization, a critical form of global soil degradation, threatens agricultural productivity and ecosystem functions. Accurate mapping of soil salinity is essential for sustainable land management and informed decision-making. However, conventional optical or radar satellite sensors are often limited in detecting key salinity spectral signatures due to their insufficient thermal infrared (TIR) coverage. TIR remote sensing offers unique advantages for soil salinity assessment, owing to its sensitivity to the emissivity of saline soils within the TIR spectrum, but its application remains underexplored. This study evaluated the suitability and robustness of SDGSAT-1 TIS data for large-scale soil salinity mapping in the Songnen Plain, China, one of the world's three largest soda saline-alkali soil regions. We compared the performance of soil salinity models integrating SDGSAT-1 TIS data with those using optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1 and GF-3) data across several machine learning techniques. Our results demonstrated that incorporating SDGSAT-1 TIS data significantly enhanced soil salinity modeling accuracy, consistently outperforming models based solely on Sentinel-2 optical or Sentinel-1/GF-3 radar data. The combination of SDGSAT-1 TIS and Sentinel-2 data, optimized using the Gaussian Process Regression model, achieved the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 0.65 dS/m). The resulting salinity maps revealed widespread soil salinization across the region, with the majority of the area exhibiting slight to moderate salinity levels, posing substantial challenges to plant growth and ecosystem resilience. This study offers a robust, data-driven validation of TIR's unique sensitivity to soil salinity, emphasizing its potential for integration into large-scale soil salinity mapping frameworks."

 Scientific workflow management systems (WfMS) provide a systematic way to streamline necessary processes in scientific research. The demand for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) workflows is increasing in the scientific community, particularly in GIScience, where data is not just an output but an integral part of iterative advanced processes. Traditional WfMS often lack the capability to ensure geospatial data and process transparency, leading to challenges in reproducibility and replicability of research findings. This paper proposes the conceptualization and development of FAIR-oriented GIScience WfMS, aiming to incorporate the FAIR principles into the entire lifecycle of geospatial data processing and analysis. To enhance the findability and accessibility of workflows, the WfMS utilizes Harvard Dataverse to share all workflow-related digital resources, organized into workflow datasets, nodes, and case studies. Each resource is assigned a unique DOI (Digital Object Identifier), ensuring easy access and discovery. More importantly, the WfMS complies with the Common Workflow Language (CWL) standard to guarantee interoperability and reproducibility of workflows. It also enables the integration of diverse tools and software, supporting complex analyses that require multiple processing steps. This paper demonstrates the prototype of the GIScience WfMS and illustrates two geospatial science case studies, reflecting its flexibility in selecting appropriate techniques for various datasets and research goals.

 Tidal flats and their associated sandbanks are dynamic environments crucial for ecological balance and biodiversity. Monitoring their evolutionary history and topographic changes is important to better understand their dynamic mechanisms and predict their future status. Accurately mapping their evolution, however, remains challenging due to highly dynamic currents, suspended sediment variability, and unclear boundaries between land, tidal flats, and water. Traditional waterline methods struggle under these conditions. In this study, we propose an Object-Based Image Segmentation (OBIS) method, specifically designed for SAR images, to extract waterlines and distinguish tidal flats and shorelines from water bodies. This method integrates SAR polarimetric feature analysis to select high-quality images and employs partition processing to preserve local feature statistics. Using 199 Sentinel-1 GRD, 132 Radarsat-2 SLC, and 157 Landsat images, we analyzed coastal dynamics in the Dutch Wadden Sea from 1986 to 2020. Our DEMs, validated against LiDAR data (2016–2019) and 58 ground anchor measuring stations (2011–2020), achieved an accuracy of 10–30 cm.

The generated DEMs provide valuable insights for sediment budget evaluation and hydrodynamic modeling, supporting scientific research and coastal management.

 Dicarboxylic acids are important constituents of organic aerosols, but the lack of their seasonal and vertical distribution hinders thorough knowledge of atmospheric physicochemical behavior. This study examines dicarboxylic acids at three heights (∼3, 118, and 488 m) on the 600 m high Canton Tower in urban Guangzhou, aiming to illustrate their primary sources and formation pathways across different seasons and heights. The concentration of dicarboxylic acids (678.7 ± 351.9 ng m−3) was lower or comparable to those in domestic cities but higher than in remote aeras. Oxalic acid had the highest concentration, with malonic, succinic, glyoxylic, and azelaic acids following. Most dicarboxylic acids peaked in autumn, following by winter, spring and summer. Higher dicarboxylic acids were observed at upper layers. The C3/C4 (1.5 ± 0.5) was relatively higher, and the proportion of C2 in dicarboxylic acids increased with height. Our results showed that combustion and secondary conversion were primary sources of dicarboxylic acids in dry season, while biomass combustion and secondary formation processes dominated during wet season. Significant gas-phase oxidations were prevalent during summer, while aqueous-phase formations were prominent in spring. Aerosol aging process played an important role at higher atmospheric levels throughout the year, suggesting an enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity in upper boundary layers. These vertical profiling measurements enable the identification of predominant origins and formation pathways of dicarboxylic acids across different seasons and boundary layer dynamics. The findings provide critical insights for understanding atmospheric chemical evolution processes, validating atmospheric models, and developing effective air pollution mitigation strategies."

Here, we show that the neuronal SNARE (solubleN-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) complex proteins syntaxin and SNAP25 (synaptosome-associated protein 25), which enable synaptic transmission in the nervous system, inhibit the activity of the NALCN channel complex in both heterologous systems and primary neurons. The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signaling directly and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction could offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein–containing complexes."

Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome analyses of human and mouse muscles, we investigated pathogenic features in patients with DMD and palliative effects of glucocorticoids. Our approach further illuminated the importance of proliferating satellite cells and revealed increased activity of a signal transduction pathway involving EZH2 in the patient cells. Subsequent administration of EZH2 inhibitors toDmdmutant mice resulted in improved muscle phenotype through maintaining the immune-suppressing effect but overriding the muscle weakness and fibrogenic effects exerted by glucocorticoids. Our analysis reveals pathogenic mechanisms that can be readily targeted by extant therapeutic options for DMD."

Zare,Spraying of water microdroplets forms luminescence and causes chemical reactions in surrounding gas,"When neutral water is sprayed, oppositely charged microdroplets are formed. The close approach of oppositely charged microdroplets causes an electrical discharge and leads to luminescent emission. The light emission happens without any external voltage applied, and the electrical discharge is sufficiently energetic to excite, dissociate, or ionize surrounding neutral gas molecules. Thus, sprayed water microdroplets cause chemical reactions to occur. Similar findings to the Urey-Miller experiment were observed by spraying room temperature water microdroplets into a gas mixture containing nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, which leads to the synthesis of organic molecules containing carbon-nitrogen (C─N) bonds. These observations provide another explanation for unique reactivity at the gas-water interface, as well as a possible mechanism for making the building blocks of life on early Earth."

Through benchmarking, we demonstrate the superior performance of PseudoSorter compared to other spike sorting algorithms before applying PseudoSorter on MEA recordings from hippocampal neurons exposed to subneuronal concentrations of monomeric Tau as a model for Alzheimer’s disease. Our results unveil that Tau diminishes the firing rate of a subset of neurons, which complement our findings observed using conventional electrophysiology analysis, and demonstrate that PseudoSorter’s high accuracy and throughput make it a valuable tool for studying neurodegenerative diseases, enhancing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms, as well as for therapeutic drug screening."

We address this lack of reliability with a probabilistic deep learning method that identifies all realistic structures in seconds, redefining standards in reflectometry. Our method, prior-amortized neural posterior estimation (PANPE), combines simulation-based inference with adaptive priors that inform the inference network about known structural properties and controllable experimental conditions. PANPE networks support key scenarios such as high-throughput sample characterization, real-time monitoring of evolving structures, or the corefinement of several experimental datasets and can be adapted to provide fast, reliable, and flexible inference across many other inverse problems."

Here, combining first-principles calculations and machine learning molecular dynamics, we unravel the interplay between perovskite octahedral lattice dynamics and energy barrier associated with ion migration. Our results show that B-site substitution, particularly with alkaline-earth and lanthanide elements, notably strengthens lattice interactions, restrains octahedral oscillation, and increases iodine-migration barriers, outperforming the commonly used A-site and X-site substitutions and interstitial doping. Moreover, the enhanced barrier aligns with the geometric factor of μτ (tolerance-octahedral product), underlining the superior effectiveness of co- and multiple-element B-site doping in lattice stabilization and ion migration suppression. Experimental validation with exemplary hysteresis-free Eu-Ca–doped perovskite single crystals demonstrates remarkable improvements in ambient stability and transport properties.

WUI fires have notable impacts on key air pollutants [e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and ozone (O3)]. The health impact of WUI fire emission is disproportionately large compared to wildland fires primarily because WUI fires are closer to human settlement. Globally, the fraction of WUI fire–caused annual premature deaths (APDs) to all fire–caused APDs is about three times of the fraction of WUI fire emissions to all fire emissions.

Simulations recapitulate its stretched-exponential folding kinetics and reveal that misfolded states involving changes of entanglement underlie this behavior: either formation of a nonnative, noncovalent lasso entanglement or failure to form a native entanglement. These misfolded states act as kinetic traps, requiring extensive unfolding to escape, which results in a distribution of free energy barriers and pathway partitioning. Using LiP-MS and XL-MS, we propose heterogeneous structural ensembles consistent with these data that represent the potential long-lived misfolded states PGK populates.

The electron-rich oxygen vacancies modulate the local electronic structure of an Fe site. It facilitates reactive oxygen species generation by piezoelectric electrons and accelerates valence state cycles of Fe(III)/Fe(II) to achieve the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals via H2O2/Fe(II)–catalyzed chemodynamic reactions, which lead to bacterial membrane damage. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that intracellular Fe overload induced by excessive Fe(II)-mediated dysregulation of the two-component system disrupts bacterial metabolism, triggering bacterial ferroptosis-like death.

We report cryo–electron microscopy structures of eight different S-proteins from SARSr-CoVs found across Asia, Europe, and Africa. These S-proteins all adopt tightly packed, locked, prefusion conformations. These structures enable the classification of SARSr-CoV S-proteins into three types, based on their receptor-binding motif (RBM) structures and ACE2 binding characteristics. Type-2 S-proteins often preferentially bind bat ACE2 (bACE2) over hACE2. We report a structure of a type-2 BtKY72-RBD in complex with bACE2 to understand ACE2 specificity. Structure-guided mutagenesis of BtKY72-RBD reveals that multiple synergistic mutations in four different regions of RBM are required to achieve high-affinity hACE2 binding. Similar RBM changes can also confer hACE2 binding to another type-2 BM48-31 S-protein, which is primarily non-ACE2 binding. These results provide an understanding of how high-affinity hACE2 binding may be acquired by SARSr-CoV S-proteins."

BRDT knockdown in lung cancer cells slowed tumor growth and prolonged survival in a xenograft model. Comparative characterization of PTEFb complex participation and chromatin binding indicates BRD4-redundant and BRD4-distinct BRDT functions. Unlike dual depletion, individual BRD4 or BRDT knockdown did not impair transcriptional responses to hypoxia in BRDT-expressing cells, consistent with redundant function. However, BRD4 depletion/BRDT complementation revealed that BRDT can also release paused RNA polymerase II independently of its bromodomains as we previously demonstrated not to be required for Pol II pause/release function of BRD4, underscoring the functional importance of the C-terminal domains in both BRD4 and BRDT and their potential as therapeutic targets in solid tumors. Based on this study, future investigations should explore BRD4-distinct BRDT functions and BRDT misexpression driving cancer pathogenesis."

Here, we introduce a synthetic nanosensor for early AS detection that leverages the fluorescence and renal clearance properties of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). This nanosensor, designed to respond to the proteolytic activity of AS-associated dysregulated enzymes, entails CQDs as signal reporters to convert AS-associated proteolytic activity to fluorometric readings enabling a sensitive and cost-effective urine-based assay for early AS detection. Our findings demonstrated that the nanosensor provided distinct signals in atherosclerotic versus healthy mice at early AS stages, indicating its diagnostic potential. Moreover, toxicity tests showed no notable adverse effects, supporting its safety for diagnostic applications. This minimally invasive diagnostic approach could facilitate personalized therapy design and continuous efficacy assessment. It is expected that such a modular nanosensor platform can be integrated with simple urine tests to offer cost-effective detection of various diseases."

This study focuses on the fundamental dynamics of vortex-pair fields, specifically known as vortex-pair beams (VPBs) in optics. VPBs have gained increasing attention due to their unique properties, including vortex attraction and repulsion. Here, we explore the dynamics of pure-phase VPBs (PPVPBs) and observe intriguing helical and intertwined behaviors of vortices, resembling a vortex-pair dance. We uncover the oscillation property of the intervortex distance for PPVPBs in free space. The observed dancing and oscillation phenomena are intricately tied to the initial intervortex distance and can be explained well in the hydrodynamic picture. Notably, the vortex dancing and oscillation alter the process of vortex-pair annihilation, extending the survival range for opposite vortices. This discovery enhances our understanding of vortex interactions and sheds light on the intricate dynamics of both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex interactions."
