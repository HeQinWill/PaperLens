While hazard and exposure are key factors, vulnerability drivers play a crucial role in shaping these outcomes. However, few studies have examined these drivers at a continental scale. This study presents the first dynamic heat vulnerability assessment for Europe, incorporating spatial and temporal dimensions through ordinary least squares regression. Subnational (NUTS2) heatwave mortality data is used as the dependent variable, while independent variables include high-resolution raster data on heat hazard parameters, estimated population exposure, and socio-economic, demographic, and environmental vulnerability factors at both raster and subnational (NUTS2) scales. Our results (adjusted R2 = 0.662) identify foreign citizenship and urbanization as the most influential drivers, with a 1% increase in the percentage of foreign citizens and the size of urban areas associated with a 12.1% and 7.3% rise in heatwave-related mortality, respectively. Based on these findings, we construct the European heat vulnerability index for 2000–2019 as a weighted sum of the identified drivers, using the regression coefficients as weights. The results suggest that foreign citizens may face increased heat vulnerability due to intersecting socioeconomic factors. Policy recommendations include promoting inclusive integration measures to address disparities among foreign populations, and prioritizing sustainable urban planning and nature-based solutions to enhance resilience in rapidly urbanizing areas, ensuring equitable access to green spaces."

Current methods of estimating and predicting residential cooling demand are primarily based on daily temperature, which neglects intraday temperature variations. To determine whether large-scale cooling demand is substantially affected by intraday temperature variations, we conduct a thorough comparison between variable degree days (VDDs) derived from daily temperature data with variable degree hours (VDHs) derived from hourly temperature data during the summer seasons in the United States. The results imply that incorporating intraday variations in temperature will have substantial impacts on cooling estimation and prediction. A comparison of the historical (1990–2014) VDD and VDH calculated from ERA5 temperature data reveals that US summer cooling demand estimated from hourly temperature is 29%–45% higher than those estimated from daily temperature, with differences exceeding 60% when hourly solar radiation is considered. This occurs because the hourly calculations captures the ‘hot hours’ of the mild days. Future scenario analysis, using the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections, indicates that under the medium greenhouse gas emissions pathway (SSP2-45), US summer VDH and VDD are expected to increase by approximately 45% and 100% by the late century (2081–2100). This suggests that, daily-based predictions generally project cooling demand growth at twice the rate of hourly-based predictions, as the daily method accounts for increases in both high and low temperatures regardless of whether they exceed the baseline, while the hourly method, with its finer temporal resolution, includes only temperatures that surpass the baseline. Such effects are seen across most areas of the US. Our analysis underscores the significance of incorporating temperature data at higher temporal resolution in estimating and predicting cooling demand, which is essential for effectively implementing various measures to achieve energy conservation and climate goals."

In Western Europe, weather patterns are strongly influenced by large scale climate systems such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAOi). Recently, however, a new climate index has been developed, called the West Europe Pressure Anomaly (WEPAi), which may be more relevant for weather in North Western Europe. Recent attempts have tried to link variability in weather patterns as described by hydro-climatic indices and amplifications in the degradation of water quality. However, to our knowledge, no previous work has been undertaken on investigating their effects on suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs). A study was conducted in southwest England using long-term meteorological, monthly NAOi and WEPAi, and 15 min discharge and turbidity datasets collected from an instrumented field and catchment scale monitoring platform. Monthly winter precipitation totals, and air temperature were both found to be significantly positively related to NAOi, but not in the summer. Both variables were significant and more strongly related with the WEPAi for both seasons. Flow weighted mean SSCs calculated for both seasons over a 4 year period were compared to monthly NAOi and WEPAi. In winter months, no significant relationships were found at any scale for NAOi. However, significant positive relationships with the WEPAi were present regardless of catchment size. In the summer months there were no significant relationships with either climate indices. Large-scale climate drivers are important in the sediment responses of agricultural landscapes. An ability to forecast monthly climate scale drivers could enable farmers to better plan for those periods when hydro-sedimentological responses are likely to be elevated. More work is needed across a range of landscape typologies to confirm that the relationships observed hold true more widely."

This motivated the rapid development of trait-based ecological approaches that quantify functional traits of individuals to make inferences about ecological function. Long-term monitoring programs often collect community abundance data annually; yet, to our knowledge, these very different types of datasets have rarely been combined to hindcast shifts in community structure and function. Here, we merge the Moorea Coral Reef Long-Term Ecological Research dataset on benthic communities with a contemporary tropical seaweed trait database to quantify shifts in community function over nearly 20 years and through three distinctly different environmental disturbances. This research was motivated by global shifts on reefs to seaweed domination with unknown shifts in ecosystem functions. Using ordination, we visualized dramatic shifts in community trait space occupancy over time. When comparing mean trait value over time for each trait in each reef type, we describe rapid transitions in the functional ecology of seaweed communities in response to well-documented biotic and abiotic disturbances. A biotic disturbance that killed coral created seaweed communities with traits maximized for resistance to herbivory, while a physical disturbance resulted in a replacement community maximizing resistance to physical disturbance traits. Overall, we document transient shifts in community functional traits in response to shifts in environmental drivers, but also evidence for a stable attractor characterized by tall, less herbivore-resistant communities. Uncovering these shifts in ecological strategies in response to major disturbances demonstrates that combining trait-based approaches with long-term data provides a powerful tool for furthering understanding of how functional changes in communities are driven by environmental change."

Furthermore, changes to the fire regime, including the frequency, severity or seasonality of fire, can reduce resilience and promote persistent changes in ecosystem state. Wet sclerophyll forests are found in potentially dynamic mosaics of rainforest and dry sclerophyll forests and contain species from both these contrasting community types. As such, they create an opportunity to study alternative state theory in which states are mediated by fire regimes. To assess the resilience of wet sclerophyll forests to extreme fire events we specifically asked; do mortality rates and recruitment after fire differ between sclerophyllous and non-sclerophyllous components of wet sclerophyll forests, how do these impacts differ along gradients of fire severity and frequency, and is there evidence of positive fire feedback loops, and if so what levels of fire severity and frequency thresholds influence state shifts towards dry sclerophyll forest? We surveyed all canopy (upper and mid canopy) and grass species, to represent three key plant groups; Eucalyptus trees, non-sclerophyllous trees and grasses. We found strong evidence that fire frequency and severity determined the initial trajectory of wet sclerophyll forest recovery. Key findings showed that extreme fire severity can have significant impacts on non-sclerophyllous tree mortality, with an average of 72% of trees killed, much greater than in Eucalyptus species (mean mortality = 9%). However, our findings also highlighted the importance of analysing past fire regime variables, with sites experiencing 4–5 fires in 60 years also experiencing mortality rates of above 75% for non-sclerophyllous trees. Our results support the conclusion that a long multi-decadal fire-free interval is essential for these recovering wet sclerophyll forests, both to rebuild the resilience of their non-sclerophyllous biota and to reduce the risk of recurrent high severity fires in future."

While the direct effects of biochar on soil properties have been studied to some extent, the overall impact on ecosystem carbon balance remains uncertain, as field and lab studies typically do not account for interactions with vegetation. The LiDELS (LiBry-DETECT Layer Scheme) model offers a process-based approach to assess these soil-vegetation interactions and the potential for carbon sequestration in response to biochar application under diverse environmental conditions. This study presents an overview of the LiDELS model and its application to a sandy soil profile under the climate conditions of northern Germany. LiDELS simulates the impacts of biochar on key soil functions, including water retention, thermal properties, evapotranspiration rates, and net primary production (NPP). Model validation shows strong agreement with observed data for soil moisture, temperature, and CO2 flux, confirming LiDELS’s applicability across varying soil textures, vegetation types, and biochar treatments. Results indicate that biochar application to sandy soil in Hamburg enhances soil water availability by 35%, increases NPP by 6%, raises soil CO2 by 21%, and has no significant impact on soil respiration or soil temperature. LiDELS thus represents a valuable predictive tool for evaluating environmental feedback of biochar in agriculture and carbon management, supporting sustainable land use practices."

Recent satellite observations show TZCF shifting notably northward at a rate of 1.40 degrees per decade from 1998 to 2022, accompanied by a reduction of the chlorophyll concentration in the TZ. Using CMIP6 models with longer data, we find that this northward shift of TZCF is robust and accelerates with increasing warming. The weakening of zonal wind stress under global warming leads to a shallower vertical mixed layer and reduces southward transport via horizontal Ekman. These changes result in decreased nutrients in the upper ocean, ultimately causing a reduction in phytoplankton biomass in the North Pacific TZ and a northward shift of the TZCF. Our findings reveal a significant intervention of anthropogenic warming on marine ecosystems and provides a framework for understanding the linkage between anthropogenic warming and phytoplankton dynamics in the open ocean."

The Third Pole (TP) of the Earth, which serves as a critical water source for two billion people, is also experiencing this decline. However, the interplay between rising temperatures and increasing precipitation in the TP results in complex cryospheric responses, introducing uncertainties in the future budget of TP cryospheric water (including glacier and snow water equivalents and frozen soil moisture). Using a calibrated model that integrated multiple cryospheric-hydrological components and processes, we projected the TP cryospheric water budgets under both low and high climatic forcing scenarios for the period 2021–2100 and assessed the relative impact of temperature and precipitation. Results showed (1) that despite both scenarios involving simultaneous warming and wetting, under low climatic forcing, the total cryospheric budget exhibited positive dynamics (0.017 mm yr−1 with an average of 1.77 mm), primarily driven by increased precipitation. Glacier mass loss gradually declined with the rate of retreat slowing, accompanied by negligible declines in the budget of snow water equivalent and frozen soil moisture. (2) By contrast, high climatic forcing led to negative dynamics in the total cryospheric budget (−0.056 mm yr−1 with an average of −1.08 mm) dominated by warming, with accelerated decreases in the budget of all cryospheric components. These variations were most pronounced in higher-altitude regions, indicating elevation-dependent cryospheric budget dynamics. Overall, our findings present alternative futures for the TP cryosphere, and highlight novel evidence that optimistic cryospheric outcomes may be possible under specific climate scenarios."

Indonesia and Malaysia are the highest producers of palm oil in the world, supplying 83% of the global demand. Although palm oil production is crucial in the region, the factors driving regional variation in palm oil yield remain unclear, with in-situ evidence indicating that management practices, climatic conditions, stand age, and the presence of peatland are the potential factors. In the current study, the spatiotemporal variation of the actual palm oil yield across Indonesia and Malaysia in the past 20 years was evaluated using national survey data, remote sensing, and machine learning. Our results indicate that 95% of plantations in the region experienced yield increases, with an average rate of 0.14 ± 0.09 ton ha−1 yr−1. Climatic conditions were identified as the primary drivers of yield, followed by management practices (i.e. industrial and smallholder). The optimal temperature for palm oil production is approximately 25 °C, and 93% of the plantation areas exceeded this figure. Meanwhile, precipitation generally enhanced yield, with peatland plantations being more sensitive to precipitation than non-peatland plantations. These findings delineate the key factors influencing palm oil yield variability and provide critical insights for improving management strategies and planning in the world’s largest palm oil-producing regions."

Phenological monitoring allows us to understand the vegetation responses to the effects of climate change. This study examines tropical forest phenology in the Brazilian Amazon using the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), which observes tropical and temperate forests using a self-contained laser altimeter on the International Space Station. The plant area index (PAI) from the GEDI laser product, measured at every 5 m from the ground, was used to create an upper canopy and understory time-series PAI at 2° spatial resolution. Spline algorithms were employed to produce PAI time-series free of time gaps. These data were then utilized to identify the phenological timing of both the upper canopy and understory layers. The results revealed that upper canopy PAI consistently increased during early dry seasons, while understory PAI likely increased due to sunlight that penetrated the upper canopy during its leaf abscission period in the late dry season. The phenological timing within the Brazilian Amazon varied in both space and year. Upper canopy and understory phenological cycles sometimes widen or narrow, occasionally resulting in two cycles per year in some regions. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of using GEDI data to study the phenology of the Brazilian Amazon."

Industrial decarbonization policies have therefore emerged as critical components of any attempt to achieve net-zero energy transitions. However, little research has examined the effectiveness of those industrial decarbonization policies. We fill this gap by examining trends in industrial greenhouse gas emissions and whether industrial decarbonization policies (and particular policy instruments) are effective in reducing industrial sector emissions. We use panel data from 150 nations from 1990 to 2020 to examine the effect of industrial decarbonization policy instruments (drawing from an inventory of more than 700 policies across different countries) on industrial greenhouse gas emissions. We find that Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Cuba experienced the largest decreases in industrial emissions, whereas developing countries in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Kuwait experienced the greatest growth in emissions. We also find that industrial decarbonization policy leads to reductions in industrial greenhouse gas emissions, and that these effects are primarily driven by two policy types: (1) payments, finance, and taxation and (2) strategic plans. We also find some (but inconsistent) evidence that (1) regulation, (2) grants, (3) codes and standards, (4) minimum energy performance standards, (5) voluntary approaches, and (6) negotiated agreements (public–private sector) are associated with a reduction in emissions and that (1) payments and transfers, (2) information and education, and (3) targets, plans, and framework legislation may be associated with decreases or increases in emissions. By using dynamic modeling and event study approaches, we observe that the introduction of industrial decarbonization policy has persistent effects well into the future. The effect of each additional policy lasts between 4–19 years, and the effects of payments, finance, and taxation and strategic planning policies last between 4–18 years on average."

One prominent CDR approach is enhanced weathering (EW), in which crushed silicate rock is applied on land or in the open ocean to accelerate natural weathering processes that absorb carbon dioxide from Earth’s ocean–atmosphere system. However, in addition to a range of potential environmental, socioeconomic, and ethical issues associated with this pathway, bottlenecks in feedstock sourcing represent a key barrier for deployment of EW at scale. Here, we evaluate the potential of silicate wastes produced from industrial processes—such as steel slag and cement waste—as feedstocks for the EW process. An empirical model that links industrial alkaline waste production to gross domestic product at purchase power parity is developed to forecast waste production in the alternative futures described by the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) framework. By incorporating these results into an intermediate-complexity Earth system model, we also explore the impacts of EW using industrial waste on changes to global temperature, ocean pH, and ocean aragonite saturation state, while also quantifying overall CDR efficiency through the end of the century. We estimate a maximum cumulative end-of-century capture potential of ∼400 GtCO2 for industrial waste, which could represent a significant fraction of the projected CDR requirement of many mitigation scenarios in the SSP framework.

Using satellite observations and meteorological data, we demonstrate that the inverted V primarily reflects co-variability between LWP and Nd. We suggest taking a holistic approach that considers this co-variability when assessing the climatological sensitivity of LWP to anthropogenic aerosols. 
 Climatological data of the liquid water path (LWP) and droplet concentration (Nd) often reveal an inverted-V relationship, where LWP increases and then decreases as Nd increases. Our findings show that while this LWP response to an increase in Nd aligns with proposed causal mechanisms, such as entrainment evaporation feedback and precipitation suppression, the inverted-V pattern is primarily driven by the co-variability between LWP and Nd. This co-variability arises from (1) large-scale meteorology, which controls both LWP and Nd, causing them to vary in opposite directions simultaneously, and (2) microphysical processes, where an increase in LWP is typically accompanied by a decrease in Nd. Consequently, we suggest that the inverted-V sensitivity should not be used as evidence for positive radiative forcing through LWP adjustments to aerosols as it is largely explained by co-variability. We further demonstrate that the inverted-V relationship essentially reflects the climatological evolution of Stratocumulus clouds (Sc). Therefore, background anthropogenic changes in Nd should, in principle, be reflected in the redistribution of occurrences across the inverted V while maintaining its shape."

 This study presents the unique capability of the Department of Energy (DOE) ArcticShark – a mid-size fixed-wing uncrewed aerial system (UAS) – for measuring vertically resolved atmospheric properties over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of the United States. Focusing on atmospheric states, such as ambient temperature, wind, and aerosol properties, we overview measurements from 32 research flights (∼ 97 flight hours) in 2023. The August operations, aided by a visual observer on a chase plane, allowed for extensive UAS coverage, surpassing typical UAS operation envelopes. Our data from March, June, and August 2023 reveal distinctive seasonal patterns within the atmospheric column through unique chemical composition measurements. In situ measurements combined with remote sensing retrievals and radiosonde measurements provided valuable insights into their consistency and complementarity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of the ArcticShark through several case studies, including the analyses of correlations between UAS-derived atmospheric profiles and conventional radiosonde measurements, as well as the derivation of vertically resolved profiles of aerosol chemical, optical, and microphysical properties. These case studies highlight the versatility of the ArcticShark UAS as a powerful tool for comprehensive atmospheric research, effectively bridging data gaps and enhancing our understanding of vertical atmospheric structures in the region."

Here, we present data on benthic fluxes of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) from the Baltic Sea, an area with a long eutrophication history. The presented dataset contains 499 individual fluxes measured in situ with three types of benthic chamber landers at 59 stations over 20 years, and data cover most of the Baltic Sea sub-basins (Hylén et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14812160). The dataset further contains information about bottom-water dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations, sedimentary organic carbon (OC) content and sediment type. The DIP fluxes differ considerably between basins depending on OC loading and the level of O2 depletion and generally increase from the coast to the central basins. Several stations have been visited on multiple occasions, also at times with different O2 concentrations, which enables investigation of the immediate effects of shifting bottom-water O2 concentrations on the benthic DIP release. The Baltic Sea-wide benthic DIP release is estimated to be 391 – 489 kton y-1 based on a data integration based on sediment type and O2 conditions during three years with varying extents of hypoxia and anoxia (2004, 2013 and 2018). The dataset reveals a lack of flux measurements in winter months, coastal areas and sandy sediments; these should be targeted in future studies. Overall, the data is of high quality and will be important for marine management and studies on mechanisms in benthic phosphorus cycling."

The degree of industrial food processing has been associated with higher organophosphorus flame retardant (PFR) and plasticizer contamination. Here, the occurrence of these contaminants in NPBFs was investigated by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Our findings show differences in contamination levels and patterns between PB food categories, with PB cheese-alternatives showing the highest levels of both total PFRs (mean: 123 ng/g ww) and total plasticizers (mean: 1155 ng/g ww). The results further point to food contact material and industrial processing as possible contamination sources. Compared with previous studies of ABFs, NPBFs generally showed higher contamination levels, leading to a higher dietary exposure in a vegan diet scenario. While the adult population is not at immediate risk following NPBF consumption, based on these results, a direct replacement of all ABFs with NPBFs is not recommended. Additionally, it is suggested that different PB food categories be included in future food studies monitoring dietary exposure."

Results show that the Hg storage in surface soil increases by 3.2 times over 250 years after the glacier retreated. 53 ± 11% of Hg in grass shoots is from the uptake of atmospheric Hg0 and 47 ± 11%, from the uptake of soil Hg. Atmospheric Hg2+ is the primary source of surface soil Hg (54 ± 13%), followed by atmospheric Hg0 (40 ± 10%) and geogenic Hg. The Hg accumulation in soils increased by a factor of 5 at an accelerating rate from the 1870s to 2010s. The Hg release flux from melting glaciers is 3.51 ± 0.01 μg m–2 yr–1. The highly positive Δ199Hg (1.03 ± 0.49‰) in precipitation due to photoreduction of Hg2+ in water droplets causes all samples in ecosystems to have positive Δ199Hg values.

In this study, a novel prototype H2 sensor was deployed in a state-of-the-art mobile laboratory to demonstrate that H2 emissions can be accurately quantified using downwind measurement techniques and analytics commonly used for other gases. A series of controlled H2 release experiments were conducted with the corelease of multiple tracer gases. Tracer flux ratio and physics-based Bayesian plume model inversion methodologies were used to quantify the H2 emission rates. We show that the H2 sensor detects parts-per-billion or higher concentration enhancements downwind of the H2 emission source within seconds, and the similar plume structures of H2 and tracer gases confirm their codispersion in the atmosphere.

However, the potential human exposure to contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) through plant accumulation is a significant barrier. Currently, knowledge on CEC contamination of edible produce and effective mitigation strategies for the safe reuse of TWW is limited, particularly under field conditions. This study examined the accumulation of a representative set of CECs, including perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and tire wear particle (TWP) chemicals, in radish, lettuce, and tomato under three irrigation practices: FULL (continuous TWW irrigation), HALF (midseason switch from TWW to FW), and FW-only. Despite low PFAS concentrations (8.1–25.7 ng/L) in TWW, the plant uptake was consistently observed, including in tomato fruits. Alternating TWW with FW significantly reduced CEC accumulation in edible tissues, particularly for compounds with short half-lives, with reductions up to 82.4% even for persistent PFAS. For most CECs and plant species, edible tissue concentrations were similar between the HALF and FW treatments. These findings demonstrate the on-farm applicability of simple irrigation modifications to reduce food contamination and contribute to the promotion of safe reuse of nonconventional waters."

Herein, submicron ZVI particles were phosphatized to produce phosphatized ZVI (P-ZVI), which was employed to activate peroxydisulfate (PDS) for phenol degradation. As anticipated, phosphatization significantly enhanced both the storage stability (>10 months vs 1 d) and catalytic activity (4.37 vs 0.12 L m–2 h–1) of ZVI compared to unphosphatized counterparts attributed to the formation of a crystalline Fe3P shell on P-ZVI. This Fe3P shell selectively interacts with H2O/O2/PDS, maintaining the stability of P-ZVI under high humidity and oxygen conditions while creating mass transfer channels that enhance reactivity in the presence of PDS. Characterization results from the reaction process demonstrated that the Fe3P shell activated PDS through both direct (via Fe cations) and indirect pathways (through a phosphorus anion-mediated Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle), generating reactive species and facilitating mass transfer between core Fe0 and external PDS for efficient PDS activation and phenol degradation. This study elucidates how constructing an Fe3P shell can realize selective activation of PDS while simultaneously enhancing both the storage and catalytic stabilities of ZVI, thereby boosting the practical application of PDS-based advanced oxidation processes in various environmental remediation."

Here we evaluate data from two Canadian air monitoring programs in which front and back PUF traps (P1 and P2) were used to check for breakthrough, as indicated by the back/front ratio (P2/P1) of collected SVOCs.

Previous studies, based on geophysical and xenolith evidence, mainly suggest that MLDs are formed through metamorphic processes and have low strength. This raises the question of how most cratons remain stable with weak MLDs. Using numerical models and theoretical analysis, we show that the spatial distribution of MLDs can influence cratonic behavior during plate motion. Mantle flow can shear the cratonic root along a weak, laterally continuous MLD, leading to cratonic destruction. However, when the MLDs are laterally intermittent and contain several 10's–1,000's km‐wide gaps, especially near the side boundaries, they can generate a viscous coupling that can counterbalance the basal traction force from mantle flow and contribute to stabilizing the cratons."

Traditionally, trend assessments have been limited to total evaporative demand, overlooking shifts in daily extremes, which are meaningful for agrohydrological outcomes yet largely unknown. Here, using a fully physical metric of evaporative demand, that is, standardized short crop reference evapotranspiration, we introduce the concept of thirstwaves—prolonged periods of extremely high evaporative demand—and analyze their characteristics during 1981–2021 growing seasons for the conterminous US. Findings show that long‐term mean spatial patterns demonstrated by thirstwave characteristics do not follow that of total or mean evaporative demand. Weighted for cropland area harvested, thirstwave intensity, duration, and frequency have increased by 0.06 mm d−1 decade−1, 0.10 days decade−1, and 0.39 events decade−1, respectively during 1981–2021.

Not only have thirstwaves increased in severity, but the likelihood of no thirstwaves occurring during the growing season has significantly decreased.

A large source of model uncertainty originates from the Earth system models used to force FishMIP models, particularly future changes to lower trophic level biomass and sea‐ice coverage. To build confidence in regional MEMs as ecosystem‐based management tools in a changing climate that can better account for uncertainty, we propose the development of a Southern Ocean Marine Ecosystem Model Ensemble (SOMEME) contributing to the FishMIP 2.0 regional model intercomparison initiative. One of the challenges hampering progress of regional MEM ensembles is achieving the balance of global standardised inputs with regional relevance. As a first step, we design a SOMEME simulation protocol, that builds on and extends the existing FishMIP framework, in stages that include: detailed skill assessment of climate forcing variables for Southern Ocean regions, extension of fishing forcing data to include whaling, and new simulations that assess ecological links to sea‐ice processes in an ensemble of candidate regional MEMs. These extensions will help advance assessments of urgently needed climate change impacts on Southern Ocean ecosystems."

Although biodiversity and ecosystem services are tightly interlinked and interact in complex ways, a uniform global or national target has long ignored their interdependencies and uneven distribution to guide region‐ or ecoregion‐specific planning. Here, we use a flexible and stepwise approach, incorporating high conservation values of biodiversity, carbon and water and their complex interactions, to identify three targeted priority areas at regional and ecological jurisdictions on the Qinghai‐Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We find that 49% of the targeted priority areas could effectively protect about 60% of biodiversity, carbon, and water at the ecoregion scale. However, at the regional scale, 48% of the targeted priority areas have the potential to conserve up to 70% of biodiversity, carbon and water. Although the QTP has achieved the target three of the Kunming‐Montreal GBF (i.e., to protect 30% of areas), more than 75% and 70% of priority areas remain unprotected at the regional and ecoregion scales, respectively. More importantly, over 55% of the unprotected priority areas at the regional scale are under moderate to high human pressure. Our spatially explicit insights demonstrate the importance of expanding existing protected areas on the QTP, while highlighting the potential of targeted conservation initiatives at the subnational level to ensure the Kunming‐Montreal GBF in a more efficient manner."

Blanchard,The Ocean System Pathways (OSPs): A New Scenario and Simulation Framework to Investigate the Future of the World Fisheries,"The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystems Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) has dedicated a decade to unraveling the future impacts of climate change on marine animal biomass. FishMIP is now preparing a new simulation protocol to assess the combined effects of both climate and socio‐economic changes on marine fisheries and ecosystems. This protocol will be based on the Ocean System Pathways (OSPs), a new set of socio‐economic scenarios derived from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) widely used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The OSPs extend the SSPs to the economic, governance, management and socio‐cultural contexts of large pelagic, small pelagic, benthic‐demersal and emerging fisheries, as well as mariculture. Comprising qualitative storylines, quantitative model driver pathways and a “plug‐in‐model” framework, the OSPs will enable a heterogeneous suite of ecosystem models to simulate fisheries dynamics in a standardised way. This paper introduces this OSP framework and the simulation protocol that FishMIP will implement to explore future ocean social‐ecological systems holistically, with a focus on critical issues such as climate justice, global food security, equitable fisheries, aquaculture development, fisheries management, and biodiversity conservation. Ultimately, the OSP framework is tailored to contribute to the synthesis work of the IPCC. It also aims to inform ongoing policy processes within the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Finally, it seeks to support the synthesis work of the Intergovernmental Science‐Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), with a particular focus on studying pathways relevant for the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity."

To achieve this, many countries have made net zero greenhouse gas emissions targets, with the aim of halting global warming and stabilizing the climate. Here, we analyze the stability of global and local temperatures in an ensemble of simulations from the zero‐emissions commitment Model Intercomparison Project, where CO2 emissions are abruptly ceased. Our findings show that at both the global and local level stabilization does not occur immediately after net zero CO2 emissions. The multi‐model median (mean) global average temperature stabilizes after approximately 90 (124) years, with an inter‐model range of 64–330 years. However, for some models, this may underestimate the actual time to become stable, as this is the end of the simulation. Seven models exhibited cooling post‐emission cessation, with two of the models then warming after the initial cooling. One model gradually warmed through the entire simulation, while another had alternating cooling and warming. At the local level, responses varied significantly, with many models simulating the reversal of trends in some areas. Changes at the local level, at many locations, continue beyond the stabilization of global temperature and are not stable by the end of the simulations."

A network analysis of annual log‐transformed WNV case numbers (2003–2022) generated four spatially and temporally coherent clusters among 48 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 were the largest groups corresponding to the Central Flyway and the closely associated Eastern Flyway (with an east‐coast subset). Cluster 2 and Cluster 4 corresponded with less‐well defined segments of a distinctly different Western Flyway. Thus, clustering can be explained by migratory pathways of terrestrial birds. We investigated avian involvement in the spread of WNV from potential sources in the southern U.S. Analyses revealed consistent patterns in log‐transformed case numbers of human WNV. This study highlights the significant role of migratory birds in shaping the spatiotemporal patterns of WNV incidence across North America. However, the observed variability in incidence also likely reflects the interplay of other factors including local environmental conditions, mosquito populations, and regional variations in both migratory and non‐migratory bird populations."

 Weather prediction is critical for a range of human activities including transportation, agriculture and industry, as well as the safety of the general public. Machine learning is transforming numerical weather prediction (NWP) by replacing the numerical solver with neural networks, improving the speed and accuracy of the forecasting component of the prediction pipeline 1,2,3,4,5,6. However, current models rely on numerical systems at initialisation and to produce local forecasts, limiting their achievable gains. Here we show that a single machine learning model can replace the entire NWP pipeline. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system, ingests observations and produces global gridded forecasts and local station forecasts. The global forecasts outperform an operational NWP baseline for multiple variables and lead times. The local station forecasts are skillful up to ten days lead time, competing with a post-processed global NWP baseline and a state-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting system with input from human forecasters. End-to-end tuning further improves the accuracy of local forecasts. Our results show that skillful forecasting is possible without relying on NWP at deployment time, which will enable the full speed and accuracy benefits of data-driven models to be realised. We believe Aardvark Weather will be the starting point for a new generation of end-to-end models that will reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude, and enable rapid, affordable creation of customised models for a range of end-users."

 In patients with atrophic age-related macular degeneration, subretinal photovoltaic implant (PRIMA) provided visual acuity up to 20/440, matching its 100 µm pixels size. Next-generation implants with smaller pixels should significantly improve the acuity. This study in rats evaluates removal of a subretinal implant, replacement with a newer device, and the resulting grating acuity in-vivo. Six weeks after the initial implantation with planar and 3-dimensional devices, the retina was re-detached, and the devices were successfully removed. Histology demonstrated a preserved inner nuclear layer. Re-implantation of new devices into the same location demonstrated retinal re-attachment to a new implant. New devices with 22 µm pixels increased the grating acuity from the 100 µm capability of PRIMA implants to 28 µm, reaching the limit of natural resolution in rats. Reimplanted devices exhibited the same stimulation threshold as for the first implantation of the same implants in a control group.

 Heat stress inhibits photosynthesis efficiency, thereby suppressing plant growth and crop yield. However, the mechanism underlying this inhibition is not fully understood. Here, we report that the multiple organellar RNA-editing factor 8 (MORF8) forms condensates with solid-like properties in chloroplasts upon heat stress. In vitro data show that the MORF8 condensation is intrinsically heat-dependent and primarily determined by its IDR (intrinsically disordered region). Purification and characterization of MORF8 condensates show that numerous editing factors including PPR proteins and MORFs are partitioned. We provide both genetic and biochemical evidence that MORF8 condensation inhibits chloroplast RNA editing. In agreement, we find that both heat stress and MORF8 condensation lead to reduced editing of RNAs encoding NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex and impaired NDH activity and photosynthesis efficiency. These findings uncover MORF8 as a putative chloroplastic thermosensor that mediates photosynthesis inhibition by heat and highlight the functional significance of solid material properties of biomolecular condensates. How plants perceive and respond to heat stress via chloroplast is obscure.

 We unravel the response of terrestrial ecosystems in India to Tropical Cyclones (TCs) originating in the North Indian Ocean (NIO). We find that about 34.6% of TCs drove greening and 65.4% caused browning response of vegetation during 2000–2020. TC-induced greening is more likely for TCs originated in pre-monsoon (100%) or monsoon (62.5%) than post-monsoon with large browning response (94%). Rainfall by TCs increases soil moisture (SM) and reduces climatic water deficit (CWD) for a moisture-stressed region, and its effective utilisation by vegetation triggers the greening response. Granger Causality reveals that TC-induced rain and greening response exhibit a maximum temporal lag of 40 days. The favourable vegetation response to TCs is a new insight as it sheds light on the complex Atmosphere-Land-Ocean (ALO) interactions on a regional scale.

Temperature extremes under strong El Niño intensify in the future in some regions, with more cool days in eastern North America, while warm days in northern South America decrease. Assuming that the characteristics of strong El Niño events will not change in the future, we distinguish between changes in El Niño teleconnections and background climate changes, and found that the latter dominates the absolute climate response to strong El Niño events."

 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was identified as the dominant factor influencing the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), especially after the mid-1970s when the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) response remarkably strengthened. Here, we find that the influence of ENSO on the EASM has been diminishing since the early 2000s. The EASM in wind anomalies associated with the positive phase of ENSO quickly disintegrates in August, changing from an anticyclone over the western North Pacific (WNPAC) to a cyclone over the western North Pacific (WNP), which exerts significant influence on the East Asia rainfall. These weakened EASM responses are closely linked to the changes in ENSO’s rate of decay around the early 2000s. During 1977–1999, ENSO events peaking in the boreal winter frequently display a gradual decay, triggering robust positive ocean–atmosphere feedback, which extends beyond the TIO and involves the WNP. The resultant North Indian Ocean (NIO) warming develops and persists through the decaying summer, maintaining the WNPAC in August. In contrast, ENSO events exhibit a faster decay during 2000–2022, leading to a weakened ENSO-induced TIO feedback. Additionally, the WNP warms up, accompanied by the collapse of the easterly wind response, contributing to the weak summer peak in the NIO. In turn, the weak NIO warming rapidly decays, which cannot sustain the WNPAC in August. This study emphasizes the crucial role of WNP air–sea coupling in the changing influences of ENSO on the EASM."

 Seasonal climate forecasting is important for societal welfare, as it supports decision-makers in taking proactive steps to mitigate risks from adverse climate conditions or to take advantage of favorable ones. Here, we introduce TelNet, a sequence-to-sequence machine learning model for short-to-medium lead seasonal precipitation forecasting. The model takes past seasonal precipitation values and climate indices to predict an empirical precipitation distribution for every grid point of the target region for the next six overlapping seasons. TelNet has a simple encoder-decoder-head architecture, allowing the model to be trained with a limited amount of data, as is often the case in climate forecasting. Its deterministic and probabilistic performance is thoroughly evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art dynamical and deep learning models in a prominent region for seasonal forecasting studies due to its high climate predictability. The training, validation, and test sets are resampled multiple times to estimate the uncertainty associated with a small dataset. The results show that TelNet ranks among the most accurate and calibrated models across multiple initialization months and lead times, especially during the rainy season when the predictable signal is strongest. Moreover, the model allows instance- and lead-wise forecast interpretation through its variable selection weights.

 Subglacial hydrology plays an important role in controlling glacier behaviour, influencing glacier retreat and the resulting contributions to sea level rise. Here we present a detailed seasonal data set from four soft-bedded temperate glaciers and demonstrate a continuum of subglacial hydrology from channelized to a multichannel distributed behaviour. Our results illustrate how this continuum may be affected by till grain size and subaqueous processes, and we quantify the relative timings of basal sliding and deformation. These different hydrologies have a distinctive seasonal velocity pattern, which although have been identified using a multi-data stream, we suggest can be classified using solely Sentinel-1 satellite-based glacier velocity data.

 Wildfires exhibit extensive nonlinear characteristics and threshold effects in response to environmental changes. However, how threshold effects affect wildfire responses and their future changes remains unclear. Here we identified thresholds where wildfire-driver relationships shift and estimated the impact of threshold effects on wildfire dynamics in the 21st century in northern mid- and high latitudes (>30°N). Wildfire-driver thresholds, coregulated by gradient differences in heat and moisture conditions, vegetation productivity, and human activities, effectively explain the spatial patterns and uneven responses of wildfires. Despite the dominance of temperature, precipitation, and socioeconomic status on wildfires, 30.70% of wildfire changes are attributed to their threshold effects, notably in boreal and temperate ecosystems. Climate change will enhance the threshold effects of wildfire drivers, leading to a 47.81 ± 3.08% increase in burned areas by 2030–2100 compared with 2001‒2022.

 Infrastructure across the circumpolar Arctic is exposed to permafrost thaw hazards caused by global warming and human activity, creating the risk of damage and economic losses. However, losses are underestimated in existing literature due to incomprehensive infrastructure maps. Here, we mapped infrastructure from 0.5 m resolution satellite imagery of 285 Alaskan communities with a deep learning detection model. Combined with OpenStreetMap, we mapped a statewide Alaskan building footprint of 53 M m2 and a road network of 50,477 km. With deep learning, we expanded the OpenStreetMap building footprint by 47% statewide and 86% on discontinuous and continuous permafrost. Doubling the amount found in existing literature by using our improved map, we estimated that building and road losses due to permafrost thaw could cost Alaska $37B to $51B under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. Finally, we highlight shortcomings in U.S. national risk assessments, which do not account for Alaskan permafrost hazards.

 The artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecast foundation models can infer and generate precise global atmospheric state forecasts on the user’s device and with speed over 10,000 times faster than the operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), and it is making increasingly significant contributions to geodetic applications represented by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). However, existing studies on the investigation of these AI models are typically carried out by concentrating on specific one or several meteorological events in certain regions or by comparison with physical models, and the evaluation results obtained in this manner are not comprehensive and universal. Additionally, we find that the results obtained by the foundation models through the “rollout” method for forecasting are not uniform in terms of time and space. This temporal and spatial inhomogeneity of accuracy and accuracy degradation are related to AI algorithms and attributes of training data, etc., but these characteristics have not been thoroughly explored and analyzed. In this study, we obtained the global forecast results of foundation models for 2022 and subsequently derived the GNSS tropospheric delay through numerical integration. We calculated the mean deviation, mean absolute error, and root mean square error of these data. Using these metrics, we analyzed the spatiotemporal inhomogeneity in the accuracy degradation of foundation models, represented by Huawei Cloud Pangu-Weather, Google DeepMind GraphCast, and Shanghai AI Lab FengWu. We evaluated how this inhomogeneity changes with forecast time and identified the best-performing models across different regions and forecast durations. From the results, we find that taking topography into account when training the model enhances its accuracy at high altitudes, and the facilitating influence between the high related atmospheric variables such as precipitation and water vapor. The contributions of this study are twofold: it serves as a valuable reference for geodetic and remote sensing users employing foundational models, and offers insights and case supports for AI practitioners aiming to develop more accurate models for weather forecasting."

 Wildfires significantly reshape the landscape of the Mediterranean basin, altering forest composition, structure, and diversity. Consequently, detailed fuel mapping is crucial for improving fire risk assessment and enhancing fire behavior modeling, as wildfires typically ignite from surface fuels and may spread vertically to canopy fuels due to canopy fuel continuity. This study generates a fuel type map of the overstory and understory based on the FirEUrisk hierarchical fuel classification system (FHFCS) in three steps, including overstory mapping using multispectral and radar data (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), and topographic variables; shrubland and grassland height estimation using biophysical models based on precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); and understory mapping using spaceborne LiDAR data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) and decision rules. An Overall Accuracy (OA) of 84.53% was achieved for overstory mapping for the composition of Vegetation Indices (VIs), Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textures, vertical transmit–horizontal receive (VH) of Sentinel-1, and elevation, integrated with biophysical models. Cropland, urban, non-fuel, and various forest classes, particularly evergreen needle-leaved forests, demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving F1 scores ranging from 83% to 100%.

 High-accuracy digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential for remote sensing and geospatial analysis, yet integrating multi-source data over large and complex terrains remains challenging. To address these challenges, this study presents the Multi-source Data Joint Processing (MDJP) framework. This framework establishes a systematic way for correcting DEM errors of varying quality and integrating multi-source data, leveraging deep learning-based calibration and spatially adaptive fusion techniques to enhance DEM accuracy and consistency in large and complex regions. For calibration, our proposed DEM calibration model (DemFormer) combines a lightweight Transformer module with a bagging decision-tree network in a stacking framework, specifically designed to enhance the stability and accuracy of DEM elevation error predictions. For fusion, our DEM fusion model (DemFusion) employs spatial autocorrelation analysis and KD-Tree clustering to compute optimal fusion weights, effectively integrating complementary elevation information from multiple DEM sources. We evaluate the MDJP framework using four widely used global DEMs—Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X), Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D-30 m (AW3D30)—each at 1-arc second (∼30 m) resolution. The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) elevation data serves as the independent reference dataset for assessment. Our experiments, conducted in Guangdong Province, China, and the Northern Territory of Australia, demonstrate that the DemFormer model reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by 18.38 %, 17.28 %, 54.53 %, and 65.24 % for TanDEM-X, AW3D30, SRTM, and ASTER, respectively. Furthermore, the DemFusion model further refines the results, and the fused DEM had better accuracy than other DEMs in Guangdong and the Northern Territory. These findings underscore the robustness of our approach and establish a new benchmark for DEM calibration and fusion, with significant implications for geospatial analysis and environmental monitoring."

 Multiple satellites are currently in orbit around the Earth, providing reliable and consistent estimates of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2, i.e., XCO2. However, the satellite datasets suffer spatiotemporal gaps due to the narrow swath widths and the influence of clouds and aerosols. Model-derived CO2 datasets can fill these gaps; however, these model datasets lack the consistency of the satellite observations. Scientists are continually refining their methods to improve the accuracy of the model datasets. Therefore, regular evaluation of the model estimates against precise datasets is imperative to confirm their reliability. In our study, we extensively evaluated the performance of two widely used models, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) CarbonTracker and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), by comparing their CO2 datasets with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3) XCO2 retrievals utilizing three years of data from 2020 to 2022.

 The absence of in situ precipitation data in remote small and medium watersheds (SMWs) highlights the need for reliable satellite precipitation estimations (SPEs). This study evaluates and compares the updated Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) V07 Final Run uncalibrated (V07F-Uncal) and calibrated (V07F-Cal) products against their predecessors (V06F-Uncal and V06F-Cal). The comparison is conducted across 339 SMWs in Chinese humid regions during the summers from 2015 to 2020, using rain gauge observations as benchmarks. Conditional multivariate regression is employed to examine the relationships between satellite precipitation bias values and factors such as precipitation intensity, surface temperature, and fraction of vegetation cover (FVC). Results show that V07F-Uncal outperforms V06F-Uncal in terms of CC and RMSE in most mountainous and coastal SMWs, but it consistently underestimates precipitation, particularly in the mountainous regions. Bias for both V07F-Uncal and V06F-Uncal transitions from positive to increasingly negative values with rising precipitation intensity. V07F-Uncal exhibits a tighter distribution of bias values across all intensity categories compared to V06F-Uncal, but it shows a pronounced negative bias in high-intensity categories. In terms of performance metrics and the distribution of bias values, V06F-Cal demonstrates marked improvements over V06F-Uncal. However, the enhancements observed in V07F-Cal relative to V07F-Uncal are not substantial. As for the variability of bias values associated with changes in precipitation intensity, surface temperature and FVC, the explained bias variability in V07F-Uncal is significantly higher than in V06F-Uncal, averaging approximately 43 % versus 22 %. In western mountainous SMWs, this variability is also greater than in the eastern region (52 % versus 34 %). Precipitation intensity is the primary factor explaining bias variability for both V07F-Uncal and V06F-Uncal, although in specific regions, the bias variability of V06F-Uncal may relate to the surface temperature or its interaction with precipitation intensity. FVC exerts minimal influence (<3 %) on bias variability for both products. This research is crucial for improving the accuracy of SPEs in SMWs, which are vital for flood simulation and disaster adaptation in ungauged SMWs."

 The Indian Lightning Location Network (ILLN), established by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), provides a comprehensive framework for investigating lightning phenomena, thunderstorm dynamics, and associated nowcasting/forecasting methodologies. ILLN is a ground-based lightning location system operating in VLF/LF/HF radio frequency bands, facilitating effective nationwide lightning mitigation strategies. The detection accuracy of ILLN was thoroughly evaluated using a comprehensive approach, including ground-based observations with electric field mills (EFMs) and C-band polarimetric radar, alongside satellite data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission and the ISS Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS). The findings reveal that the ILLN exhibits a Relative Detection Efficiency (RDE) of 67.6 % in Pune, 69.4 % in Kohima, and 64.9 % in Rampurhat compared to electric field mill observations, closely aligned during high lightning activity during significant numbers of electric field changes. The average RDE for ILLN with reference to EFM is approximately 60 %, with lower values potentially due to a predominance of intra-cloud (IC) lightning. Lightning flashes detected by ILLN are primarily located within high reflectivity areas detected by GPM and ground radar, concentrated in regions exceeding 30 dBZ. Spatial RDE values concerning ISS ranged from 43 % to 97 %, with quartiles between 55 % and 84 % and median values between 67 % and 85 % across different cases, indicating occasional lower detection of IC lightning by ISS compared to ILLN. Factors such as IC:CG ratios may impact ISS-LIS detection, influencing discrepancies in the spatial pattern between ILLN and ISS over Northwest and Eastern regions. Despite minor regional differences, the overall alignment between ISS and ILLN lightning detections is close. These findings underscore the challenges and reliability of lightning detection methods, highlighting ILLN's consistent performance across diverse scenarios. The network's robust detection efficiency reinforces its utility for diverse applications, serving as a pivotal data source for esteemed organizations like the India Meteorological Department and national and state disaster management authorities. ILLN's widespread implementation significantly contributes to mitigating the adverse impact of lightning-induced incidents."

 The impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on thunderstorm properties, influenced by changes in air quality, were investigated in Northeastern (Kohima, 25.66° N, 94.08° E) and Eastern (Rampurhat, 24.17° N, 87.78° E) India using seven years of ground-based observations. During the lockdown period (LP), Cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes decreased by 67 % and 51 % over Kohima and Rampurhat respectively. Reductions were noted in the number of thunderstorms and various intensity parameters such as duration, flashes per thunderstorm, Peak Flash Rate (PFR), IC: CG ratio, and lightning peak currents. Significant changes in anthropogenic aerosols were observed, with notable reductions in SO₂, NO₂, and PM₁₀ levels. Regardless of the specific raindrop formation mechanism in the two regions, higher concentrations of moderate to larger raindrops were observed during LP. Also, the mixed-phase region of thunderstorms shows a reduction in water content (both liquid and ice) in the mixed phase and the total column. Daily-scale analysis reveals non-linear associations between pollutant concentrations and CG flashes in both regions, with relative humidity (RH) potentially influencing these relationships. Overall, thunderstorm intensity parameters, mixed-phase processes, and rain DSDs were associated with reduced pollutant concentrations during LP. The similarity of trends in multiple parameters during PLP-LP-ALP aligns with established facts, affirming that reduced pollutants lead to noticeable changes in thunderstorm characteristics. The partial rebound of pollutants and other parameters during ALP remained below pre-lockdown levels, which might suggest the lasting impacts of reduced human activities on atmospheric conditions. Further research is necessary to confirm if these measures could mitigate climatic changes and potentially guide policymakers in addressing such changes."

 This study investigates the spatial characteristics and prediction of Tropical Cyclone (TC)-induced storm surges at 18 coastal sites along the Guangdong and Hong Kong coasts when TCs are within 800 km of the sites, using the TC best-track datasets and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts datasets from 2009 to 2023. Innovatively, we developed a figure-based statistical model utilizing polar coordinates to determine TC positions relative to specific sites, with shadings denoting historical storm surge values at the site associated with TC intensity, position and size. The model for storm surges at the 18 sites induced by TCs was calibrated with data from 2009 to 2018 and validated with data from 2019 to 2022. Data from 2023 was used to test the model's predictive accuracy. Results show that TC intensity is a significant driver of storm surge, with higher-intensity TCs causing larger surges. Storm surges are influenced by TC azimuth and distance relative to the sites. TCs in the southeast and southwest quadrants, particularly within 600 km, generate more severe surges. Notably, TCs within 0–200 km of the sites, regardless of quadrant, pose the highest risk due to their high intensity around landfall. TC size and SLR also play crucial roles, with larger TCs and higher SLR values (computed using a 60-km radius) leading to larger surges. The figure-based statistical model effectively predicts TC-induced storm surges with minimal computational resources and provides a valuable tool for forecasting future storm surges, supporting disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts along the coast."

The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 inPlasmodium berghei(PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption ofpbsip2resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN4–6GTGCA).

Craniofacial integument displays dramatic diversity, exemplified by the Polish chicken (PC) with a homeotic transformation of comb-to-crest feathers, caused by a 195–base pair (bp) duplication inHoxC10intron. Micro-C analyses show that HoxC-containing topologically associating domain (TAD) is normally closed in the scalp but open in the dorsal and tail regions, allowing multiple long-distance contacts. In the PC scalp, the TAD is open, resulting in highHoxCexpression. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the 195-bp duplication reduces crest feather formation, andHoxCmisexpression alters feather shapes.

This process has traditionally been explained through the model of long-range Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In this study, we demonstrate a donor-to-acceptor short-range energy transfer (SRET) mechanism in OPV blends with non-fullerene acceptors, extending beyond the Förster approximation. This SRET occurs as a two-step process mediated by interfacial excitations with mixed charge-transfer and local excitation features. We further validate this model through studies on planar heterojunctions, precisely controlling the thickness of interlayers. These findings underscore the short-range interactions in regulating the donor-to-acceptor energy transfer in OPV blends, suggesting that SRET should be considered alongside FRET and charge-transfer processes for device optimizations."

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels are particularly attractive, but their preparation often requires toxic additives. Here, we introduced a nutritive sweetener,d-sorbitol, as a nontoxic additive to create soft and stretchable PEDOT:PSS conductive hydrogels. These hydrogels exhibit mechanical properties comparable with biological tissues, reducing adverse immune responses. The hydrogels can be patterned on elastic substrates using a simple, low-cost micromolding technique to fabricate soft and stretchable implantable devices for electrical stimulation and recording. The hydrogel electrodes show much lower electrochemical impedance and higher charge storage and injection capacity compared to platinum electrodes. In addition, the properties of hydrogels and devices remain stable after long-term storage and exposure to extreme conditions. We demonstrate the use of soft hydrogel-based electronic devices for effective electrical stimulation and high-quality electrical recordings in live animal models."

The synthesis of monazite, LaPO4, requires inconveniently high temperatures near 1000°C and generally involves the conversion of the presynthesized rhabdophane, LaPO4•nH2O, to the LaPO4monazite phase. During this structure transformation, the rhabdophane converts irreversibly to the thermodynamically stable monoclinic monazite structure. A low-temperature (185° to 260°C) mild hydrothermal acid-promoted synthesis of monazite is described that can both transform presynthesized rhabdophane or assemble reagents to the monoclinic monazite structure. The pH dependence of this reaction is detailed, and its applicability to theLnPO4(Ln= La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm-Gd), Ca0.5Th0.5PO4, and Sr0.5Th0.5PO4systems is discussed.

Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase renowned for mitochondrial quality control, has emerged as a regulator of immune response. Here, we show that both systemic and macrophage-specific ablations of Parkin in mice lead to attenuated tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5–dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment andPark2−/−signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor.

To further explore these mysteries, it is crucial to investigate another similar system beyond the two existing ones, SmB6and YbB12. Here, we address this by reporting on a Kondo insulator, U3Bi4Ni3. Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 kelvin and dominates transport properties below 150 kelvin, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB6and YbB12. At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected.

However, the presence of nonuniform geometric effects would be induced to impact the nonuniform geometric distribution of overpotential, leading to impurity dissolution and nonuniform Ti deposition. Here, in situ high-temperature characterizations on the molten salt electrorefining process are applied to establish an anodic dissolution principle for quantitatively evaluating nonuniform geometric effects of electrode. For eliminating the nonuniform geometric effects, coaxial anode-cathode configurations are designed to promote the nonuniform anodic dissolution and nonuniform cathodic deposition. Consequently, the geometric uniformity of titanium products on the cathodes is substantially enhanced, and thus, long-term stable electrorefining process (~12 hours, ~330% increment compared to the electrode of reference configuration) and highly purified titanium products (99.2%) are achieved."

To explore their potential as detectors for ultrabroadband terahertz electromagnetic pulses, we measure the transient optical birefringence the terahertz field induces. Notably, the signal component linear in the FM magnetization agrees excellently with the shape of the incident terahertz electric field at 1 to 13 terahertz and beyond. Analysis indicates that the birefringence arises from the terahertz-field–driven spin accumulation at the FM/HM interface through the spin Rashba-Edelstein effect (SREE). Because of spin-momentum locking, the SREE decays by electron momentum relaxation in <10 femtoseconds, substantially faster than a spin-Hall-effect–induced bulk spin accumulation. Our experiment demonstrates straightforward spintronic sampling of intense ultrabroadband terahertz fields with flat amplitude and phase response. Furthermore, it provides temporal signatures of the SREE and can be viewed as a versatile implementation of interface-specific terahertz time-domain spectroscopy."

The synchronization regions generally broaden monotonically with the strength of the forcing, thereby featuring a tongue-like shape in parameter space, known as Arnold’s tongue. Such a shape is universal, prevailing in many diverse synchronized systems. Theoretical studies suggest that, under strong external forcing, the shape of the synchronization regions can change substantially and even holes can appear in the solid patterns. However, experimentally accessing these abnormal regimes is quite challenging mainly because many real-world systems displaying synchronization become fragile under strong forcing. Here, we are able to observe these intriguing regimes in a breathing-soliton laser. Two types of abnormal synchronization regions are unveiled, namely, a leaf- and a ray-like shape. High-resolution control of the loss allows holes to be revealed in the synchronization regions. Our work opens the possibility to study intriguing synchronization dynamics using a simple breathing-soliton laser as a test bed."

Thus, supplementation with NAD+precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), exhibits beneficial effects against these disorders. However, the in vivo metabolic pathways of NMN and NR remain to be elucidated. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the fate of orally and intravenously administered NMN and NR in mice using NAD+metabolomics. We found that only a small portion of orally administered NMN and NR was directly absorbed from the small intestine and that most of them underwent gut microbiota–mediated deamidation and conversion to nicotinic acid (NA). Moreover, intravenously administered NMN and NR were rapidly degraded into nicotinamide and secreted to bile followed by deamidation to NA by gut microbiota. Thus, enterohepatic circulated NA is preferentially used in the liver. These findings showed that NMN and NR are indirectly converted to NAD+via unexpected metabolic pathways."

However, dysfunction and impairment of sensory nerves, accompanied by excessive inflammation impede tissue regeneration. Consequently, specific induction of sensory innervation to mediate immunoregulation becomes a promising therapeutic approach. Herein, we developed a cell/drug-free strategy to selectively boost endogenous sensory innervation to harness immune responses for promoting tissue rehabilitation. Specifically, a dual-functional phage was constructed with a sensory nerve–homing peptide and a β-subunit of nerve growth factor (β-NGF)–binding peptide. These double-displayed phages captured endogenic β-NGF and localized to sensory nerves to promote sensory innervation. Furthermore, regarding bone regeneration, phage-loaded hydrogels achieved rapid sensory nerve ingrowth in bone defect areas. Mechanistically, sensory neurotization facilitated M2 polarization of macrophages through the Sema3A/XIAP/PAX6 pathway, thus decreasing the M1/M2 ratio to induce the dissipation of local inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight the essential role of sensory innervation in manipulating inflammation and provide a conceptual framework based on neuroimmune interactions for promoting tissue regeneration."

Here, we propose a link between lipid metabolism and ERneg BC through phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo serine pathway. We demonstrate that the metabolism of the paradigmatic medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid leads to a metabolic shift toward the SOG and methionine pathways. PHGDH plays a role in both the forward direction, contributing to the production of S-adenosylmethionine, and the reverse direction, generating the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to epigenomic reprogramming and phenotypic plasticity. The methionine cycle is closely linked to the transsulfuration pathway. Consequently, we observe that the shift increases the antioxidant glutathione, which mitigates reactive oxygen species (ROS), enabling survival of a subset of cells that have undergone DNA damage.

Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out-of-equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids.
