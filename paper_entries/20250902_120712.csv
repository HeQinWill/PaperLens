Linear regression and machine learning models suggest that greater wind speeds and land slopes, particularly under uphill winds, are associated with increased fractions of coarser dust. Moreover, these positive correlations weaken during summer and afternoon events, probably related to the haboob storms. 
 The size of windblown dust particles plays a critical role in determining their geochemical and climate impacts. This study investigates the relationship between topographic wind conditions (speed and direction relative to land slope) and the particle size distribution (PSD) of dust emissions on a regional scale. We used the Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic Atmosphere Chemistry (MONARCH) dust reanalysis dataset, which assimilates satellite data on coarse-mode dust optical depth (DODcoarse). Validation against flight measurements from the 2011 Fennec campaign confirms the effectiveness of the reanalysis in capturing coarse to super coarse dust. A 10-year dust reanalysis underwent selective screening to identify events with fresh emissions and the fraction of coarse dust concentrations was calculated as a surrogate for size distribution. The coarse fractions and associated meteorological and land characteristics obtained from various datasets were incorporated into multiple linear regression and machine learning models. Results indicate that dust particle size increases with wind speed, probably due to a higher fraction of fresh emissions and reduced deposition of coarse dust under stronger winds. A positive correlation between dust size and uphill slope suggests that enhanced vertical transport of dust by topography outweighs the impact of shifting emission microphysics over veering winds. Both positive correlations weaken in the afternoons and summer, probably due to the turbulence during haboob storms, which can suspend coarse dust from aged emissions, competing with the effect of uphill slopes. These findings on dust size dependency on topographic winds could improve representation of dust cycle and its impacts."
10.5194/acp-25-9645-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了大气和海洋之间元素汞的交换过程，并利用长期地面监测站的观测数据和气团轨迹来研究这一过程。研究发现，大气汞的浓度随着气团在海洋边界层停留时间的增加而增加，这表明海洋排放直接影响大气汞的浓度。通过分析大气汞浓度与气团在海洋边界层停留时间的关系，研究估算了海洋表层溶解汞的浓度和海洋汞的排放通量。虽然该研究没有直接涉及卫星观测或遥感技术，但它利用地面监测数据来推断大气成分的变化，并评估海洋排放对大气环境的影响，因此与大气环境监测技术具有一定的相关性。,"['atmospheric mercury', 'air-sea exchange', 'ground-based monitoring', 'air mass trajectories', 'ocean emissions', 'atmospheric composition']",Koketso M.

Here, using atmospheric mercury observations from ground-based monitoring stations along with air mass trajectories, we found that atmospheric Hg levels increase with air mass ocean exposure time, matching predictions for ocean Hg emissions. This finding indicates that ocean emissions directly influence atmospheric Hg levels and enables us to estimate these emissions on a global scale. 
 Air–sea exchange of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) is a major component of the global mercury (Hg) biogeochemical cycle but remains poorly understood due to sparse in situ measurements. Here, we used long-term atmospheric Hg0 (Hgair0) observations combined with air mass back trajectories at four ground-based monitoring sites to study Hg0 air–sea exchange. The trajectories showed that all four sites sample mainly marine air masses. At all sites, we observed a gradual increase in mean Hgair0 concentration with air mass recent residence time in the marine boundary layer (MBL), followed by a steady state. The pattern is consistent with the thin-film gas exchange model, which predicts net Hg0 emissions from the surface ocean until the Hgair0 concentration normalised by Henry's law constant matches the surface ocean dissolved Hg0 (Hgaq0) concentration. This provides strong evidence that ocean Hg0 emissions directly influence Hgair0 concentrations at these sites. Using the observed relationship between Hgair0 concentrations and air mass recent MBL residence time, we estimated mean surface ocean Hgaq0 concentrations of 4–7 pg L−1 for the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans (AA) and 4 pg L−1 for the Southern, South Atlantic and south Indian oceans (SSI). Estimated ocean Hg0 emission fluxes ranged between 0.57–0.86 and 0.60–0.87 ngm-2h-1 for the AA and SSI, respectively, with a global extrapolated mean flux of around 2270 t yr−1 (1600–2900 t yr−1). This study demonstrates the applicability of long-term, ground-based Hgair0 observations in constraining Hg0 air–sea exchange."

Wright;Shenglong Zhang;Jiao Chen;Sean M. Davis;Paul Konopka;Mengqian Lu;Xiaolu Yan;Guang J. Zhang,Evaluating reanalysis representations of climatological trace gas distributions in the Asian monsoon tropopause layer,"Atmospheric reanalysis products reconstruct past states of the atmosphere. These products are often used to study winds and temperatures in the upper-level monsoon circulation, but their ability to reproduce composition fields like water vapor and ozone has been questionable at best. Here we report clear signs of improvement in both consistency across reanalyses and agreement with satellite observations, outline limitations, and suggest steps to further enhance the usefulness of these fields. 
 Trace gas distributions in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) have important radiative and chemical impacts on climate. Although researchers have traditionally shunned direct outputs from reanalysis products at these altitudes, a looming gap in satellite observations may soon render these products essential. Here we use data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and five meteorological and composition-focused reanalyses to address the following two questions. Can current reanalyses reproduce essential features of UTLS composition above the Asian summer monsoon (ASM)? If so, do they reproduce these distributions from internal physics and dynamics or depend on data assimilation? All evaluated reanalyses capture regional water vapor anomalies despite moist biases in the zonal mean. Reanalysis water vapor budgets reveal the expected balance between advective hydration and “cold-trap” dehydration near the cold point; however, data assimilation effects are also influential. The scientific utility of reanalysis water vapor fields at these altitudes could be enhanced by suppressing assimilation effects to facilitate the dominant “advection–condensation” balance, as is now done by ECMWF. The two reanalyses that provide CO show good agreement with observed convective enhancement, highlighting the value of including CO-like transport tracers in reanalyses. All five reanalyses also reproduce the seasonal “ozone valley” above the monsoon reasonably well, but the only reanalysis to provide a complete ozone budget relies heavily on data assimilation to do so. The composition reanalyses, with more sophisticated chemistry, provide a better match to ozone observations, but it remains unclear whether they can do so without Aura MLS."

Based on field measurement data, we built machine learning models to predict gas–particle partitioning. We also unveiled previously unrecognized interactions that led to the deviations of partitioning from the equilibrium state under real atmospheric conditions. Our study provided valuable insights for future research in atmospheric chemistry. 
 Gas–particle partitioning governs the fate of oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) and the formation of organic aerosols. We employed a Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer equipped with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsol (FIGAERO-CIMS) to measure the gas–particle distribution of OOMs in a winter campaign in the urban atmosphere. The observed gas–particle (G/P) ratios show a narrower range than the equilibrium G/P ratios predicted from saturation mass concentration C* and organic aerosol content. The difference between observed and equilibrium G/P ratios could be up to 10 orders of magnitude, depending on the C* parameterization selection. Our random forest models identified relative humidity (RH), aerosol liquid water content (LWC), temperature, and ozone as four influential factors driving the deviations of partitioning from the equilibrium state. Random forest models with satisfactory performance were developed to predict the observed G/P ratios. Intrinsic molecule features far outweigh meteorological and chemical composition features in the model's predictions. For a given OOM species, particle chemical composition features, including pH, RH, LWC, organic carbon, potassium, and sulfate, dominate over meteorological and gaseous chemical composition features in predicting the G/P ratios. We identified the positive or negative effects as well as the sensitive ranges of these influential features using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and curve fitting with a generalized additive model (GAM). Our models found that temperature does not emerge as a significant factor influencing the observed G/P ratios, suggesting that other factors, most likely associated with particle composition, inhibit the gas–particle partitioning of OOMs in response to temperature change."

Our results reveal that substantial wetting trends since the 21st century have mitigated O3 growth in this region, with the influence of wetting on O3 evolution outweighing the warming effect. These findings should be taken into account in future policymaking aimed at scientifically reducing O3 pollution in NW. 
 Previous studies have shown that surface air temperature (SAT) facilitates the formation of surface ozone (O3), while relative humidity (RH) often inhibits ozone generation. However, the degree to which O3 may respond simultaneously to rising SATs and RH due to climate change remains less understood. We conducted extensive atmospheric chemistry model scenario simulations to investigate the impacts of long-term trends of humidification and warming on summer O3 concentrations in Northwestern China (NW) from 1998 to 2017, a period during which this region experienced both warming and the most significant wetting trend in China. We found that the summer mean O3 level in NW increased by 19.9 % during this time. The changes in meteorology led to a reduction in O3 levels, primarily due to humidification in NW, which counteracts the warming-induced O3 increase. We demonstrate that the wetting trend in NW will continue from 2019 to 2030 under a shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) in conjunction with a representative concentration pathway SSP5-RCP8.5, but will either cease or shift to drier conditions from 2019 to 2060 under the SSP2-RCP4.5. No significant responses of O3 fluctuations to RH variations were observed, partly due to manual intervention under the SSP2-RCP4.5."

The ozone filters proved high efficiency in retaining high recovery rates across different environmentally relevant levels of relative humidity and ozone concentrations while safeguarding the sorbent material in both laboratory and field experiments. The filter design has the advantage of not requiring additional equipment or regular checks. 
 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), such as monoterpenes, play essential roles in ecological and atmospheric processes, influencing air quality, climate, and interspecies interactions. For accurate identification and quantification of these reactive compounds in the environment, active sampling on sorbent tubes followed by thermal desorption–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry is commonly used. However, ozone present in the sampled air can degrade both the analytes and the sorbent material during the sampling process, leading to underestimation of target substances and overestimation of their degradation products. This study evaluates a novel reusable ozone filter designed for direct attachment to sorbent tubes and compatibility with multi-tube samplers. The filter utilizes potassium iodide (KI) or sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) deposited on reusable glass filters and copper wool to improve the accuracy of BVOC measurements. Both types of ozone scrubbers were tested under varying ozone concentrations up to 50 ppb and relative humidity levels up to 90 %, utilizing a straightforward load-and-flush method as well as a permeation approach that simulates field sampling conditions. Furthermore, both methods were compared regarding their suitability for the systematic evaluation of ozone filters.Results indicate that both KI and Na2S2O3 effectively remove ozone, with KI showing a slightly higher performance and lower dependence on relative humidity, maintaining over 90 % removal efficiency even after 10 d of ambient air exposure. Recovery rates for four structurally different monoterpenes (α-pinene, myrcene, limonene, linalool) showed no significant differences between filtered and unfiltered samples at baseline ozone concentrations, demonstrating that the ozone filters did not negatively impact analyte recovery. When no filter was used, recovery rates for myrcene, limonene, and linalool declined with increasing ozone concentration while showing a method-dependent positive influence of increasing relative humidity. Both scrubber materials maintained high and comparable recovery rates across all tested conditions, except at very low relative humidity, thereby enhancing measurement accuracy and comparability under diverse environmental scenarios. Field tests confirmed the effectiveness of KI-loaded scrubbers in enhancing monoterpene detection in forest air while safeguarding the sorbent material. These results, combined with the easy reusability of the glass filters and the absence of additional equipment or power requirements, highlight that this scrubber design proves to be an optimal choice for the long-term environmental monitoring of volatile organic compounds."

A novel mass concentration (mascon) dataset, GCL-Mascon2024, was determined by leveraging the short-arc approach, advanced spatial constraints, a frequency-dependent noise processing strategy, and parameterization-integrating natural boundaries, aiming to enhance accuracy for monitoring mass transportation on Earth. 
 This paper reports on an innovative mass concentration (mascon) solution obtained with the short-arc approach, named “GCL-Mascon2024”, for estimating spatially enhanced mass variations on the Earth's surface by analyzing K- and Ka-band ranging satellite-to-satellite tracking data collected by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. Compared to contemporary GRACE mascon solutions, this contribution has three notable and distinct features: first, this solution recovery process incorporates frequency-dependent data-weighting techniques to reduce the influence of low-frequency noise in observations. Second, this solution uses variably shaped mascon geometry with physical constraints such as coastline and basin boundary geometries to more accurately capture temporal gravity signals while minimizing signal leakage. Finally, we employ a solution regularization scheme that integrates climate factors and cryospheric elevation models to alleviate the ill-posed nature of the GRACE mascon inversion problem. Our research has led to the following conclusions: (a) GCL-Mascon2024 mass anomaly estimates from GRACE data show strong agreement with the (Release) RL06 versions of mascon solutions (GSFC, CSR, JPL) in both spatial and temporal domains; (b) in Greenland and global hydrologic basins, the correlation coefficients of estimated mass changes between GCL-Mascon2024 and other RL06 mascon solutions exceed 95.0 %, with comparable amplitudes, and, especially over non-humid river basins, the GCL-Mascon2024 suppresses random noise by 27.8 % compared to contemporary mascon products; and (c) in desert regions, the analysis of residuals calculated after removing the climatological components from the mass variations indicates that the GCL-Mascon2024 solution achieves noise reductions of over 29.3 % as compared to the GSFC and CSR RL06 mascon solutions.

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the instrumentation, data processing and the resulting data archive, enabling its further use in data analysis, model development and validation of satellite data retrievals. 
 We describe a 25 years (1996–2021) observational dataset of meteorology, turbulent fluxes and net ecosystem exchange collected from the first tower at the Loobos site, the Netherlands (NL). This is one of the 17 first FLUXNET sites globally. The presented dataset contains six data streams, namely (1) the NL-Loo_BM stream including meteorological data: four-component radiation (radiation balance), air temperature and relative humidity, wind information, precipitation and throughfall, photosynthetic active radiation, bole temperature and soil heat flux), (2) the NL-Loo_Profile stream containing vertical profiles of CO2 mole fraction, H2O pressure, air temperature and relative humidity, (3) the NL-Loo_ST stream derived from the aforementioned two streams including total stored heat flux, H2O and CO2 fluxes below the canopy, (4) the NL-Loo_EC stream including EC measurements of CO2 flux, sensible heat and latent heat fluxes, (5) the NL-Loo_Soil stream including vertical profiles of soil moisture and temperature and ground water level data, and (6) ancillary data including soil respiration, vegetation properties (i.e., tree height, stem width and dry aboveground biomass, Leaf Area Index, sap flow, needle foliage properties and the associated nutrient analysis) and ground water level. The data quality of these data streams is assured through standard operating procedures. To show the utility of gathering long-term and comprehensive measurements, we present analyses of mean diurnal storage CO2 flux, the trend of NEE over the last 25 years and the energy balance closure. Being one of the longest datasets of its kind in a temperate forest, this valuable dataset is anticipated to be used for investigating the performance of various gap-filling algorithms, semi-climatological trends including extreme climatic events (such as the heatwave of 2003 and the drought of 2018) and the role of forest ecosystem in the carbon, water and energy cycle. Meanwhile, it is expected to be employed for validating modelled land-atmosphere CO2 and turbulent exchange fluxes, verifying model assumptions and serving as ground truth for satellite data retrievals.

Raymond,A spatially explicit dataset of agriculture liming across the contiguous United States,"We created the first detailed map of how much agricultural lime has been used across the United States from 1930 to 1987. Lime helps improve soil health and crop growth. Our study shows that how and where lime is used depends on climate, soil, and farming practices. By using machine learning, we found patterns that help explain these differences. This work helps us better understand the environmental role of lime and its impact on farming and climate. 
 Agricultural lime has historically been applied to croplands in the United States to counteract soil acidification and enhance soil fertility, with important consequences for crop productivity and Earth’s carbon cycle. Previous work on agricultural liming has largely focused on either region-specific case studies or national-level estimates of total application rates, leaving a major gap in understanding the spatial variability in lime application. This study addresses this gap by presenting the first spatially explicit dataset of agricultural lime application across the contiguous United States. The dataset comprises state-level data for 1930–1950 and a more detailed county-level dataset for 1954–1987, enabling comprehensive spatial-temporal analyses at multiple scales. Counties in the Midwest region exhibited the highest total amounts of lime applied in the latter half of the twentieth century, reflecting intensive agricultural activity. These counties were characterized by higher overall lime application rates (amount of lime applied per unit of limed area each year) but relatively lower liming frequency (ratio of limed area to total agricultural land area each year). In contrast, counties in the southeastern coastal region exhibited lower lime application rates per unit of limed area but more frequent lime applications. We used a machine learning framework, to elucidate key environmental and agricultural drivers of lime application. Our results show that the total amount of lime applied, as well as the application rate and frequency, are strongly associated with regional climatic conditions and soil properties. However, we also found evidence that agricultural management practices (such as crop production, fertilizer use, and soil pH recommendations) played a key role in shaping liming applications. Spatiotemporal integration of the data product results in a revised national estimate of total lime application, with a range of 15–25 million tons (Mt) per year. This study establishes a critical observational baseline for assessing the potential of agricultural lime application as a climate mitigation strategy and highlights the need for further research into its long-term environmental impacts."

The outcome is an open-access, century-scale global SPM dataset designed to advance research on long-term SPM source-sink dynamics and their climate connections. 
 Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) is a crucial indicator of marine nutrient transport, the carbon cycle, and land-sourced pollution. However, SPM research has been constrained by limited data. While marine remote sensing has helped fill this gap since late 20th century, pre-2000 data remains scarce, particularly for global datasets with high spatiotemporal resolution. To address the shortage of in-situ SPM observations, we developed two empirical models for estimating SPM concentrations: one based on remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and the other on Secchi depth (Zsd). Model evaluation shows that retrieval uncertainties do not exceed 35 %. To mitigate errors in highly turbid waters (>100 mg l-1), we applied data quality constraints by excluding samples above this threshold. The resulting dataset merges in-situ SPM observations, providing global coverage of SPM concentrations from 1890 to 2020. Temporal and spatial analysis reveals an overall increase in global SPM concentrations, with a sharp rise between 1920 and 1942, followed by a rapid return to pre-1920 levels. The underlying causes of this fluctuation warrant further investigation. This unique dataset holds considerable potential for marine resource management, climate modeling, human activity assessment, and environmental protection."

The resulting dataset can serve as valuable scientific data for policymakers, researchers, and forest managers, guiding appropriate planting, environment enhancement, and carbon sequestration efforts. 
 China has undertaken extensive afforestation efforts in recent decades. However, the effectiveness of these plantings varies with different environmental conditions. Whether China's forest expansion is primarily due to intentional planting or natural reforestation remains uncertain. Thus, assessing the growth of planted forests (PF) is crucial for monitoring forest quality and supporting China’s commitment to carbon neutrality. In this study, using 30 m Landsat time-series, we proposed a Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC)-based PF expansion monitoring (C-PFM) method. Based on the C-PFM, 30 m annual maps for PF and natural forests (NF) across China from 1990 and 2020 were produced. The resulting PF map in 2020 achieved a F1-score of 79.2 % for PF and an overall accuracy of 90.8 % when validated against visually interpreted reference data. The PF maps for the years 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018 were evaluated using data from the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th National Forest Inventory (NFI) data across 34 provinces and autonomous regions of China.

According to the C-PFM results, we found 8.06 million ha (Mha) of net forest gains across China from 1990 to 2020, with 16.15 Mha net gains of PF and 8.09 Mha net loss of NF. In eight forestry ecological engineering areas, we observed that the upper and middle reaches of Yangtze river Shelterbelt Program and Pearl River Shelterbelt Program experienced the most significant PF expansion. The resulting dataset can serve as valuable scientific data for policymakers, researchers, and forest managers, guiding appropriate planting, environment enhancement, and carbon sequestration efforts.

We compiled 51 cruises and used a machine learning method trained on 37 cruises that passed secondary quality control to reconstruct isotope values in the Atlantic. The reconstruction expands usable samples from 8,941 to 68,435, reducing noise, filling gaps, preserving decadal trend, and strengthening studies of carbon variability and model validation. 
 Stable carbon isotope composition of marine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), δ13CDIC, is a valuable tracer for oceanic carbon cycling. However, its observational coverage remains much sparser than that of DIC and other physical or biogeochemical variables, limiting its full potential. Here, we reconstruct δ13CDIC in the Atlantic Ocean using a probabilistic machine learning framework, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). We compiled data from 51 historical cruises, including a high-resolution 2023 A16N section, and applied secondary quality control via crossover analysis, retaining 37 cruises for model training, validation, and testing. The trained GPR model achieved an average bias of −0.007 ± 0.082 ‰ and an overall uncertainty of 0.11 ‰, arising from measurement (0.07 ‰), mapping (0.08 ‰), and negligible input-variable (3.77 × 10−14 ‰) errors. Using the GLODAPv2.2023 Atlantic dataset as predictors, the reconstruction expanded the number of acceptable δ13CDIC samples by a factor of 7.65, from 8,941 to 68,435 across the Atlantic basins. The resulting dataset markedly improves the spatial resolution in longitude, latitude, and depth, and provides enhanced temporal continuity over the past four decades. Compared to the sparse original measurements, the reconstruction reduces spatial discontinuities and reveals finer vertical structures consistent with other high-resolution biogeochemical observations. This reconstructed δ13CDIC dataset provides new opportunities to resolve regional carbon cycle dynamics, validate Earth system models, refine estimates of oceanic carbon uptake, and extend climate reanalysis records.

We find that the biases are reduced with higher horizontal resolution but not with a shorter time step. The large-scale precipitation is sensitive to the horizontal resolution and time step; however, the convective precipitation is sensitive to the model time step. Higher horizontal resolution is more important for extreme precipitation simulation than a shorter time step. 
 Events of extreme precipitation pose a hazard to many parts of Europe but are typically not well represented in climate models. Here, we evaluate daily extreme precipitation over Europe during 1982–2019 in observations (GPCC), reanalysis (ERA5), and a set of atmosphere-only simulations at low (100 km), medium (50 km), and high (25 km) horizontal resolution and also at different time steps (i.e., 60, 30, and 15 min) using low resolution (100 km) with identical vertical resolutions using OpenIFS (version 43r3). We find that both OpenIFS simulations and reanalysis underestimate the rates of extreme precipitation compared to observations. The biases are largest for the lowest resolution (100 km) and decrease with higher-horizontal-resolution (50 and 25 km) simulations in all seasons. The sensitivity to horizontal resolution is particularly high in mountain regions (such as the Alps, Scandinavia, Iberian Peninsula), likely linked to the sensitivity of vertical velocity to the representation of topography. The sensitivity of precipitation to model resolution increases dramatically with increasing percentiles, with modest biases in the 70th–80th percentile range and large biases above the 99th percentile range. We also find that precipitation above the 99th percentile mostly consists of large-scale precipitation (∼ 80 %) in winter, while in summer it is mostly large-scale precipitation in northern Europe (∼ 70 %) and convective precipitation in southern Europe (∼ 70 %). Convective precipitation is more sensitive to model time step than to horizontal resolution. Large-scale precipitation increases significantly with both higher horizontal resolution and a shorter model time step."

By synchronizing the models, particularly in storm track regions, we achieve better predictions without losing variability. This approach maintains key climate patterns and reduces bias in some variables compared to traditional models, demonstrating a useful technique for improving atmospheric simulations. 
 Here we present a research framework for the first atmosphere-connected supermodel using state-of-the-art atmospheric models. The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) versions 5 and 6 exchange information interactively while running, a process known as supermodeling. The primary goal of this approach is to synchronize the models, allowing them to create a new dynamical system which can theoretically benefit from each component model, in part by increasing the dimensionality of the system.In this study, we examine a single untrained supermodel where each model version is equally weighted in creating pseudo-observations. We demonstrate that the models synchronize well without decreased variability, particularly in storm track regions, across multiple timescales, and for variables where no information has been exchanged. Synchronization is less pronounced in the tropics, and in regions of lesser synchronization we observe a decrease in high-frequency variability. Additionally, the low-frequency modes of variability (North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific North American Pattern) are not degraded compared to the base models. For some variables, the mean bias, as well as the non-interactive ensemble mean, is reduced compared to control simulations of each model version."

We designed several experiments to achieve our goals of this activity: (1) to evaluate the climate model performance and (2) to understand the Earth system responses to this eruption. 
 The 2022 Hunga volcanic eruption injected a significant amount of water vapor and a moderate amount of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, causing observable responses in the climate system. We have developed a model–observation comparison project to investigate the evolution of volcanic water and aerosols and their impacts on atmospheric dynamics, chemistry, and climate, using several state-of-the-art chemistry climate models. The project goals are (1) to evaluate the current chemistry–climate models to quantify their performance in comparison to observations and (2) to understand atmospheric responses in the Earth system after this exceptional event and investigate the potential impacts in the projected future. To achieve these goals, we designed specific experiments for direct comparisons to observations, for example from balloons and the Microwave Limb Sounder satellite instrument. Experiment 1 consists of two sets of free-running ensemble experiments from 2022 to 2031: one with fixed sea-surface temperatures and sea ice and one with coupled ocean. These experiments will help to understand the long-term evolution of water vapor and aerosols; quantify HTHH effects on stratospheric and mesospheric temperatures, dynamics, and transport; understand the impact of dynamic changes on ozone chemistry; quantify the net radiative forcings; and evaluate any surface climate impact. Experiment 2 is a nudged-run experiment from 2022 to 2023 using observed meteorology. To allow participation of more climate models with varying complexities of aerosol simulation, we include two sets of simulations in Experiment 2: Experiment 2a is designed for models with internally generated aerosol, while Experiment 2b is designed for models using prescribed aerosol surface area density. This experiment will help to analyze H2O and aerosol evolution, quantify the net radiative forcings, understand the impacts on mid-latitude and polar O3 chemistry, and allow close comparisons with observations."

 It is essential to improve our understanding of glaciers and their effects on sea levels, ecosystems, and freshwater resources in a changing climate. To this end, we implemented a framework for three-dimensional, high-resolution, regional-scale glacier simulations in the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM v2.2), using higher-order ice-flow dynamics previously applied to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Here, we present the modeling framework and its application to the European Alps glaciers at a 100 m resolution, using protocols from the third phase of the Glacier Model Intercomparison Project (GlacierMIP3). The model results align with observations and other glacier models, indicating that Alpine glaciers will lose more than half their current mass if present-day climate conditions persist, with near-total loss under warmer scenarios. This new development integrates glacier and ice sheet systems in a common modeling framework and will support advances in coupled land ice–Earth system assessments across timescales in the Community Earth System Model (CESM)."

Although these catalysts are recognized as crucial agents for the formation of PBDD/Fs, there is still significant knowledge gaps in identifying the active species and quantifying their catalytic activities. This study systematically investigates four key reaction pathways governing PBDD/Fs formation: aromatic bromination, the Deacon reaction, the precursor, and the de novo synthesis process. Through comprehensive analysis of typical bromides and oxides in the municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) flue gas, we found pronounced catalytic effects of iron, copper, manganese, and antimony species. Notably, their oxides exhibit excellent catalytic properties across all key pathways, with efficacy in facilitating the Deacon reaction, the precursor, and the de novo synthesis process. Comparative analyses with existing studies indicate that particles of Fe, Cu, Mn, and Sb exhibit different catalytic properties in the formation process of PBDD/Fs and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), which fundamentally distinguish their respective formation mechanisms. Importantly, our results systematically elucidate the specific catalytic functions of metal/metalloid species for the formation of PBDD/Fs."

Jin,Generation of More Potent Components at Higher Temperatures Offsets Toxicity Reduction despite Reduced Mass Emissions during Biomass Burning,"Biomass burning organic aerosols (BBOAs) represent a major global health hazard. Their toxicity varies significantly due to the diversity of combustion conditions, which shape mixtures of components with differing toxic potency. We quantified component-specific contributions to intracellular reactive oxygen species generation in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to BBOAs produced under controlled combustion conditions. Elevated combustion temperatures substantially reduced organic carbon (OC) mass emissions (by 20-fold) but resulted in a more modest reduction in OC toxicity emissions (by 5-fold). The toxicity emission reduction was primarily attributed to water-extractable OC (WOC), while methanol-extractable OC (MOC) limited this effect. The reduced emission of WOC toxicity was driven by the decreased mass emission of polar compounds such as methoxylates, as the toxicity per unit mass of WOC showed negligible changes across temperatures. In contrast, the toxicity per unit mass of MOC increased 10-fold from low to high temperatures, partially due to the formation of more potent aromatic derivatives, despite their smaller mass contribution. These findings underscore the importance of identifying key toxicity drivers to guide targeted source apportionment and refine strategies for reducing toxic emissions."

However, many SAF feedstocks and biorefining technologies are still in the research and development stages, which complicates accurate predictions of their long-term environmental impacts through traditional life cycle assessments (LCAs). Prospective LCA (pLCA) methods, which use dynamic life cycle inventory models, offer a solution to static LCA by evaluating impacts within a future context. This study leverages pLCA to assess the decarbonization potential of three SAF pathways using corn, miscanthus, and algae biomass across three future scenarios. The miscanthus pathway consistently demonstrates the lowest carbon intensity, starting at approximately 14 g CO2e MJ–1 and maintaining this low level across all scenarios by 2050. This stability is attributed to its simpler and more mature conversion technology. In contrast, the algal and corn pathways, which initially present higher emissions (98.1 g CO2e MJ–1 and 71.8 g CO2e MJ–1 respectively), show significant reductions by 2050. Specifically, algal and corn-based SAF drop to 33.1 g CO2e MJ–1 and 49 g CO2e MJ–1, respectively, particularly under aggressive climate policy scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of pLCA for evaluating emerging technologies, as results are shown to significantly change from 2020 to 2050."

The average nitryl chloride (ClNO2) and molecular chlorine (Cl2) were 110 ± 193 and 13 ± 13 ppt during the day, and 186 ± 216 and 12 ± 17 ppt at night, respectively. In addition, we performed vertical profile experiments to determine the air-snow surface exchange fluxes of ClNO2 and Cl2. They generally exhibited net deposition to the snowpack at night but frequently showed net emissions from the snowpack during the day, suggesting photochemical production on the snowpack. On average, photolysis of Cl2 produced three times more chlorine radicals than ClNO2 on a daily basis.

In this study, we spiked raw wastewater samples with eight human respiratory viruses and processed them with four methods that concentrate and/or extract nucleic acids from both liquid and solid fractions (Promega, Nanotrap, and InnovaPrep) or only the solid fraction of wastewater (Solids). Our findings provide encouraging evidence that all four methods combined with dPCR could detect an emerging virus in wastewater, although they differed in sensitivity. The pattern of recovery efficiency for adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza A viruses was consistent across methods, with Promega producing higher median recovery efficiencies, while distinct patterns were observed for coxsackieviruses. We also normalized the concentration data with two endogenous fecal indicators, PMMoV and Carjivirus (formerly crAssphage). We found that normalization could reduce method-associated differences if the indicator exhibited a recovery pattern similar to that of the target virus.

Results showed that antihyperglycemics and antibiotics dominated concentration profiles, while hormones and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) posed the most severe ecological risks. 76 PPCPs exhibited potential risks in at least one country, with ibuprofen, 17β-estradiol, and carbamazepine identified as critical compounds, and estrone posing high risks to aquatic ecosystems globally. Across income levels, PPCP concentrations peaked in lower-middle-income countries, while ecological risks were highest in upper-middle-income regions. PPCP risks were correlated with multiple factors such as environmental infrastructure, healthcare systems, unemployment rates, and the Gini index. In addition, hydrological dilution and PPCP usage were also important driving factors that might be affected by climate change. Here, we offer the perspective that enhancing treatment capacity, improving healthcare accessibility, mitigating socioeconomic disparities, and adapting to climate change are imperative to mitigate PPCP risks while advancing across many of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals."

However, the effectiveness of those actions on reducing environmental inequality is not clear. Here, we analyzed the air pollution disparity changes in China from 2013 to 2018 using a combination of air quality, population and urbanization data. For PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and CO, we found a general decline in both rural-urban disparity and geographic disparity, with SO2 and CO showing the most substantial reductions. For O3, we found mixed changes in rural-urban disparity and an increase in geographic disparity. Our findings suggest that China’s air pollution control strategies have been effective in improving overall air quality and reducing exposure inequalities. We underscore the importance of strategies to reduce NO2 emissions, given its significant rural-urban and geographic disparities, and its role as a precursor to both PM2.5 and O3.

This study demonstrates that developmental exposure to mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP: 0, 10, and 50 mg/kg), the bioactive metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), induced neurobehavioral deficits in adolescent offspring rats. Behavioral assessments revealed that the MEHP exposure provoked anxiety-like behaviors at postnatal days (PND) 14 and 21, concurrently manifested as spatial memory impairments at PND35. Histopathological analysis demonstrated significant neurodegenerative alterations in the hippocampus of MEHP-exposed offspring, including reduced Nissl body density in the 50 mg/kg group. Transcriptomic profiling identified a robust dose-dependent dysregulation pattern, with high-dose exposure (50 mg/kg) eliciting substantially more differentially expressed genes (542 DEGs) than low-dose exposure (393 DEGs). Analysis revealed suppression of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways, characterized by the downregulation of Cyp2a1, Cyp2f4, Cyp2g1, and Cyp1a2. Strikingly, these effects occurred independently of canonical xenobiotic-sensing receptors, indicating direct CYP450 transcriptional inhibition as a potential novel mechanism. Taken together, our findings determine MEHP as a potent developmental neurotoxicant, with CYP450 dysregulation identified as a critical mediator of phthalate-induced neurotoxicity, with significant implications for environmental risk assessment."

However, changes in the stratospheric impacts of the MJO, in particular on sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events, remain to be elucidated. This study investigates the decadal variation in the MJO‐SSW relationship, which suggests that, in the epoch of 1980–1999 (E1), there is an absence of systematic MJO activity preceding SSWs for all MJO phases. Conversely, during 2000–2020 (E2), a robust phase‐locked relationship between MJO phase 7 (P7) and the subsequent SSWs is observed. Concurrently, E2 has seen an amplified vertical planetary wave pulse following P7, resulting in a maximum warming of the Arctic stratosphere exceeding 5°C. The results suggest a pronounced intensification of the MJO‐SSW relationship in the past two decades, probably due to the prolonged duration of MJO‐related enhanced convection during P7 and the shifts in the extratropical basic state."

After the IMF is southward, the inflow of the electromagnetic energy (the Poynting flux) increases, leading to a loading of magnetic energy. Subsequently, a strong energy conversion occurs from the magnetic field to the plasma, leading to an unloading of the magnetic energy. When the IMF is radial, strong disturbances are formed on the magnetopause, but the total ion flux, energy fluxes, and energy conversion are not pronounced. The corresponding ion enthalpy flux and bulk kinetic energy flux are also examined. These analyses allow precise and quantitative evaluations of various space weather effects."

The tail of the probability distribution of heatwave‐preconditioned rainfall intensity decays slower than uncompounded events. Using a state‐of‐the‐art hydrodynamic model and joint exceedance probability of accumulated event rainfall and peak rainfall intensity, we find that the spatial extent of high‐hazard zones (1.4–3.5 m inundation depth) is up to ∼6 times larger compared to uncompounded events, while building and population exposure increase by 7 and 11 times, respectively.

The pre‐Ediacaran geological timescale is currently subdivided by approximate absolute ages. Here we identified a unique four‐layer tuff sequence within the Xiamaling Formation black shales, North China Craton, that can be traced over a large area ∼400 km long by ∼100 km wide, and represents a synchronous marker horizon formed by air fall tuffs from distant volcanic eruptions. High‐precision U‐Pb geochronology shows that the tuff sequence span a short duration of 0.21 Myr at 1380.41 ± 0.99 Ma. The tuff layers match the age of widely distributed ∼1,380 Ma LIPs found on multiple cratons in supercontinent Columbia/Nuna.

 Both diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and transcriptomic technologies have provided unprecedented opportunities to dissect brain network communication, offering insights from structural connectivity and signaling molecules separately. However, incorporating these complementary modalities for characterizing the interregional communication remains challenging. By simplifying the communication processes into an optimal transport problem, which is defined as the ligand-receptor expression coupling constrained by structurally-derived communication cost, we develop a method called CLRIA (connectome-constrained ligand-receptor interaction analysis) to infer a low-rank representation of ligand-receptor interaction-mediated communication networks. To solve the proposed optimization problem, the block majorization minimization algorithm is adopted and proven to converge globally. We benchmark CLRIA on simulated and published data, validating its accuracy and computational efficiency. Subsequently, we demonstrate the CLRIA’s utility in evaluating communication strategies and asymmetric communication using its solution. Furthermore, CLRIA-derived communication patterns successfully decode brain state transitions. Overall, our results highlight CLRIA as a valuable tool for understanding complex communication in the brain.

In this study, the authors uncover the structural basis by which HIV-1 adapts to a deficiency in IP6 packaging through a G225R mutation at the C-terminus of the capsid protein. 
 Inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) promotes HIV-1 assembly by stabilizing the immature Gag lattice and becomes enriched within virions, where it is required for mature capsid assembly. Previously, we identified Gag mutants that package little IP6 yet assemble particles, though they are non-infectious due to defective capsid formation. Here, we report a compensatory mutation, G225R, in the C-terminus of capsid protein (CA) that restores capsid assembly and infectivity in these IP6-deficient mutants. G225R also enhances in vitro assembly of CA into capsid-like particles at far lower IP6 concentrations than required for wild-type CA. CryoEM structures of G225R CA hexamers and lattices at 2.7 Å resolution reveal that the otherwise disordered C-terminus becomes structured, stabilizing hexamer-hexamer interfaces. Molecular dynamics simulations support this mechanism. These findings uncover how HIV-1 can adapt to IP6 deficiency and highlight a previously unrecognized structural role of the CA C-terminus, while offering tools for capsid-related studies.

The use of Si- and Ge-containing directing groups has been demonstrated to effectively suppress undesirable metathesis reactions, a side effect typically associated with their metallic nature. Our approach employs an iridium catalyst in combination with a ligand and an acetate base, which facilitates the formation of benzo-fused four-membered metallacycles within the catalytic cycle.

Here, the authors utilise longitudinal sampling of a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma model to identify biomarkers of response. 
 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has improved outcomes for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but predictive biomarkers remain limited. Here, we use a time-resolved, multi-omic approach in a murine HNSCC model to characterize peripheral immune responses to ICB. Single-cell transcriptomics and T/B cell receptor analyses  reveal early on-treatment expansion of effector memory T and B cell repertoires in responders, preceding tumor regression. These dynamic immune features inform a composite transcriptional signature that accurately predicts ICB response in independent human HNSCC cohorts. LiBIO outperforms existing biomarkers and generalizes to melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer without retraining. These findings suggest that early treatment-induced changes in circulating immune repertoires reflect the host’s capacity to mount an effective antitumor response. This work provides a framework for leveraging transient peripheral immune dynamics to develop non-invasive, high-fidelity biomarkers for response to immunotherapy across cancer types.

Jang et al. report structural and mechanistic studies of CRAF/MEK1/14-3-3 complexes that explain distinct features of CRAF regulation. 
 CRAF (RAF1) is one of three RAF-family kinases that initiate MAP kinase signaling in response to activated RAS and is essential for oncogenic signaling from mutant KRAS. Like BRAF, CRAF is regulated by 14-3-3 engagement and by intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions of its N-terminal regulatory region. Unlike BRAF, it is thought to require tyrosine phosphorylation in its N-terminal acidic (NtA) motif for full catalytic activation. Here we describe cryo-EM reconstructions of full-length CRAF in complex with MEK1 and a 14-3-3 dimer. These structures reveal a fully autoinhibited conformation analogous to that observed for BRAF and two “open monomer” states in which the inhibitory interactions of the CRD and 14-3-3 dimer are released or rearranged, but the kinase domain remains inactive. Structure-function studies of the NtA motif indicate that phosphorylation or acidic mutations in this segment increase catalytic activity by destabilizing the inactive conformation of the kinase domain. Collectively, these studies provide a structural foundation for understanding the shared and unique regulatory features of CRAF and will inform efforts to selectively block CRAF signaling in cancer.

Their data suggest that MYO7A traffics as a dimer within stereocilia to assemble the mechanoelectrical transduction machinery. 
 Stereocilia are F-actin-based cylindrical protrusions on the apical surface of inner ear hair cells that function as biological mechanosensors of sound and acceleration. During stereocilia development, specific unconventional myosins transport proteins and phospholipids as cargo and mediate elongation, differentiation and acquisition of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET). How unconventional myosins localize themselves and cargo in stereocilia using energy from ATP hydrolysis is only partially understood. Here, we developed STELLA-SPIM microscopy to visualize movement of single myosin molecules in live hair cell stereocilia. STELLA-SPIM demonstrated that MYO7A, a component of MET machinery, shows processive movement toward stereocilia tips when chemically dimerized or constitutively activated by missense mutations disabling tail-mediated autoinhibition. Conversely, MYO7A shows step-wise but not processive movement in stereocilia when its tail is tethered to the plasma membrane or F-actin in the presence of MYO7A interacting partners. We posit that MYO7A dimerizes and moves processively in stereocilia when unleashed from autoinhibition.

 Reactive nitrogen plays critical roles in atmospheric chemistry, climate, and geochemical cycles, yet its sources in the marine atmosphere, particularly the cause of the puzzling daytime peaks of nitrous acid (HONO), remain unexplained. Here we reveal that iodide enhances HONO production during aqueous nitrate photolysis by over tenfold under typical marine conditions. Laboratory experiments and molecular simulations confirm that HONO formation from nitrate photolysis is a surface-dependent process, and the extreme surface propensity of iodide facilitates nitrate enrichment at interfaces, reducing the solvent cage effect and promoting HONO release. Global model simulations show that this process accelerates atmospheric nitrogen cycling, increasing the levels of nitrogen oxides, hydroxyl radicals, and ozone by over 25%, 30%, and 15%, respectively, and enhancing dimethyl sulfide and methane degradation by over 20% in the marine boundary layers.

Here, single cell profiling of metastatic melanoma samples identifies associations of the mature dendritic enriched in immunoregulatory molecules subtype with immunotherapy response. 
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, yet most patients fail to achieve durable responses. To better understand the tumor microenvironment (TME), we analyze single-cell RNA-seq (~189 K cells) from 36 metastatic melanoma samples, defining 14 cell types, 55 subtypes, and 15 transcriptional hallmarks of malignant cells. Correlations between cell subtype proportions reveal six distinct clusters, with a mature dendritic cell subtype enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDC) linked to naive T and B cells. Importantly, mregDC abundance predicts progression-free survival (PFS) with ICIs and other therapies, especially when combined with the TCF7 + /– CD8 T cell ratio. Analysis of an independent cohort (n = 318) validates mregDC as a predictive biomarker for anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapies. Further characterization of mregDCs versus conventional dendritic cells (cDC1/cDC2) highlights their unique transcriptional, epigenetic (single-nucleus ATAC-seq data for cDCs from 14 matched samples), and interaction profiles, offering new insights for improving immunotherapy response and guiding future combination treatments.

 In recent decades, Antarctica has undergone significant climate change, with most studies focusing on the impact of oceanic multiscale variability on Antarctica, especially on West Antarctica. However, our research reveals that Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall strongly influences the austral winter (June–August) Antarctic climate and sea ice concentration (SIC) through atmospheric teleconnections. Diabatic heating from ISM rainfall shifts the Hadley cell northward, triggering a Rossby wave train from the Mascarene Islands into Antarctica. This alters sea level pressure and induces warm advection to both East and West Antarctica, leading to widespread warming. Consequently, Antarctic SIC undergoes a tripole redistribution, with increases in the Ross and Weddell Seas, and decreases in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. These findings emphasize the importance of ISM rainfall in shaping Antarctic climate and SIC, suggesting ISM rainfall as a possible contributing factor to the record-low Antarctic SIC observed during the austral winter of 2023."

Some ensemble members transition to El Niño after 2 years, driven by the development of a positive North Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM) near Hawaii.

 The potential for Arctic sea-ice loss, particularly in the Barents-Kara Seas, to induce Eurasian winter cooling remains contentious. Despite a significant correlation between Barents-Kara-Seas sea-ice loss and Eurasian winter cooling in observations, modeling studies suggest minimal causal influence. Through constraining Barents-Kara-Seas sea-ice to different states in ocean-atmosphere-coupled simulations, here we show that ocean-atmosphere coupling enhances the Eurasian cooling induced by historical sea-ice loss, though still weaker than observed, likely due to internal variability and confounding factors. Historical sea-ice loss induces stronger and deeper Arctic warming with ocean-atmosphere coupling than without, associated with a strengthened Siberian High and East Asian Trough, which promotes Eurasian cooling. However, ocean-atmosphere coupling has little influence on the Eurasian cooling response to projected end-of-the-twenty-first-century sea-ice loss. The Eurasian temperature response to historical sea-ice loss is dominated by dynamically-induced cooling, whereas strong thermodynamical warming masks dynamically-induced cooling in response to far-future sea-ice loss."

 Long-term historical studies of montane tropical forest loss in eastern Africa have been relatively neglected compared to other world regions, despite ramifications for biodiversity, climate crises, and knock-on effects on the African continent. Moreover, there has been a relative lack of historical studies of the legacies of European colonialism on land use change, native population displacement, and resource dispossession in Africa. Using historical maps, archival documents, satellite images and settlement datasets, we map changes in montane forest extent in Kenya from 1910 to 2024. We estimate that during the colonial period (1910–1975) ~ 46% of the montane forest was lost, mainly attributed to large-scale forest concessions and agricultural conversions, and a further ~20% lost during the post-colonial period (1975–2024), attributed to post-colonial resettlement of small-scale farmers in colonially-designated areas and forest excisions. We argue that systematic studies of colonial forest histories are essential to understand contemporary deforestation and socioeconomic issues in eastern Africa and beyond. Logging and agricultural conversions led to the loss of 46% of montane forests in Kenya’s Central Highlands between 1910 and 1975, while legacies of postcolonial resettlement resulted in a further 20% loss between 1975 and 2024, according to historical maps, satellite imagery, and resettlement datasets."

 Climate change is resulting in more extreme fire weather during major heatwaves. Across temperate Europe, shrub landscapes dominate the area burned, with the moisture content of fuels during these events determining the threat posed. Current controls on the moisture content of temperate fuel constituents and their response to future extreme heatwaves are not known. We took field measurements of live and dead heather (Calluna vulgaris) and organic soil moisture content across the UK over 3 years, including an intensive sampling campaign during the July 2022 heatwave. Here, we show that the fuel moisture content of live fuel is associated significantly with phenological variables, dead fuel only with weather variables, whilst organic-rich ground fuels are more associated with landscape variables. However, during the record 2022 heatwave there was a harmonisation in fuel moisture controls across different fuel constituents, with those controls being driven by weather alone. This caused synchronised extreme dryness outside of current seasonal norms across all fuel constituents at the same time and place. Future intense summer heatwaves can therefore be expected to align the most severe conditions for fire ignition, spread and impact in traditionally non-fire prone regions, producing humid temperate landscapes susceptible to extreme wildfire events.

 This paper studies the problem of the energy transfer from a subaerial landslide to the waves it produces, in two dimensions, with a thoroughly validated multiphase Navier-Stokes model. The completeness of the model and the large domain considered give access to the time evolution of the slide and water energy components up to the far field. Considering a configuration favoring high energy transfer efficiency, namely a triangular water slide lying at the free surface, the slide volume (per unit width) is varied. The results show that the transfer efficiency is reduced by dispersion for the smaller slides and by breaking for the larger ones, leading to the existence of a local optimum for an intermediate slide size. Starting from this point, a new optimum is obtained by varying the slide density and the slope angle. Hence, with a density of 1750 kg. m−3 and a slope of 30°, the efficiency reaches a value of 87% in the near field and 73% in the far field, which may be good approximates of the related maxima in two dimensions. Compared to the previous optimum case, considering a granular rheology or slides at higher elevations drastically decreases the efficiency. The energy transfer rate from a two-dimensional subaerial landslide to the tsunami produced may be limited to a value of about 70 % in the far field, according to Navier-Stokes simulations."

 Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity, raising urgent questions about how citizens engage with such crises, especially in authoritarian and developing countries. We analyze citizen engagement on China’s Local Leaders’ Message Board, a government-run petition platform, to examine how residents communicate demands for public safety and infrastructure.

These demands, although not framed in climate-specific language, reflect calls for state-led adaptation that is concrete and localized. We also find that concern about the disaster and preparedness extended beyond Henan, prompting appeals in unaffected provinces.

 Ocean ecological time series grow more useful with longevity, but practical constraints hinder consistency, and evolving scientific priorities necessitate sampling adjustments. We leveraged 30 years of zooplankton observations (five species, 1993–2024) from the western Antarctic Peninsula to quantify how shifts in sampling intensity, timing, and survey frequency influenced accuracy, precision, and predictability. A 67% decline in sample size aliased a long-term trend in ice krill and increased uncertainty by 47% in log10 space across species. Moving survey dates by two weeks influenced the density of salps, pteropods, and Antarctic krill by 48–83%. The ability to predict krill species density declined 47% in a simulated shift from annual to biennial survey frequency. Reduced spatial resolution and slight changes in timing can be accounted for statistically, but temporal gaps represent a challenge.

 Sustainability requirements imposed on agricultural producers by downstream supply chain actors risk excluding smallholder farmers from upgraded markets. Here we investigated smallholder participation in sustainably certified palm oil mill markets in Indonesia. We developed and applied a conceptual model to estimate the importance of structural market access, smallholder capacity, and buyer/seller behavior in shaping mill smallholder sourcing. Smallholders who hold exclusive contracts with specific mills were overrepresented at certified mills. Independent smallholders unaffiliated with mills contributed one-third of regional oil palm production but 7% of certified mill supply. We found no evidence that independent smallholders exited markets after mill certification (“active” exclusion). Instead, only 36% of certified mills ever purchased from independent smallholders, and independent smallholder lands were less common around certified (29–38% of palm area) versus noncertified (41–42%) mills. To address such “passive” exclusion, supply chain governance programs should encourage participation of actors well-positioned to source from small-scale producers.

 Temperature impacts on microbiological processes are crucial for soil biogeochemistry and ecosystem functioning, yet existing models either fail to capture microbial temperature dependences across the full biokinetic range or risk overparameterization. Here we present the “Dual-Kinetics Ratkowsky” model (Ratkowsky DK), which simultaneously describes temperature dependences of microbial growth and respiration. Compared to established models (Arrhenius, Ratkowsky, MMRT, and MMRT-2S), Ratkowsky DK showed superior performance and parsimony when applied to soils along a climate gradient, with strong implications for estimating soil carbon stock changes. Although empirically derived, the model provides reliable estimates of microbial thermal traits and climate responsiveness, reflecting warm- and cold-shifted adaptations. It also offers a biological interpretation whereby temperature-driven cell death fuels respiration beyond a threshold, explaining the decoupling between anabolism and catabolism. Ratkowsky DK represents a promising tool for advancing our understanding of microbial and biogeochemical responses to climate and implementation of ecology into Earth system representations.

 Aquatic vegetation (AV) is crucial for maintaining lake ecosystem's stability. Transformation of certain types of AV (e.g., submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV)) into other lake features (e.g., algal bloom) may cause a shift in lake's stable state. However, such transformations in Chinese lakes remain largely unknown. Using 0.23 million Landsat images from 1988 to 2023, a comprehensive investigation was conducted to reveal the long-term conversions between SAV, floating and emergent AV (FEAV), and non-AV (e.g., water or algal bloom) across 4375 Chinese lakes (with area > 1 km2). Results show that from 1988–1993 to 2018–2023, the total lake AV area experienced a reduction of 0.7 × 103 km2. Despite a countrywide net increase in FEAV (+0.9 × 103 km2), it could not offset the sharp decline in SAV (−1.6 × 103 km2). The SAV decline was mainly observed in Eastern Plain lake region. Nationwide, 3.6 × 103 km2 of SAV have transitioned into non-AV, with 78.3% of this area transformation occurring in Eastern Plain. In contrast, many non-AV areas on the Tibetan Plateau saw an emergence of SAV, expanding at +17.9 km2 per year. However, mutual conversions between SAV and FEAV were minimal. National FEAV gains were primarily from non-AV conversions (+1.3 × 103 km2), occurring mainly in Eastern Plain, while SAV-to-FEAV transitions accounted for only 23.8% of total FEAV gains. Driving forces analysis shows that lake eutrophication dominated SAV reduction, whereas FEAV variations were primarily influenced by eutrophication, temperature, and lake water area changes. These findings could provide important insights for lake restoration management in China."

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is an effective probe for photosynthesis, but this remote sensing signal is affected by multiple factors, including radiation intensity, canopy structure, sun-observer geometry, and leaf physiological status. The complex interplay among these factors causes substantial discrepancies among top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF, leaf-level average SIF and actual photosynthetic activity. Downscaling TOC SIF to the leaf-level and decoupling structural and physiological information remain major challenges in the use of SIF signals for remote sensing of photosynthesis. To address these challenges, the R2F (reflectance-to-fluorescence) theory was developed, grounded in the similarity in radiative transfer processes governing SIF and reflectance. This theory establishes a physical relationship between near-infrared reflectance (Rnir) and the far-red SIF scattering coefficient (σF). On this basis, SIF signals can be scaled from the canopy to the leaf level by normalizing σF, estimated from reflectance as σF=Rnir/i0, where i0 denotes canopy interceptance. However, the original R2F formulation assumes a non-reflective soil. This simplification breaks down in sparse canopies, where soil contributions are non-negligible—an issue referred to as the “black-soil problem”. Soil enhances both Rnir and σF, distorting their intrinsic relationship. In this study, we show that soil effects manifest through two main mechanisms: (1) direct soil reflection, which significantly increases Rnir but has minimal impact on σF, and (2) soil–vegetation multiple scattering, which affects both Rnir and σF but tends to have compensatory effects. Consequently, the dominant source of bias in the original R2F relationship is direct soil reflection that contributes to Rnir—a mechanism that had not been explicitly isolated in previous studies. This finding allows us to narrow down the “black-soil problem” in the R2F framework to the specific impact of soil single scattering on Rnir. To mitigate this bias, we propose a soil-adjusted R2F (saR2F) method, which estimates the direct soil contribution of Rnir using TOC red and blue reflectance. Correcting Rnir for the direct soil reflection results in a robust relationship between σF and soil-adjusted RnirsaRnir, notably σF=saRnir/i0.We evaluated the saR2F relationship using one field and two simulated datasets. In the field study, saR2F improved the estimation of σF from TOC reflectance, with R2 increasing ranging from 0.21 to 0.31 compared to the original R2F. In the two simulations, saR2F consistently outperformed the original R2F, especially under sparse canopy conditions. We also compared saR2F with NDVI-based (NIRv) and FCVI-based R2F approaches. In the available field observations collected under specific conditions (i.e., varying viewing azimuth angles), the three approaches showed similar performance and were better than the original R2F in explaining the viewing-angle dependence of σF. However, across the broader range of simulated scenarios and for estimating the exact σF, saR2F demonstrated better stability than NIRv and FCVI-based R2F methods. The NIRv-based and FCVI-based R2F methods yielded relatively low RMSE (0.092 and 0.075, respectively) but weak explanatory power, with R2 values below 0.41 for canopies with LAI < 3. In contrast, saR2F achieved a much stronger relationship (R2 = 0.80) and a low RMSE of 0.044. Furthermore, compared to the NIRv or FCVI-based approaches for R2F corrections, saR2F offers a more physically plausible and interpretable solution that can be applied to angular correction and total SIF estimation. The effective mitigation of the black-soil problem facilitates interpretation of raw SIF observations and enhances the monitoring of photosynthetic activity using SIF."

 Accurately characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil freeze depth (SFD) is critical for understanding the response of frozen soils to climate change. Existing SFD mapping schemes mainly focus on annual maximum values, rarely address monthly variations, and fail to capture both spatiotemporal heterogeneity and physical constraints. We developed a monthly SFD mapping scheme (MSFDmap) that considers spatiotemporal heterogeneity in heat transfer capability. Based on the simplified Stefan equation, which is physically constrained by energy conservation, MSFDmap first predicts the spatial distribution of monthly heat transfer factor (HTF) using a random forest regression model driven by soil clay content, precipitation, soil bulk density, soil organic carbon content, soil water content, and leaf area index, and then maps monthly SFD. MSFDmap was implemented using 2123 site-month observations from 60 pan-Arctic sites over 20 years. Results show that MSFDmap achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.21 cm and an R2 of 0.91 for monthly SFD estimates, reducing RMSE by 24–55 % and improving R2 by 8–65 % over existing schemes. For monthly SFD averaged across sites, estimates exhibit strong temporal agreement with quasi-true SFD series (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.99, RMSE = 9.13 cm). The MSFDmap-derived SFD distribution exhibits expected latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, with r = 0.60 relative to an ERA5-Land-based reference distribution. These results demonstrate that MSFDmap effectively characterizes the spatiotemporal dynamics of monthly SFD and outperforms existing schemes. It is attributed to the capture of heterogeneous HTF, which enables the representation of SFD heterogeneity under physical constraints."

 Advancements in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery have made it the standard datasource for large-scale operational flood mapping. SAR’s applicability under all-weather conditions and at night is a major advantage. However, challenges remain in mapping low-contrast surface water due to emergent vegetation and heterogenous flood extent variability. To address these issues, we propose a framework applicable for fully automatic flood mapping. The proposed framework was tested using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery in Ribe, Denmark, a site with frequent inundation with highly variable magnitudes. The framework features several novel methods for refining surface water extents with topographical and hydrological contextualization. A bimodal mask is generated from quadtree decomposition and gaussian mixture modelling, in combination with a bimodality test, which enables straightforward determination of local thresholds separating water and background. Mapped flood extents are contextually refined with ancillary topographical and hydrological datasets, using region-growing and linear regression. A nuanced surface water likelihood output is created from a fuzzy logic procedure using image specific backscatter coefficient statistics, topographic position index and height above nearest drainage. Results were verified through comprehensive spatial- and temporal validation, using Sentinel-2 optical imagery, a permanent water dataset, and timeseries of gauged stream water elevation.

 Oil spill incidents are one of the major factors damaging marine ecosystems, and there is an urgent need for effective detection and identification technologies to quickly locate oil spill contamination areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is capable of monitoring the ocean surface under various weather and lighting conditions, but the SAR images often contain dense speckle noise, and popular SAR oil spill image datasets typically lack sufficient polarization information. To overcome these issues, this study introduces a novel polarimetric decomposition method to generate synthetic color image datasets that integrate multiple polarization features, thereby enhancing image texture and contrast. An image denoising module is designed, which reduces noise interference in the color images through an adaptive sampling approach. Furthermore, a novel Transformer-CNN architecture model is proposed, integrating two modules: the Super Visual Attention Transformer and the Directional Multi-Branch Scale Self-Calibration Module.

 Accurately describing the distribution of burned area and fire emissions is essential for fire management and sustainable development. Medium-resolution datasets, such as MCD64A1 Version 6.1 and the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED), indicate a decrease in tropical and subtropical fire activity over the past 20 years. However, these datasets often miss small burned patches, leading to underestimations in heterogeneous landscapes. Southeast Asia (SEA) is a major hotspot for fire activity and biodiversity. This study provides a high-resolution (30 m) dataset of burned area (1990–2023) and fire-related carbon emissions (2001–2023) across SEA, derived from Landsat data. We curated training data from MODIS, VIIRS, and Landsat imagery, used a Random Forest algorithm to predict burned areas, and created monthly burned area maps with 30-meter resolution. Additionally, we simulated fire-related carbon emissions using the GFED framework and high-resolution maps. Our findings reveal an average annual burned area of 125,212 km2 and emissions of 270 Tg C, both significantly exceeding previous estimates from coarse-resolution datasets by 11,771 km2 and 83.67 Tg C, respectively. Both burned area and carbon emissions have remained stable over time, with agricultural and forest fires contributing significantly to the total burned areas and emissions. Forest burning accounts for 49 % of the total burned area, leading to substantial forest loss (12 % of total forest loss) and carbon emissions (76 % of total fire emissions), with an increase since 2001. Agricultural burning contributes 28 % of the burned area and 12 % of carbon emissions in SEA. These results emphasize the importance of high-resolution monitoring for improving fire prediction and management in fragmented landscapes."

 Establishing a high-quality urban sound environment is essential for the sustainable development of modern cities. Estimating the noise pollution levels in urban areas is integral to improving the overall well-being of city dwellers. However, current approaches to noise levels estimation present significant challenges. Existing approaches are highly data-dependent. They either rely on data from noise sampling networks or require urban geographical data related to noise. Moreover, the latter approach often involves relatively complex modeling processes. This reliance on data availability and granularity significantly constrains the applicability of these methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework for urban noise levels estimation, leveraging deep learning techniques and multi-scale, multi-spectral remote sensing imagery. Specifically, we utilize a noise recording device to sample sound pressure level (SPL) data through mobile measurements at various locations during the daytime, a Transformer-based model is then constructed to learn noise-related information embedded in the scale, spectral, and spatial contextual features of Sentinel-2 imagery. The extracted high-dimensional feature vectors are used to quantitatively estimate SPL, with the proposed Noise-Trans-Sentinel model achieving MAE, RMSE, and R2 values of 3.48, 4.68, and 0.63, respectively. Finally, a SHAP method is employed to interpret the model, exploring the role of multi-scale and multi-spectral remote sensing information in urban noise levels estimation. Our proposed framework enables and validates low-cost, spatially continuous noise estimation in urban areas. It fills a critical gap by demonstrating, for the first time, that high-resolution urban noise mapping can be achieved solely from remote sensing imagery, without relying on dense sensor networks or GIS data. This research contributes to cross-modal studies in urban environmental science and informs the optimization of urban soundscapes."

 Biomass combustion represents a significant source of particulate matter, posing substantial risks to both human health and the environment. This study underscores bio-coal briquettes as a promising solid fuel for residential applications, with the potential to significantly curtail PM2.5 emissions. The PM2.5 emissions were quantified using URG cyclones and quartz-fiber filters. PAHs were analyzed via GC/MS, and PM morphology via SEM-EDS. The quantitative analysis particularly examines the influence of diverse furnace types, ignition modes, and biomass blending ratios on PM2.5 emissions during bio-coal briquettes combustion. A quadratic function model is formulated to elucidate the correlations between the PM2.5 emission factors and the volatile as well as ash content. Furthermore, the presence of ash in the samples exacerbates the production of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the flue gas during combustion. Optimal conditions (20 % straw, semi-gasifier, upper ignition) reduced PM2.5 emissions to 4.9 mg/g (vs. 24.9 mg/g in conventional furnaces). Quadratic models linked volatile matter (R2 ≥ 0.97) and ash content (R2 ≥ 0.99) to PM2.5. Under these parameters, the emission factors for 16 PAHs, including benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), as well as water-soluble cations and ions, are observed at their lowest levels, demonstrating superior emission reduction efficacy. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the collected PM2.5 exhibited a variety of morphologies and structures.

 It is known that dust storms frequently occur during the summer in southern Tajikistan, mainly from satellite-based observations. However, a comprehensive understanding of dust characteristics remains limited due to the scarcity of continuous ground-based measurements. In June of 2023, we established an observational station for investigating the physical and optical properties of dust aerosols in Shaartuz, southern Tajikistan. This study reports dust storms that occurred from July 19 to 26, 2023, focusing on the spatiotemporal distribution and sources of dust aerosols. It is shown that both number and mass concentrations of particles exceeding 10 μm remained substantial throughout the observation period, confirming the persistent presence of coarse-mode dust particles. During the event, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations near the ground reached up to 3841 μg/m3 and 695 μg/m3, respectively, coinciding with the dust storm outbreak on July 19. Two coexisting distinct dust layers were found based on statistical analysis of lidar-derived depolarization ratio and color ratio. The lower layer, located below approximately 1.6 km, was predominantly impacted by air masses from northwest Central Asia, whereas the higher elevated layer distributed between 2.2 km and 4 km, was originated from the southern desert regions. Moreover, optical properties of these two dust layers are largely different, indicating that impact of dust aerosols originated from various dust sources on climate in southern Tajikistan may complex. These results highlight the characteristics of the spatiotemporal evolution, transport pathways of dust aerosols, helping to further evaluate their climatic and environmental impacts in southern Tajikistan.

 In recent years, the phenomenon of nocturnal ozone increase (NOI) has become increasingly common worldwide. The occurrence of such events can potentially enhance the risk of ozone pollution, but the connection between NOI events and ozone pollution remains poorly understood. Based on ground observations, ERA5 dataset and air quality models (CMAQ and CAMx), this study investigates the characteristics of ozone pollution and NOI concurrent events in Xinxiang, China from 2017 to 2021, and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzes the triggering factors on a typical persistent concurrent event (PCE, June 13–20, 2017). We identify the relationship between summer ozone pollution and NOI events. On ozone pollution days, NOI is more prone to occur (incidence: 46.8 %). At the same time, the occurrence of NOI events tends to cause a higher ozone base in the morning from 04:00 to 10:00 local time (LT, 9.12–16.20 μg m−3 higher than that of non-NOI days), promoting the emergence of ozone pollution. During PCE, for all NOI events (12 times) and ozone pollution, vertical diffusion (VDIF) is the primary trigger, followed by regional transport from the latitudinal (north-south) direction (YADV), which is mainly distributed in central and southern Henan (especially Zhengzhou). Additionally, local emissions from industry and transportation also have a significant influence on ozone levels in Xinxiang. This study identifies the characteristics and relationship between NOI events and ozone pollution, and reveals the formation mechanism of PCE, which provides new insights into NOI research and will promote local ozone pollution prevention and control."

 The evolution of the Thermal Internal Boundary Layer (TIBL) under Sea Breeze Circulation (SBC) plays a crucial role in pollutant dispersion, particularly in coastal urban areas. This study investigates the TIBL height (TIBLH) during a severe O3 pollution episode in Hangzhou on June 5, 2016, using high-resolution simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Traditional parameterizations such as the MK1992 method tend to overestimate TIBLH by neglecting urban heat island (UHI) effects and he inland enhancement of momentum by the SBC. To address these limitations, we develop an improved scheme, HS 2024, which explicitly incorporates both the UHI-driven thermal convection and SBC-induced mechanical turbulence. Compared to MK 1992, HS2024 more accurately captures the diurnal evolution of TIBLH and its modulation of vertical O3 transport. As the SBC progresses inland, the TIBLH gradually decreases and forms a capping layer that traps pollutants in the lower troposphere, exacerbating near-surface O3 concentrations. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for both thermal and dynamical processes in TIBLH estimation and provide a more physically grounded framework for air quality prediction in complex coastal cities."

Shortly after internalization,Francisellaassociates with DC mitochondria, which leads to the rapid repurposing of their oxidative metabolism for production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Mitochondrial metabolic rewiring is orchestrated by the intramitochondrial signaling mediated by protein acetylation and involves switching to glutamate as the primary substrate for DC tricarboxylic acid cycle. Rather than killing the bacterium, glutamate-fueled mtROS production activates p38-dependent proinflammatory gene expression.

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway repairs stalled replication forks (RFs) and prevents such instability. Through an E3 ubiquitin ligase screen aimed at identifying regulators of RAD51, we identified macrophage erythroblast attacher (MAEA), a core component of C-terminal to Lish (CTLH) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, as a regulator of the HR pathway. Loss of MAEA impairs RAD51 recruitment at stalled RFs, leading to increased sensitivity to RS-inducing agents and excessive degradation of nascent DNA strands. Mechanistically, MAEA associates with and mediates the ubiquitylation of Ku80, enabling its removal from RF ends and facilitating the loading of RAD51. Notably, MAEA deficiency is associated with a developmental disorder involving microcephaly, craniofacial abnormalities, ocular defects, and heart malformations.

10.1126/sciadv.adv7033,False,Science Advances,该论文主要研究的是灵长类动物（猕猴）大脑前颞叶（ATL）神经元如何实现声音身份识别的不变性，即无论声音的声学特征如何变化，都能识别出说话者。研究发现，ATL中的神经元通过动态的群体编码来支持不变的声音身份表征，从而最小化同一说话者不同发声之间的神经距离，同时保持不同说话者的独特轨迹。这与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析，没有直接关系。,[],Margherita Giamundo;Régis Trapeau;Etienne Thoret;Luc Renaud;Thomas Brochier;Pascal Belin,Voice identity invariance by anterior temporal lobe neurons,"The ability to recognize speakers by their voice despite acoustical variation plays a substantial role in primate social interactions. Although neurons in the macaque anterior temporal lobe (ATL) show invariance to face viewpoint, whether they also encode abstract representations of caller identity is not known. Here, we demonstrate that neurons in the voice-selective ATL of two macaques support invariant voice identity representations through dynamic population-level coding. These representations minimize neural distances across different vocalizations from the same individual while preserving distinct trajectories for different callers. This structure emerged from the coordinated activity of the broader neuronal ensemble, although a small subset of highly identity-selective neurons carried high identity information. Our findings provide a neural basis for voice identity recognition in primates and highlight the ATL as a key hub for integrating perceptual voice features into higher-level identity representations."

The functional significance of DKC1 up-regulation and the mechanistic connection between pseudouridylation and IRES-mediated translation remain poorly understood. Here, we report that DKC1 drives an ATF4-mediated transcriptional program that supports amino acid metabolism and stress adaptation. We identify hnRNP A1, an IRES trans-acting factor, as a critical downstream mediator of DKC1 in sustaining ATF4 expression and IRES-dependent translation. Mechanistically, DKC1-mediated pseudouridylation at two specific 28Sribosomal RNA sites is crucial for maintaining hnRNP A1 protein expression. In turn, hnRNP A1 binds and stabilizes ATF4 messenger RNA, preferentially promoting IRES-dependent translation of ATF4 variant 1. Furthermore, cellular stress induces hnRNP A1, which is necessary for stress-induced ATF4 protein expression. Collectively, our findings uncover an MYC-driven DKC1-hnRNP A1 axis that links IRES-dependent translation and ATF4-mediated metabolic adaptation, thereby supporting cancer cell survival under metabolic stress during tumor progression."

Alpizar;Akira Sawa;Bert Brône,Cytoskeletal control in adult microglia is essential to restore neurodevelopmental synaptic and cognitive deficits,"Synaptic dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), often linked to genes involved in cytoskeletal regulation. While the role of these genes has been extensively studied in neurons, microglial functions such as phagocytosis are also dependent on cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that disturbance of actin cytoskeletal regulation in microglia, modeled by genetically impairing the scaffold protein Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), which integrates actin-binding proteins, causes a shift in actin regulatory balance favoring filopodial versus lamellipodial actin organization. The resulting microglia-specific dysregulation of actin dynamics leads to excessive uptake of synaptic proteins. Genetically engineered DISC1-deficient mice show diminished hippocampal excitatory transmission and associated spatial memory deficits. Reintroducing wild-type microglia-like cells via bone marrow transplantation in adult DISC1-deficient mice restores the synaptic function of neurons and rescues cognitive performance. These findings reveal a pivotal role for microglial actin cytoskeletal remodeling in preserving synaptic integrity and cognitive health. Targeting microglial cytoskeletal dynamics may effectively address cognitive impairments associated with NDDs, even in adulthood."

Swanson,Excitotoxic neuronal death requires superoxide entry into neurons through volume-regulated anion channels,"Neuronal death in stroke and other conditions stems in part from stimulation ofN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)–type glutamate receptors. This induces neuronal production of both nitric oxide and superoxide, which together induce oxidative cell injury. Nitric oxide can readily cross lipid membranes, but superoxide, being an anion, cannot. Using primary neuronal cultures, we show that superoxide enters neurons through volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs). Oxidative injury produced by either exogenous superoxide or NMDA receptor stimulation is prevented by the VRAC inhibitor [4-(2-butyl-6,7-dichlor-2-cyclopentylindan-1-on-5-yl)oxybutyric acid] (DCPIB) and by disruption of the essential VRAC subunit, leucine-rich repeat–containing 8A (LRRC8A). In mouse cortex, neuronal oxidative injury induced by either NMDA or transient ischemia is likewise blocked by both DCPIB and LRRC8A disruption. Selective expression of LRRC8A/C and LRRC8A/D but not LRRC8A/D subunits conferred superoxide conductance in HeLa cells. Superoxide entry through VRACs is thus a requisite step in excitotoxic neuronal injury, and interventions affecting VRAC subunit composition, localization, or opening could influence neuronal survival."

We lack a mechanistic understanding of how environmental changes reshape the resulting bimodal rest-activity pattern. Here, we uncover a seasonal switch mechanism that remodels the evening bout of activity. Under temperate summer-like conditions, levels of the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptide diminish, triggering a cascade. Lowered PDF receptor (PDFR) signaling disinhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3/SHAGGY to advance the evening output, and in parallel, weakens the siesta-promotingvcDN1p-SIFamideaxis to expand the evening peak. Under these conditions,vcDN1p takes over the evening pacemaker role by exerting control over the dorsal lateral oscillator neurons. Our findings elucidate how environment-induced changes in PDFR signaling tip the balanced output of the clock network, aligning daily rhythms with seasonal time. Neuropeptide-driven parallel adjustment of clock circuitry and clock protein functioning likely represents a conserved strategy, enabling animals to adapt their daily behavior to seasonal changes."

This study developed a radiomics-based approach to enhance the preoperative assessment of PTC. Imaging features from 255 patients were analyzed, and three tumor clusters were identified via unsupervised clustering, with one cluster (Cluster 2) displaying favorable clinical and molecular profiles. A radiomics score was constructed and validated internally and externally, achieving high diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve of 0.98) and independently predicting benign features such as a lower N stage and favorable treatment responses. Transcriptomic analysis revealed immune activation and survival-related gene expression in Cluster 2. The model demonstrated robust performance in stratifying patients for active surveillance and may complement current diagnostic frameworks, offering a precise, noninvasive tool to guide clinical decision-making."
