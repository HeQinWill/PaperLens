10.5194/amt-17-7169-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究了一种利用微波辐射计观测数据反演降雨期间低层大气温度剖面的新方法。以往微波辐射计在降雨情况下通常无法准确测量大气参数，因为雨滴会严重影响信号。该研究通过选择特定的频率和仰角，并排除某些频率和天顶观测，有效地降低了雨滴的影响，从而成功反演了降雨期间的低层温度剖面。研究结果表明，该方法在降雨强度小于2.5 mm h−1的情况下能够获得较好的精度，为提高天气预报和气候研究的准确性提供了新的途径。该方法的有效性通过与数值天气预报模式的对比结果进行了验证。,"['temperature profile', 'microwave radiometer', 'atmospheric remote sensing', 'rain effect', 'numerical weather prediction']",Andreas Foth;Moritz Lochmann;Pablo Saavedra Garfias;Heike Kalesse-Los,Determination of low-level temperature profiles from microwave radiometer observations during rain,"Microwave radiometers are usually not able to provide atmospheric quantities such as temperature profiles during rain. We present a method based on a selection of specific frequencies and elevation angles from microwave radiometer observations. A comparison with a numerical weather prediction model shows the presented method allows low-level temperature profiles during rain to be resolved, with rain rates of up to 2.5 mm h−1,, which was not possible before with state-of-the-art retrievals. 
 Usually, microwave radiometer observations have to be discarded during rain. The radomes of the receiver antenna get wet, which hampers accurate measurements since the retrieval algorithms to derive atmospheric quantities are not trained for rain events. The reason for the latter is, that the raindrops dominate the microwave signal compared to the weaker signal from atmospheric gases. To account for this, radiative transfer simulations need to include the electromagnetic properties of rain, which usually requires more complicated and expensive simulations. In this work, the performance of newly developed microwave radiometer retrievals that are not based on rain simulations is evaluated to assess how they work during rain events. It is shown that it is possible to retrieve low-level temperature profiles during rain by omitting certain frequencies and zenith observations. Retrievals with various combinations of elevation angles and frequencies are evaluated. We show that retrievals based on scanning mode observations with angles below 30° without zenith observation and only the less transparent upper four HATPRO microwave radiometer frequencies of the V-band (54.94, 56.66, 57.3, 58 GHz) provide the best results. An analysis of the calculated degrees of freedom of the signal shows that the retrieval of temperature profiles up to 3 km for no rain, 1.5 km for light to moderate rain, and 1 km for very heavy rain is driven by the HATPRO observation and not by climatology. Finally, the performance of the temperature profile retrieval is explained using a case study in Lindenberg, Germany, and evaluated with temperature profiles from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model for different rainfall intensities. The results show that the higher the rainfall rate, the larger the deviation of the retrieved microwave radiometer temperature profile from the ECMWF model output. The proposed retrievals for temperature profiles up to at least 1.5 km for rain rates below 0.5 and below 2.5 mm h−1 have uncertainties of less than 1 and 2 K, respectively, compared to ECMWF model output profiles."

Retrievals from a machine learning algorithm are used to provide a priori states, and a radiative transfer model is used to create lookup tables for later iteration processes. The new method combines the advantages of traditional and machine learning algorithms, and it is applicable to both daytime and nighttime conditions. 
 While traditional thermal infrared retrieval algorithms based on radiative transfer models (RTMs) could not effectively retrieve the cloud optical thickness of thick clouds, machine-learning-based algorithms were found to be able to provide reasonable estimations for both daytime and nighttime. Nevertheless, stand-alone machine learning algorithms are occasionally criticized for the lack of explicit physical processes. In this study, RTM simulations and a machine learning algorithm are synergistically utilized using the optimal estimation (OE) method to retrieve cloud properties from thermal infrared radiometry measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In the new algorithm, retrievals from a machine learning algorithm are used to provide a priori states for the iterative process of the OE method, and an RTM is used to create radiance lookup tables that are used in the iteration processes. Compared with stand-alone OE, the cloud properties retrieved by the new algorithm show an overall better performance by using statistical a priori information obtained by the machine learning algorithm. Compared with the stand-alone machine-learning-based algorithm, the radiances simulated based on retrievals from the new method align more closely with observations, and physical radiative processes are handled explicitly in the new algorithm. Therefore, the new method combines the advantages of RTM-based cloud retrieval methods and machine learning models. These findings highlight the potential for machine-learning-based algorithms to enhance the efficacy of conventional remote sensing techniques."

Gijsbert Tilstra;Ad Stoffelen;Damien Josset;Piet Stammes,Aeolus lidar surface return (LSR) at 355 nm as a new Aeolus Level-2A product,"The Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN) on the Aeolus satellite was the first of its kind to measure high-resolution vertical profiles of aerosols and cloud properties from space. We present an algorithm that produces Aeolus lidar surface returns (LSRs), containing useful information for measuring UV reflectivity. Aeolus LSRs matched well with existing UV reflectivity data from other satellites, like GOME-2 and TROPOMI, and demonstrated excellent sensitivity to modeled snow cover. 
 The Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN) aboard Aeolus was the first spaceborne high-resolution lidar and measured vertical profiles of aerosol optical properties at 355 nm at an incidence angle of ∼ 35°. Although Aeolus was primarily developed to provide vertical profiles of wind speed, aerosols and cloud products, its lidar surface returns (LSRs) have been shown to contain useful information about ultraviolet (UV) surface reflectivity and have agreed well with passive remote sensing reflectance. With a focus on the process to incorporate the LSR algorithm into the Aeolus Level-2A product, we describe the methodology and evaluate the results of the adopted LSR retrieval. The algorithm combines attenuated backscattering parameters (Level-2 Aeolus Profile Processor Algorithm, L2 AEL-PRO, data) with information on the surface bin detection (Level-1 data) to produce attenuated LSR estimates (e.g., surface-integrated attenuated backscatter) for all bins where the ground was detected. The correction for producing final LSR estimates at the original Aeolus resolution is performed using the Aeolus L2 retrievals, namely, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Rayleigh optical depth, to ensure that LSRs are free of the effects of atmospheric attenuating features, such as optically thick clouds and thick aerosol conditions (AOD > 1.0). The evaluation shows that Aeolus LSR estimates produced using this approach agree well with the UV Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (LER) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2; LERG) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI; LERT) climatologies at all spatial scales. For four reference orbits (10 September 2018, 30 November 2018, 11 January 2019 and 1 May 2019), all cloud and aerosol-free LSR estimates agree well with both LER references, with correlation coefficient (r) values varying from 0.55 to 0.71. For monthly scales, the agreement was moderate to high for the LSR–LERT  comparison (r = 0.61–0.77 depending on the month) and weak to moderate for the LSR–LERG comparison (r = 0.44–0.64). Globally, the averaged 2.5° × 2.5° LSR estimates exhibit very high agreement with both the LERG (0.90) and LERT (0.92) references. With respect to reproducing the regional monthly dynamics, LSR and LER agree very well in snow- or ice-covered regions (r > 0.90), semiarid regions (r > 0.90), arid regions (r > 0.70), and some regions with mixed vegetation (like Australia; r = 0.94), whereas no agreement was found for ocean regions due to the Aeolus optical setup, which is favorable for the ocean subsurface but not for direct surface backscatter probing. We unveiled four reflectivity clusters of LSRs at the 2.5° × 2.5° grid scale, manifesting a transition from white to darker surfaces in descending LSR magnitude order: (1) ice, (2) snow, (3) surface without snow and (4) water. Regionally, the LSR–LER agreement can vary and yields the highest correlation values in regions where snow is present in winter, indicating the excellent sensitivity of Aeolus LSRs to white surfaces such as snow. This finding is corroborated by the very good agreement of LSRs with modeled snow cover that we demonstrated (r = 0.62–0.74 between these parameters in such regions), while the sensitivity to purely vegetation-driven changes in the surface is lower, as indicated by the comparison between LSRs and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) without snow (r < 0.30 in the regional analysis). By demonstrating the usability of LSRs for scientific applications at non-nadir angles, our work deepens the knowledge about LSRs, which has mostly been based on nadir-looking Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) studies in the past. Using experiences from both the nadir-looking CALIPSO and the highly non-nadir Aeolus mission, a framework for the effective LSR utilization using future lidar missions such as EarthCARE and Aeolus-2 can be effectively designed."

Law;Anja Engel,Pronounced Diel Cycling of Dissolved Carbohydrates and Amino Acids in the Surface Ocean and across Diverse Regimes,"The metabolism of phytoplankton cells is synchronized with the diel light cycle. Likewise, associated heterotrophic bacteria adjust their diel expression of transporter- and catabolism-related genes to target the dissolved organic matter released by the phytoplankton cell. Dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO) and dissolved amino acids (DAA) are major phytoplankton products and bacterial substrates. Here, we show that diel variations of DCCHO and DAA concentrations accounted for a significant turnover of the total organic carbon (TOC) pool (up to 5.0%, at a rate of 0.37 μM C h–1) and total organic nitrogen (TON) (up to 5.5%, 0.04 μM N h–1) across diverse oceanic regimes (sub-Antarctic to subtropical waters of the Southwestern Pacific Ocean). Glucose contributed most to the observed carbon turnover, while polar amino acids dominated the nitrogen turnover. DAA concentration and composition correlated with viral abundance, suggesting that viral lysis may have caused the the highest DAA concentration at night. Our finding of diel cycling of major dissolved organic phytoplankton products supports the notion of universally synchronized ecosystem dynamics. Such periodicity may enhance nutrient cycling and thus primary production and constrains parts of the yet uncharacterized labile organic carbon flux fueling the microbial carbon pump."

However, probing these interactions at relevant scales and through time remains an analytical challenge due to both their complex nature and the need for tools permitting nondestructive and real-time analysis at sufficient spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate the ability and provide analytical recommendations for the submicron-scale characterization of complex mineral-organic microstructures using optical photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) microscopy. Compared to conventional infrared techniques, O-PTIR spectra collected at submicron resolution of environmentally relevant mineral and organic reference compounds demonstrated similar spectral quality and sensitivity. O-PTIR detection sensitivity was greatest for highly crystalline minerals and potentially for low molecular weight organic compounds. Due to photothermal effects, O-PTIR was more sensitive toward organics than minerals compared to conventional IR approaches, even when organics were mineral-bound. Moreover, O-PTIR resolved mineral-bound and unbound organics in a complex mixture at submicron (<500 nm) resolution. Finally, we provide best practices for artifact-free analysis of organic and mineral samples by determining the appropriate laser power using damage thresholds. Our results highlight the potential of O-PTIR microscopy for nondestructive and time-resolved analysis of dynamic microbe-mineral-organic matter interactions in soils and sediments."

However, chemicals are found in the environment as mixtures, and their toxicity is largely unknown. Understanding the hazard posed by chemicals within the mixture is critical to enforce protective measures. Here, we demonstrate the application of bioactivity profiling of environmental water samples using the sentinel and ecotoxicology model species Daphnia to reveal the biomolecular response induced by exposure to real-world mixtures. We exposed a Daphnia strain to 30 sampled waters of the Chaobai River and measured the gene expression response profiles. Using a multiblock correlation analysis, we establish correlations between chemical mixtures identified in 30 water samples with gene expression patterns induced by these chemical mixtures. We identified 80 metabolic pathways putatively activated by mixtures of inorganic ions, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, industrial chemicals, and a set of biocides, pesticides, and pharmacologically active substances. Our data-driven approach discovered both known bioactivity signatures with previously described modes of action and new pathways linked to undiscovered potential hazards. This study demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the complexity of real-world mixture toxicity to characterize the biomolecular effects of a defined number of chemical components based on gene expression monitoring of the sentinel species Daphnia."

This study employs observational data and ERA5 reanalysis to diagnose the phenomenon, revealing that temperature anomalies at 300 hPa are mainly driven by advection and adiabatic processes, which is the second highest recorded from 2000 to 2020. However, diabatic process are significantly important at 700 hPa, being the third highest during the period. The reduction in sea ice, combined with enhanced sinking motion and increased sea‐air temperature difference, together contributes to the variations of diabatic heating. The increased precipitation, exceeding the historical average by 100% along the southwestern shore of Prydz Bay, further induces localized warming. The increased atmospheric pressure associated with the negative Southern Annular Mode phase is the primary cause influencing the advection, adiabatic, and diabatic processes."

This study utilizes Global Navigation Satellite System and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data to image the spatial distribution of interseismic coupling before the Wushi event along the MDF. The four asperities we identified indicate a high seismic risk for the MDF, with potential magnitudes of Mw 7.5–7.6, Mw 7.5–7.7, Mw 7.0–7.2, and Mw 6.8–7.0. Specifically, the Maierkaiqi segment has already accumulated seismic moment comparable to previous event. Furthermore, our comparison of the interseismic coupling model with the coseismic rupture of the Wushi earthquake reveals that the shallow compliant zone, creeping patches, and irregular fault geometry collectively constrained the rupture propagation. The consistency between the rupture and high coupling area also suggests that the obtained coupling distribution may represent potential earthquake‐prone zones along the MDF."

We found that the timing of the O/N2 equinox transition from winter to summer or vice versa exhibits a progression with latitude, particularly, near spring equinox. The O/N2 equinox transition is far slower during spring compared to fall, leading to a remarkable seasonal asymmetry. Ionospheric Connection Explorer observed a prominent asymmetry in the summer‐to‐winter circulation in the middle to upper thermosphere, implying that the inter‐hemispheric circulation plays a crucial role in the O/N2 equinox transition. Additionally, since the wave‐driven meridional circulation in the lower thermosphere displays a seasonal asymmetry between the northward‐to‐southward and southward‐to‐northward transitions, we would anticipate that the O/N2 equinox transition is also influenced by the lower atmospheric forcing."

Convective environment variability within areas representative of reanalysis data sets is quantified using large‐domain, high‐resolution (∆x = 100 m) simulations of convective cloud systems throughout the tropics and subtropics. Even after removing locations of resolved clouds and precipitation, convective environment parameters vary significantly on these scales. For example, for half of the simulated data, 500 hPa relative humidity varies by ∼30% within a typical reanalysis area. Surface winds, convective available potential energy, and middle‐tropospheric moisture are the most variable convective environment parameters for both continental and maritime regimes, while above‐surface temperature and winds are the least variable. While high‐resolution, sub‐reanalysis‐scale extrema are well‐correlated with the reanalysis‐area mean values, some of the most extreme convective environments can occur within regions with moderate reanalysis‐area mean values, particularly for continental regions."
10.1029/2024GL112774,False,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注气候模型(CMIP5和CMIP6)中内部变率和强迫气候反馈之间的关系。研究发现，CMIP6相对于CMIP5，其内部变率反馈对强迫反馈的预测能力提高了50%以上，这主要归因于对气候变化的缓慢响应(超过20年)。文章还指出，这种预测能力的提高与CMIP6中内部和强迫温度变化模式的相似性增加有关，这表明温度模式效应在预测强迫气候反馈中起着关键作用。尽管预测能力有所提高，但由于观测记录较短，观测到的内部变率提供的紧急约束仍然较弱，并且从CMIP5到CMIP6基本没有变化。总的来说，文章的核心是气候变化预测的改进和局限性，而非大气环境遥感技术本身。,"['Temperature', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Models', 'CMIP5', 'CMIP6']",Luke L.

Here we probe and interpret the differences in these relationships between the climate change projections provided by the CMIP5 and CMIP6 experiment ensembles. We find that internal variability feedbacks better predict forced feedbacks in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5 by over 50%, and that the increased predictability derives primarily from the slow (>20 years) response to climate change. A key novel result is that the increased predictability is consistent with the higher resemblance between the patterns of internal and forced temperature changes in CMIP6, which suggests temperature pattern effects play a key role in predicting forced climate feedbacks. Despite the increased predictability, emergent constraints provided by observed internal variability are weak and largely unchanged from CMIP5 to CMIP6 due to the shortness of the observational record."

Consequently, most studies have focused on seismic‐to‐electromagnetic conversions at fluid/poroelastic and poroelastic/poroelastic interfaces. However, when investigating permeable zones in unfractured media, often associated with geothermal reservoirs, poroelastic/elastic interfaces must be considered. To address this, we conducted laboratory and numerical experiments using a container filled with quartz sand saturated with a NaCl solution, with one of five thin layers made of different materials (four elastic and one poroelastic) embedded within the sand. Our numerical simulations assume an elastic medium as poroelastic using limiting values for certain physical parameters. The results confirm that seismoelectric conversion occurs at poroelastic/elastic transitions, showing a strong agreement between experiments and simulations. Furthermore, we inferred that the amplitudes of electromagnetic waves generated at poroelastic/elastic interfaces are mainly controlled by contrasts of dielectric permittivity."

Two WindBornes continuously sampled inside and near the center of the TPV at various vertical levels for 27 hr before the cyclogenesis. The 27 hr were divided into three phases based on the different vertical levels sampled by WindBornes. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the forecasted cyclone is reduced from 12‐hr to 36‐hr forecast lead time as more phases of WindBornes are assimilated. This period corresponds to when the surface cyclone becomes superimposed with the TPV and rapidly deepens. Comparing the experiment with three phases of WindBorne observations assimilated versus the baseline, the cyclone expands southwestwards toward the TPV and forms a stronger coupled structure. Two analysis improvements leading to the improved AC predictability are revealed. First, a stronger circulation at and below the tropopause of the TPV is observed, leading to stronger coupling between the TPV and the surface cyclone in the forecast. Second, a mesoscale shortwave embedded in the synoptic trough is better constrained as more phases of WindBorne are assimilated. The north part of the TPV, which evolves from the shortwave trough, is therefore forecasted to be stronger. The sensitivity of forecast performance to horizontal localization parameter of the WindBorne observations is also studied. Larger localization parameters result in larger RMSE reduction compared to smaller values."

Standard BG/EP conservation equations assume a fixed connection between mean‐state entropy and pressure that breaks down when composition varies. New entropy‐corrected (EC) forms of these equations are derived that conserve total energy and momentum in atmospheres where composition varies. Three separate and largely independent derivations are presented that all lead to the same EC forms of these equations and their associated diagnostics, such as nonacceleration conditions. Since EC forms present as corrective scaling factors to standard BG/EP equations, existing models and diagnostics are easily generalized. Representative thermospheric calculations reveal that the EC equations remove systematic energy and momentum biases of up to 40% that in turn lead steady conservative waves to grow more rapidly in amplitude with increasing altitude."

This study is based on the comparison between global climate simulations (ARPEGE‐Climat) and reference aerosol data sets (reanalyzes, ground‐based observations and satellite data). First, our results demonstrate the need to constrain the injection heights in the model in order to realistically represent extinction vertical profiles observed during fire events, both in the troposphere and in the lower stratosphere due to the contribution of pyro‐convection. Without specific vertical emission profiles for fires, the ARPEGE‐Climat simulations fail in representing aerosol extinction vertical profiles. For each region studied, the modeled aerosol optical depth (AOD) is extremely high (above 3 at 550 nm). An important long‐range transport of BBA emitted in Australia and California is shown, with high AOD further from sources. These extremely dense plumes significantly perturb the surface incident solar radiation and exert a large direct (surface) shortwave radiative effect up to −13, −29 and −17 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ on monthly average over Australia (January 2020), California (September 2020) and Siberia (August 2019), respectively. A noteworthy positive BBA direct radiative effect (warming) is found at the top of the atmosphere, when dense and strongly absorbing smoke plumes are advected over cloudy oceanic regions, characterized by high surface albedo. This absorption leads to an increase of the solar heating rate up to 0.3 K day−1 ${\text{day}}^{-1}$ with possible implications on the atmospheric temperature and dynamics."

Future flood risk assessment has primarily focused on heavy rainfall as the main driver, with the assumption that projected increases in extreme rain events will lead to subsequent flooding. However, the presence of and changes in vegetation have long been known to influence the relationship between rainfall and runoff. Here, we extract historical (1850–1880) and projected (2070–2100) daily extreme rainfall events, the corresponding runoff, and antecedent conditions simulated in a prominent large Earth system model ensemble to examine the shifting extreme rainfall and runoff relationship. Even with widespread projected increases in the magnitude (78% of the land surface) and number (72%) of extreme rainfall events, we find projected declines in event‐based runoff ratio (runoff/rainfall) for a majority (57%) of the Earth surface. Runoff ratio declines are linked with decreases in antecedent soil water driven by greater transpiration and canopy evaporation (both linked to vegetation greening) compared to areas with runoff ratio increases. Using a machine learning regression tree approach, we find that changes in canopy evaporation is the most important variable related to changes in antecedent soil water content in areas of decreased runoff ratios (with minimal changes in antecedent rainfall) while antecedent ground evaporation is the most important variable in areas of increased runoff ratios. Our results suggest that simulated interactions between vegetation greening, increasing evaporative demand, and antecedent soil drying are projected to diminish runoff associated with extreme rainfall events, with important implications for society."

 Internal climate variability (ICV) creates a range of climate trajectories, which are superimposed upon the forced response. A single climate model realization may not represent forced change alone and may diverge from other realizations, as well as observations, due to ICV. We use an initial-condition large ensemble of simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) to show that ICV produces a range of outcomes in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Trends in gross primary production (GPP) from 1991 to 2020 differ among ensemble members due to the different climate trajectories resulting from ICV. We quantify how ICV imparts on GPP trends and apply our methodology to the observational record. Observed changes in GPP at two long-running eddy covariance flux towers are consistent with ICV, challenging the understanding of forced changes in the carbon cycle at these locations. A probabilistic framework that accounts for ICV is needed to interpret carbon cycle trends."

 The responses of South Asian Monsoon (SAM) circulation under global warming are known to be highly uncertain, leading to the widespread of SAM rainfall projections among models. Here, we show that the uncertain SAM circulation in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models consists of two robust components that partly offset each other: a weakening component linked to a global thermodynamic constraint and a northward shift component understood through a regional 2D energetic perspective. We further attribute the robust northward shift of SAM circulation to positive cloud feedback over the Eurasia Continent and heat uptake in the Southern Ocean. A set of climate model simulations supports the finding that SAM rainfall increase is primarily due to the northward shift of circulation driven by extratropical processes. This energetic perspective opens new avenues for predicting monsoon rainfall by connecting circulation changes to radiative forcing, feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake."

 The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Tripole (IOT) represent primary modes of interannual variability in the Indian Ocean, impacting both regional and global climate. Unlike the IOD, which is closely related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), our findings unveil a substantial influence of the Australian Monsoon on the IOT. An anomalously strong Monsoon induces local sea surface temperature (SST) variations via the wind-evaporation-SST mechanism, triggering atmospheric circulation anomalies in the eastern Indian Ocean. These circulation changes lead to changes in oceanic heat transport, facilitating the formation of the IOT. Our analysis reveals a strengthening connection between the Australian Monsoon and the IOT in recent decades, with a projected further strengthening under global warming. This contrasts with the diminished coupling between ENSO and IOD in recent decades from observations and model projections, illustrating evolving Indian Ocean dynamics under the warming climate."

 HFC-23 (trifluoromethane) is a potent greenhouse gas released to the atmosphere primarily as a by-product of HCFC-22 (chlorodifluoromethane) synthesis. Since 2020, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol has required Parties to destroy their HFC-23 emissions to the extent possible. Here, we present updated HFC-23 emissions estimated from atmospheric observations. Globally, emissions fell to 14.0 ± 0.9 Gg yr-1 in 2023 from their maximum in 2019 of 17.3 ± 0.8 Gg yr-1, but remained five times higher than reported in 2021. Atmospheric observation-based emissions for eastern China, the world’s largest HCFC-22 producer, were also found to be substantially higher than 2020-2022 reported emissions. We estimate that potential HFC-23 sources not directly linked to HCFC-22 production explain only a minor, albeit highly uncertain, fraction of this discrepancy. Our findings suggest that HFC-23 emissions have not been destroyed to the extent reported by the Parties since the implementation of the Kigali Amendment.

 Shortly after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began in April 2010, a widely spaced passive acoustic monitoring array was deployed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico to document the impacts of this unprecedentedly large and deep offshore oil spill on oceanic marine mammals. The array was subsequently maintained for over a decade. Here we document decadal density declines for seven of eight monitored species groups, including sperm whales (up to 31%), beaked whales (up to 83%), and small delphinids (up to 43%). Declines were observed both within and outside of the surface oil footprint. Though not conclusively linked to the oil spill, the broad spatial and temporal scale of these declines observed for disparate marine mammal species is consistent with Deepwater Horizon impacts. These declines have exceeded and outlasted post-spill damage assessment predictions, suggesting that the offshore ecosystem impacts of Deepwater Horizon may have been larger than previously thought.

 The transboundary impacts of regional war on global food trade remain underexplored, particularly regarding disruptions to production and trade networks. Here we address this gap by developing a rapid assessment framework that integrates remote sensing, policy monitoring, and network analysis to evaluate the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war on global winter cereal production and trade. Using satellite data, we estimated yield reductions for wheat, barley, and oats and analyzed the effects of export-ban policies enacted since February 24, 2022. Our findings indicate that lower- and middle-income countries were disproportionately impacted, as trade networks became fragmented, forming isolated clusters that threatened food accessibility.

 Natural regeneration of Amazon forests offers a promising strategy to mitigate forest loss and advance the goals of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. However, the vast variability in regeneration rates across environmental gradients and over time poses considerable challenges for assessing regeneration success and ecosystem services provision in human-modified landscapes. Here we compiled 448 plots from forest regeneration in the Amazon to investigate the drivers of regrowth capacity and identify robust ecological indicators. By modeling optimal successional trajectories, we estimated reference values for vegetation structure, diversity, and functioning. After 20 years, successful regeneration should reach a minimum basal area of 14 m². ha−¹, at least 34 tree species per 100 individuals, a structural heterogeneity index of 0.27, and 123 Mg.ha−¹ of aboveground biomass. These straightforward indicators and reference values provide a foundational framework for governments and practitioners to assess success and establish targets for Amazon restoration efforts.

 Benguela Niños are episodes of unusual El Niño-like warming in the upwelling zone off the coast of southwest Africa, with consequential impacts on marine ecosystems, coastal fisheries and regional weather. The strongest Benguela Niño in the past 40 years occurred in February–April 1995 with local sea surface temperature anomalies up to 4 °C off the coast of Angola and Namibia. Here, we show that a strong Indian Ocean Dipole in September–November 1994 helped boost the amplitude of the 1995 Benguela Niño through a land bridge involving Congo River discharge. We use atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological data to demonstrate the sequential linkage between Indian Ocean Dipole development, unusually high rainfall in the Congo River basin, high Congo River discharge, low salinity near the Congo River mouth, and southward advection of this low salinity water into the Benguela upwelling region. The low salinity water isolated the surface mixed layer from the thermocline, which limited vertical mixing with colder subsurface waters and led to enhanced sea surface temperature warming. We also discuss how other Indian Ocean Dipole events may have similarly affected subsequent Benguela Niños and the possibility that Indian Ocean Dipole impacts on Benguela Niños may become more prominent in the future.

 Arctic permafrost soils contain a vast reservoir of soil organic carbon (SOC) vulnerable to increasing mobilization and decomposition from polar warming and permafrost thaw. How these SOC stocks are responding to global warming is uncertain, partly due to a lack of information on the distribution and status of SOC over vast Arctic landscapes. Soil moisture and organic matter vary substantially over the short vertical distance of the permafrost active layer. The hydrological properties of this seasonally thawed soil layer provide insights for understanding the dielectric behavior of water inside the soil matrix, which is key for developing more effective physics-based radar remote sensing retrieval algorithms for large-scale mapping of SOC. This study provides a coupled hydrologic-electromagnetic framework to model the frequency-dependent dielectric behavior of active layer organic soil. For the first time, we present joint measurement and modeling of the water matric potential, dielectric permittivity, and basic physical properties of 66 soil samples collected across the Alaskan Arctic tundra. The matric potential measurement allows for estimating the soil water retention curve, which helps determine the relaxation time through the Eyring equation. The estimated relaxation time of water molecules in soil is then used in the Debye model to predict the water dielectric behavior in soil. A multi-phase dielectric mixing model is applied to incorporate the contribution of various soil components. The resulting organic soil dielectric model accepts saturation water fraction, organic matter content, mineral texture, temperature, and microwave frequency as inputs to calculate the effective soil dielectric characteristic. The developed dielectric model was validated against lab-measured dielectric data for all soil samples and exhibited robust accuracy. We further validated the dielectric model against field-measured dielectric profiles acquired from five sites on the Alaskan North Slope. Model behavior was also compared against other existing dielectric models, and an in-depth discussion on their validity and limitations in permafrost soils is given. The resulting organic soil dielectric model was then integrated with a multi-layer electromagnetic scattering forward model to simulate radar backscatter under a range of soil profile conditions and model parameters. The results indicate that low frequency (P-, L-band) polarimetric synthetic aperture radars (SARs) have the potential to map water and carbon characteristics in permafrost active layer soils using physics-based radar retrieval algorithms."

 Melt ponds are a common phenomenon on the surface of Arctic sea ice during the summer, and their low albedo strongly influences the energy balance of the Arctic sea ice. Estimating Melt Pond Fraction (MPF) and Melt Pond Depth (MPD) using optical remote sensing is crucial for a better understanding of rapid climate change in the Arctic region. However, current retrieval algorithms for monitoring Arctic melt ponds using optical imagery often fail to estimate MPD. In this study, a radiative transfer model for melt ponds is establish to describe the relationship between melt pond reflectance and its physical properties. Using Sentinel-2 observation data, we propose a novel algorithm for the simultaneous retrieval of MPF and MPD, thereby enabling the estimation of Melt Pond Volume (MPV). This method does not depend on prior assumptions regarding the spectral reflectance of sea ice and melt ponds, and it accounts for the spatiotemporal variability in their reflectance. Compared with other high-resolution MPF and MPD products, the results of this study demonstrate comparable spatial distributions. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the retrieved MPF is less than 10 %, and the RMSE for MPD is approximately 24.51 cm. The analysis of melt pond evolution along the MOSAiC track shows the rapid expansion of melt ponds and their significant spatial variability. Ultimately, using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning, a dataset of MPF, MPD, and MPV for the Arctic from 2013 to 2023 is generated from 57,842 Landsat-8 images. Correlation analysis shows that MPF, MPD, and MPV all have a positive correlation with downward surface radiation. The approach outlined in this study is entirely based on remote sensing imagery, demonstrating significant potential for large scale application. This offers new opportunities for estimating the volume of water stored in Arctic summer melt ponds."

 Many invasive shrubs in the eastern deciduous forests of the United States use the temporal niche before and after the native tree canopy leaf-on period (leafing out prior to most native species and retaining leaves after most natives senesce) to establish in the light-limited environment of the understory. To support an increased understanding of invasive shrub species’ ecology and distribution patterns and inform better management plans, this key phenological difference needs to be characterized in detail. Here we leveraged the high-resolution observations from the French-Israel VENµS mission to examine the phenological characteristics of a widespread invasive shrub species—Amur honeysuckle (AH; Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Herder)—compared to native deciduous trees in Robinson Forest, Kentucky. VENµS offered daily superspectral (12 narrow bands) observations at 4 m resolution in a limited number of global sites, providing us with crucial data for the analysis. We identified three forest communities with respect to AH presence through field surveys (i.e., uninvaded forest stands, forest stands with AH understory, and AH shrub thickets) and compared their VENµS-derived spectral signatures and time series of vegetation indices. In 2023, AH shrub thickets greened up one month earlier than uninvaded forest stands (mid-March vs. mid-April). AH leaf growth advanced into full green before the canopy tree greenup started in early April, marking an optimal window for isolating areas with AH understory from the uninvaded forest using remote sensing. Based on the phenological differences identified, we predicted the distribution of AH in the study area using a two-date differencing model and a spectral mixture analysis. Our detailed findings using VENµS data offer insights into the temporal dynamics of invasive shrubs and native trees in a typical eastern deciduous forest. While our prediction of the AH distribution was confounded by the presence of native early greening and/or evergreen understory plants at a few locations, it was still moderately accurate (overall accuracy ∼ 70 %) and its abundance estimates agreed with observations in forest stands with minimal native understory growth. Moving forward, high-resolution remote sensing observations combined with a phenology-based approach will likely support more precise monitoring and management of invasive understory plants in native forest ecosystems."

 Compound hazards caused by tropical cyclones involve interactions among multiple hazards, such as wind, rainfall, and storm surge, significantly increasing the uncertainty and destructiveness of disasters. Existing studies primarily focus on probabilistic analyses of single or dual hazards associated with tropical cyclones, revealing limitations in handling high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. This study developed the ComHazAsTC-RRE (Compound Hazard Assessment of Tropical Cyclones within Repeatable, Reproducible, and Expandable Framework) model to analyze the compound hazards of wind, rainfall, and storm surge induced by tropical cyclones and successfully applied it to China’s coast. We collected globally accessible daily records of maximum wind speed, cumulative rainfall, and maximum storm surge for China’s coastal areas from 1979 to 2018. Using a C-Vine Copula with wind speed as the core, incorporating rainfall and storm surge as branches, we accurately captured complex dependencies of tropical cyclones. Our various return period analyses underscore the importance of considering multiple hazards and their interactions. Additionally, the application of Compound Hazard Index in China reveals that southeastern coastal areas are subjected to significantly higher compound hazards, driven by high wind speeds and strong spatial–temporal consistency of hazards. An in-depth analysis of failure probabilities indicates that neglecting the interactions among hazards can result in substantial additional cost for engineering projects, especially during severe tropical cyclones. This study offers new perspectives and scientific tools for understanding and addressing compound hazards, formulating effective disaster prevention and mitigation strategies, and supporting the sustainable development of coastal regions worldwide."

Models suggest that volcanic outgassing of carbon and sulfur—potent environmental stressors—drove global temperature change, but the relative timing, duration, and magnitude of such change remains uncertain. Here, we use the organic paleothermometer MBT′5meand the carbon-isotope composition of two K–Pg-spanning lignites from the western Unites States, to test models of volcanogenic air temperature change in the ~100 kyr before the mass extinction. Our records show long-term warming of ~3°C, probably driven by Deccan CO2emissions, and reveal a transient (<10 kyr) ~5°C cooling event, coinciding with the peak of the Poladpur “pulse” of Deccan eruption ~30 kyr before the K–Pg boundary. This cooling was likely caused by the aerosolization of volcanogenic sulfur. Temperatures returned to pre-event values before the mass extinction, suggesting that, from the terrestrial perspective, volcanogenic climate change was not the primary cause of K–Pg extinction."
