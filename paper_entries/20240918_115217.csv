Since 2017, organized criminal groups (not smallholders) have been establishing coca plantations in Central America for cocaine production. This has broken South America’s long monopoly on coca leaf production for the global cocaine trade and raised concerns about future expansion in the isthmus. Yet it is not clear how much of Central America has suitable biophysical characteristics for a crop domesticated in, and long associated with the Andean region. We combine geo-located data from coca cultivation locations in Colombia with reported coca sites in Central America to model the soil, climate, and topography of Central American landscapes that might be suitable for coca production under standard management practices. We find that 47% of northern Central America (Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize) has biophysical characteristics that appear highly suitable for coca-growing, while most of southern Central America does not. Biophysical factors, then, are unlikely to constrain coca’s spread in northern Central America. Whether or not the crop is more widely planted will depend on complex and multi-scalar social, economic, and political factors. Among them is whether Central American countries and their allies will continue to prioritize militarized approaches to the drug trade through coca eradication and drug interdiction, which are likely to induce further expansion, not contain it. Novel approaches to the drug trade will be required to avert this outcome."

To that end, the United Nations Environmental Program is considering CS as a mechanism for producing ambient water quality data to track progress on sustainable development goal (SDG) indicator 6.3.2: ‘proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality’. However, the alignment of SDG 6.3.2 monitoring requirements with CS capacity and results in low- or middle-income countries has not been assessed. Through a systematic literature review of 49 journal publications, complemented by 15 key informant interviews, this article examines the methods and outputs of CS programs in resource-constrained settings. We explore the potential of these programs to contribute to tracking SDG 6.3.2. Using the CS impact assessment framework, we evaluate broader outcomes of CS programs across 5 domains: society, economy, environment, governance, and science and technology. Despite large variability in scope, CS programs were consistently found to generate useful data for national-level reporting on physicochemical and ecological parameters; however, data quality is a concern for CS measurement of microbiological parameters. The focus in literature to-date is predominantly on scientific data production which falls only within the ‘science and technology’ outcome domain. Societal, governance, economic, and environmental outcomes are infrequently evaluated. Of the studies reviewed in this article, 75% identified some form of pollution but only 22% of them reported follow-up actions such as reporting to authorities. While CS has important potential, work is still needed towards the ‘formalization’ of CS, particularly if intended for more vulnerable contexts."

In China, the pressure to reduce carbon emissions is very great because the responsibility of four participants for economic activities has not been able to break away from the linear economic model of ‘produce-consume-discard’. In this paper, four categories of participants, namely extractors/producers, manufacturers, consumers and recyclers, are classified according to the life cycle framework, and the impact of their activities on carbon emission reduction is analysed taking into account circular economy factors. The results of the study show that during the rapid development of China’s economy from 2005 to 2021, there is a significant correlation between carbon emission reduction and the activity behaviour of the four participants with consideration of circular economy factors. In particular, the activity behaviours of the extractors/producers, manufacturers and consumers have a very strong correlation with the carbon emission reduction. Our findings indicate that China should continue to exert efforts in the existing circular economy model to achieve the double carbon goals."

The intricate and non-linear interactions between PM2.5 and O3 on a national scale over long-term records are not well understood. Here, we proposed a novel multi-layer network approach to bridge the gap. Our findings reveal that the variability of O3 precedes that of PM2.5 by one day. The degree, weighted degree, and edge distance follow a power-law decay distribution, suggesting that their relationship is not a random process. O3 concentration in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region and eastern Shandong Province significantly impacts the PM2.5 levels in surrounding areas. Conversely, PM2.5 concentrations in Shandong Province, Henan Province, YRD and Pearl River Delta (PRD) have a strong influence on O3 levels. Moreover, we quantified the seasonality of the interactions and elucidated the underlying reasons. The results revealed the interactions between PM2.5 and O3 are intricately tied to atmospheric oxidation processes. More specifically, in summer, the atmospheric oxidation has a strong impact on the interactions in key regions, such as the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei,YRD region and Fenwei Plain. However, the PRD region experiences a more pronounced effect from atmospheric oxidation on this relationship in winter. These findings demonstrate that it is crucial to effectively regulate atmospheric oxidation to mitigate PM2.5 and O3. Our results also serve as a valuable methodological framework for understanding the characteristics of pollutants."

Traditional view show that microbial residue C is more resistant to decompose than plant litter because their smaller particle sizes could be preferentially occluded in microaggregates with less microbial accessibility. However, we still lack a quantitative assessment (i.e. isotopic C labeling) to isolate the progressive release of C fractions from both plant and microbial residues. Here we used a global data set of 117 decomposition experiments that traced the 13C or 14C release of isotopically labeled plant and microbial residues to estimate the C release rates and turnover times by using a first-order exponential kinetics model. The average C release rates of crop, grass and tree litter were 7.78, 3.79 and 2.11 yr−1, which were significantly lower than microbial residues (13.07 yr−1). Although C release rates of both plant and microbial residues were positively correlated with site temperature, the mean turnover time of microbial residues was 2–6 times lower than plant litter. We suggest that a constraint in microbial and plant residues leads to a predictable pattern of C release during terrestrial decomposition, which could be included in Earth system models."

Regional agricultural systems have good consistency in agricultural practices, management decisions, social economy, and climate, which is of great significance in ensuring food security. In this study, emergy analysis and the logarithmic mean divisia index method were integrated to construct an evaluation framework from the dimensions of socio-economic environment, resource environment, climate environment, and ecological environment. Then we evaluated and analyzed the changes in agricultural system sustainability from 1990 to 2019 in the mainstream of Liaohe River Basin, a typical agricultural basin in China. The results showed that the Emergy sustainability index (ESI) decreased from 0.17 to 0.14, and factors Δ Pt/Gt (social and economic development level), Δ G/I (agricultural economic benefits), and Δ Gt/G (economic structure) from the socio-economic environment dimension had the greatest impact on changes in ESI. Moreover, society and economy affected the factors in the resource environmental dimensions through the allocation of policies and resources, which in turn directly affected ESI. The influence of factors from the climatic environment and ecological environment weakens as the ability to manage agricultural systems increases. The research provided a reference for the planning and management of sustaining agricultural systems at a regional scale."

Despite their nascence, negative emissions technologies are being incorporated into nationally determined contributions to achieve ambitious targets. It is therefore urgent to build a scaffolding that enables their expansion. Here, we report results from a workshop that brought together 34 prominent stakeholders, including scientists, engineers, energy system analysts, economists, experts in public policy, and policy makers. Participants discussed the likely cost and performance of these technologies; elucidated the opportunities and risks facing deployment; and envisioned how nations might build the necessary scaffolding for expansion. The majority narrative is that negative emissions technologies will have a bridging role in decarbonizing existing assets. Different models of deployment were proposed. Reaching the scale of deployment necessary to meet emissions targets is lengthy and expensive. Financial and regulatory risks are seen as greater barriers to deployment at scale than technological risk. Greater certainty regarding carbon pricing, production tax credits, and support for geological characterization and trunkline construction could reduce the former. Critical to expansion is a large-scale increase in low-carbon power production; the implementation of regulatory frameworks that remove uncertainty surrounding investment decisions; and prudent societal engagement."

The prevention of the key reactive intermediate species nitrite excessive oxidation over the supported noble-metal catalysts, rather than the traditional low-efficiency transition metal oxide catalysts, remains a great challenge. Herein, a sound strategy of Pd single atoms saturated with acidic transition element ligands is proposed. The coexistence of Pd and V dual single atoms strengthens the adsorption of reactants, while synergistic interaction between dual atoms and surface oxygen weakens activation of lattice oxygen, thus significantly reducing the overoxidation of nitrite. Meanwhile, the neutralization of the active Pd and inert V sites results in a rational decrease in the redox property of Pd and an obvious increase in that of V. The Pd1V1/CeO2 dual single-atom catalyst achieves 90% conversion of NOx and toluene at 238 and 230 °C and has a large temperature window (>150 °C) for NOx reduction. This research makes a breakthrough in the development of efficient supported noble-/transition-metal dual single-atom catalysts for VOC and NOx simultaneous purification."

Direct monitoring in sewers can be expensive or biased due to access limitations and internal heterogeneity of sewer networks. Fortunately, since methane is almost exclusively biogenic in sewers, we demonstrate in this study that the methanogenic potential can be estimated using known sewer microbiome data. By combining data mining techniques and bioinformatics databases, we developed the first data-driven method to analyze methanogenic potentials using a data set containing 633 observations of 53 variables obtained from literature mining. The methanogenic potential in the sewer sediment was around 250–870% higher than that in the wet biofilm on the pipe and sewage water. Additionally, k-means clustering and principal component analysis linked higher methane emission rates (9.72 ± 51.3 kgCO2 eq m–3 d–1) with smaller pipe size, higher water level, and higher potentials of sulfate reduction in the wetted pipe biofilm. These findings exhibit the possibility of connecting microbiome data with biogenic greenhouse gases, further offering insights into new approaches for understanding greenhouse gas emissions from understudied sources."

Sivey,Methanol as a Carrier Solvent Can Influence Chlorination Rates of Phenolic Compounds in Chlorinated Waters,"Methanol is commonly used as a carrier solvent in environmental chemistry experiments; however, the possible influence of methanol on the kinetics of chemical transformations is often overlooked. The effects of methanol and other frequently used carrier solvents on the chlorination rates of aromatic precursors of disinfection byproducts during water chlorination were investigated. At concentrations as low as 0.50 vol %, methanol increased chlorination rates of ethylparaben, phenol, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, ethyl 3-hydroxybenzoate, and ethyl 2-hydroxybenzoate. Methanol did not increase the chlorination rates of salicylic acid, dimethenamid, or 1,2-dimethoxybenzene. Ethylparaben and phenol chlorination were especially sensitive to methanol, with pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) increasing by a factor of >2 in water containing 2.0 vol % methanol compared to those in methanol-free controls. Rate enhancements persisted across differing reaction conditions (pH 6–10 and in buffers containing borate or phosphate). The rate enhancements of unsubstituted and para-substituted phenols were larger than those of meta- and ortho-substituted phenols. The carrier solvents acetone, acetonitrile, and tert-butanol had no appreciable impact on the chlorination rates of ethylparaben. Overall, our findings suggest that methanol as a carrier solvent can cause systematic errors in lab-scale chlorination experiments. To avoid experimental artifacts, researchers should prepare stock solutions in water (when feasible) or minimize carrier solvent concentrations present in reaction solutions."

Reactivity between HOCl/Cl2 and limonene, a common constituent of indoor air, has been observed. The purpose of this study was to characterize the chemical species generated from gas-phase reactions between HOCl/Cl2 and limonene. Gas-phase reactions were prepared in Teflon chambers housing HOCl, Cl2, and limonene. The resulting chemical products were analyzed using gas-phase preconcentration, followed by gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Several chlorinated products were detected, including limonene species containing one, two, and three chlorines and limonene chlorohydrin. Product concentrations and yields were estimated for the most abundant products, and greater than 80% of  transformed limonene was represented in the detected products. Temporal sampling of the reactions allowed time courses to be plotted for limonene decay and chlorinated limonene product generation under different conditions, including the treatments of HOCl/Cl2, Cl2 only, high vs low relative humidity, and ± ozone. These experiments add product speciation, yield estimates, and an understanding of environmental factors affecting product formation to previous studies, further highlighting the chemical transformations initiated by sodium hypochlorite bleach in indoor air."

Since the 1960s, freshening of the Ross Sea shelf water has led to a decline in Antarctic Bottom Water formation. However, during 2012–2018, salinity of the western Ross Sea has rebounded. This study adopts a global ocean‐sea ice model to investigate the causes of this salinity rebound. Model‐based surface salinity budget analysis indicates that the salinity rebound was driven by increased brine rejection from sea ice formation, triggered by nearly equal effects of local anomalous winds and surface heat flux. The local divergent wind anomalies promoted local sea ice formation by creating a thin ice area, while cooling heat flux anomaly decreased the surface temperature, increasing sea ice production as well. This highlights the importance of understanding local climate variability in projecting future dense shelf water change."

Aerosol forcing through aerosol‐cloud interactions is mostly negative (a cooling) due to shortwave radiation, while feedbacks are positive or negative in different regions due to contrasting longwave and shortwave effects. Both forcing and feedbacks are related to the mean climate state. Higher magnitude cloud radiative effects generally mean larger magnitude net negative forcing and larger magnitude net positive feedback. Aerosol forcing is broadly related to the susceptibility of clouds to drop number. Feedbacks also related to susceptibility, but to a lesser extent and in different regions to aerosol forcing.

 Subduction-induced mantle flow has a considerable geodynamic impact on Earth. It can deflect mantle plumes, transport geochemical signatures and produce upwellings that generate atypical intraplate volcanism. The mantle flow produced by slab rollover subduction, however, remains unstudied, yet it may have a comparable geodynamic significance. Here, we present analogue models of buoyancy-driven subduction in which we image, using a state-of-the-art Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique, the three-dimensional mantle flow induced by two contrasting subduction styles: slab rollback (trench retreat) and slab rollover (trench advance). Our model results show that the advancing subduction mode develops a slab rollover geometry that generates a large-scale upwelling in a broad mantle wedge domain. Based on a comparison between the location of this upwelling and Cenozoic volcanics in Tibet, we propose that slab rollover subduction of the Tethyan and Indian slabs generated a comparably broad mantle upwelling, which drove widespread Cenozoic volcanism in Tibet. Intraplate volcanism inboard of subduction and collision zones, such as in Tibet during the Cenozoic, could be produced by reversed toroidal mantle flow and long-lived upwelling in subduction rollover settings, according to analogue subduction models."

 Mapping water bodies from remotely sensed imagery is crucial for understanding hydrological and biogeochemical processes. The identification of water extent is mainly dependent on optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, the use of remote sensing for water body mapping is often undermined by the mixed pixel dilemma inherent to traditional hard classification approaches. At the same time, the presence of clouds in optical imagery and speckle noise in SAR imagery, coupled with the difficulty in differentiating between water-like surfaces and actual water bodies, significantly compromise the accuracy of water body identification. This paper proposes a DEEP feature collaborative convolutional neural network (CNN) for Water Super-Resolution Mapping based on Optical and SAR images (DeepOSWSRM), which collaboratively leverages Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery to address the challenges of missing data and mixed pixels. The Sentinel-1 image provides complementary water distribution information for the cloudy areas of the Sentinel-2 image, while the Sentinel-2 image enhances the perception capabilities for small water bodies in the Sentinel-1 image. Using PlanetScope imagery as the true reference data, the effectiveness of the proposed method was assessed through two experimental scenarios: one utilizing synthetic coarse-resolution imagery degraded from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and another using actual Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, encompassing both simulated and real cloud conditions. A comparative analysis was conducted against three state-of-the-art CNN-based water mapping methods and two CNN SRM methods. The findings demonstrate that the proposed DeepOSWSRM method successfully produces accurate, fine-resolution water body maps, with its performance mainly benefiting from the fusion of SAR and optical images."

 Land surface emissivity (LSE) is a crucial variable in thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, providing unique information about the land surface across different channels. It is essential for applications such as surface energy budget estimation, resource exploration, and land cover change monitoring. However, current methods for retrieving LSE have certain limitations in terms of applicability or accuracy levels. Furthermore, the relative importance of various parameters in LSE retrieval studies remains unclear. To address these challenges, a practical and transferrable method has been proposed to retrieve LSE of different TIR channels using machine-learning technique. The proposed method uses visible and near-infrared (VNIR) as well as short-wave infrared (SWIR) data at the pixel scale to analyze key parameters for LSE retrieval and to estimate LSE for channels centered around 8.6 μm, 11.0 μm and 12.0 μm. Importance analysis identified crucial variables for LSE retrieval, including reflectivity in channels of SWIR3 (∼2.13 μm), RED (∼0.66 μm) and BLUE (∼0.47 μm), as well as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and the view zenith angle (VZ). Compared to the data used in existing methods, the core variables offer a more comprehensive representation of surface information, potentially enhancing both the accuracy and usability of the proposed method. Using these core variables, LSE was retrieved across eleven study areas through a machine learning method. Cross-validation with MODIS products showed that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the estimated LSE is 0.02 for the channel around 8.6 μm, and 0.01 for the channels around 11.0 μm and 12.0 μm, respectively. Direct-validation with in-situ measurements also demonstrated impressive retrieval accuracies in sandy areas. Furthermore, the model trained using 2019 data exhibited high retrieval accuracy when applied to data from 2017, highlighting its transferability across different time periods. Additionally, the proposed method produced promising results for LSE estimation using Landsat 8 imageries, indicating its potential for generating emissivity products from satellites with high spatial resolution but limited TIR channels."

 The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, hosting the world’s largest alpine pastures, plays a pivotal environmental role in Asia. These ecosystems face alterations driven by both climate change and anthropogenic activities, resulting in the widespread consideration of grassland degradation. From 2000 to 2020, the northern Xizang Plateau experienced a pronounced escalation in drought conditions, particularly following a management policy aimed at combating grassland degradation, via restricting livestock numbers and implementing fencing enclosures, initiated in 2009. Specially, following the enforcement of this policy (2010–2020), there was a substantial 13.5 % reduction in soil moisture levels compared to the pre-implementation period (2000–2009), accompanied by a 42.8 % increase in drought severity (measured by the Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI) and an 11.6 % rise in drought duration. Under these challenging drought conditions, we identified negative trends of potential grassland Net Primary Productivity (NPP) which in absence of anthropogenic influence, as simulated by terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM). Contrary to this simulation, satellite time series observations revealed a widespread increase in actual grassland productivity. Remarkably, despite the challenging drought conditions between 2010 and 2020, we observed a substantial increase of 4.8 % in actual NPP (measured by light use efficiency model), 2.7 % in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), 10 % in solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and 7.95 % in Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), respectively. Much of this enhancement in grassland productivity occurred in areas where livestock populations had markedly declined. Notably, the percentage of NPP increase mainly caused by degradation-combating actions doubled from 24.8 % during 2000–2009 to 49.8 % during 2010–2020 across the northern Xizang Plateau. In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of large-scale degradation-combating actions to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change and contribute to a greener Earth."

 Detecting soil arsenic (As) contamination is crucial for designing efficient soil remediation strategies; however, traditional laboratory-based As detection techniques are time- and labour-intensive and are unsuitable for large-scale spatial analyses. To address this issue, we combined machine learning (ML) with visible-near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy to develop an efficient framework for As detection in soil. The optimal spectral preprocessing method was determined, and eight ML models were compared. The support vector classifier achieved optimal performance after subsequent hyperparameter tuning, with area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy values of 0.89 and 0.83, respectively. Important spectral bands at 471 and 2422 nm were identified by permutation importance and correspond to Fe-oxide and carbonate, respectively. These two wavelengths were included in the partial dependence plot (PDP), revealing that the likelihood of soil As contamination decreased with increasing reflectance at wavelengths of 471 and 2422 nm due to a decrease in Fe-oxide and carbonate content. Consistent with this finding, two-way PDP analysis revealed that the As content of soil increased with increasing Fe-oxide and carbonate content. The model’s classification performance was further improved using an ensemble technique based on three optimal ML models, resulting in increased AUC and accuracy values of 0.9 and 0.83, respectively. Overall, the framework presented in this study enabled the precise classification of soil As content at the continental scale, while also indirectly explained the complex relationships between As content and soil properties."
