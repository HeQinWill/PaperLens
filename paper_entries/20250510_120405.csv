10.5194/acp-25-4847-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了野火烟雾对北极卷云形成的影响。通过分析MOSAiC探险期间的激光雷达和雷达观测数据，发现西伯利亚野火烟雾污染了北极地区的对流层顶，导致该区域气溶胶浓度显著增加。研究表明，这种烟雾污染可能通过异质冰核化过程影响卷云的形成，因为观测到的冰晶数量浓度和冰水含量与烟雾气溶胶的存在密切相关。该研究强调了野火烟雾作为冰核对北极气候的影响，并结合了大气成分分析，特别是气溶胶和冰云的观测。,"['wildfire smoke', 'Arctic cirrus formation', 'aerosol', 'ice cloud', 'lidar', 'radar', 'ice nucleation', 'ice water content (IWC)', 'ice crystal number concentration (ICNC)', 'heterogeneous ice nucleation', 'atmospheric composition']",Albert Ansmann;Cristofer Jimenez;Johanna Roschke;Johannes Bühl;Kevin Ohneiser;Ronny Engelmann;Martin Radenz;Hannes Griesche;Julian Hofer;Dietrich Althausen;Daniel A. Knopf;Sandro Dahlke;Tom Gaudek;Patric Seifert;Ulla Wandinger,Impact of wildfire smoke on Arctic cirrus formation – Part 1: Analysis of MOSAiC 2019–2020 observations,"In this study, we focus on the potential impact of wildfire smoke on cirrus formation. For the first time, state-of-the-art aerosol and cirrus observations with lidar and radar, presented in this paper (Part 1 of a series of two articles), are closely linked to the comprehensive modeling of gravity-wave-induced ice nucleation in cirrus evolution processes, presented in a companion paper (Part 2).  We found a clear impact of wildfire smoke on cirrus evolution. 
 The potential impact of wildfire smoke on Arctic cirrus formation is discussed based on lidar and radar observations during the winter half year of the 1-year MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) expedition. Aerosol and ice cloud observations were performed aboard the icebreaker Polarstern at latitudes > 85° N. Aged Siberian wildfire smoke polluted the tropopause region over the central Arctic during the entire winter half year of 2019–2020. The smoke particle surface area concentration at the tropopause was of the order of 5–15 µm2 cm−3 and indicated considerably enhanced levels of aerosol pollution for more than 6 months. Numerous cirrus systems with cloud-top temperatures between −60 and −75 °C developed in the polluted upper troposphere. We analyzed all MOSAiC winter cirrus layers with respect to their geometrical and optical properties and a subgroup of 20 cirrus events with respect to their ice water content (IWC) and ice crystal number concentration (ICNC). In individual ice fallstreaks that are connected to individual ice nucleation events, ICNCs typically ranged from 1 to 10 crystals L−1 but were frequently also as high as 20–50 L−1; however, observations > 100 L−1 were rare. Three observational facts corroborate our hypothesis that smoke significantly influenced Arctic cirrus formation: (1) the occurrence of a long-lasting, persistent smoke pollution layer in the upper troposphere so that favorable conditions for heterogeneous ice nucleation on smoke particles were always given and, at the same time, homogeneous freezing of background aerosol was probably widely suppressed; (2) the high smoke particle surface area concentrations, which were high enough to significantly trigger ice nucleation on smoke particles (as shown in Part 2, the companion paper to this article; Ansmann et al., 2025); and (3) the frequently found maximum cirrus ice saturation ratios of 1.3–1.5, which point to the dominance of heterogeneous ice nucleation processes, initiated by inefficient ice-nucleating particles (INPs), as expected when aged smoke particles (i.e., organic aerosol particles) serve as INPs. The studies are continued in the simulation portion of this work (Part 2; Ansmann et al., 2025)."
10.5194/acp-25-4867-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了野火烟雾对北极卷云形成的影响。通过模拟研究，结合MOSAiC探险的观测数据，揭示了西伯利亚野火烟雾在2019-2020年冬季对北极卷云形成产生的显著影响。研究利用激光雷达和雷达数据反演气溶胶和卷云信息，并将冰核粒子浓度（INP）作为输入，冰晶数浓度（ICNC）用于验证模拟结果。模拟结果表明，观测到的高空烟雾污染足以触发强烈的冰核化，并抑制均匀冻结，从而使烟雾气溶胶控制卷云的形成和性质。此外，研究还证实了在卷云顶部观测到的高冰饱和度与野火烟雾颗粒作为INP的低效率有关。总的来说，该研究强调了野火烟雾对北极地区大气成分和云形成过程的重要影响。,"['wildfire smoke', 'cirrus formation', 'ice nucleation', 'ice crystal number concentration (ICNC)', 'lidar', 'radar', 'INP concentration', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality']",Albert Ansmann;Cristofer Jimenez;Daniel A.

 A simulation study of the potential impact of wildfire smoke on Arctic cirrus formation is presented. The simulations complement the MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) field observations, discussed in Part 1 (Ansmann et al., 2025) of this work. The observations suggest that Siberian wildfire smoke had a strong impact on Arctic cirrus formation in the winter of 2019–2020. Via simulations, a detailed insight into the potential of wildfire smoke to influence Arctic cirrus formation as a function of observed meteorological and environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity, large-scale and gravity-wave-induced lofting conditions, and ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentration) is provided. Lidar-derived values of the INP concentration serve as input, and ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) values retrieved from combined lidar–radar observations are used for comparison with the simulation results. The simulations show that the observed smoke pollution levels in the upper troposphere were high enough to trigger strong ice nucleation. The simulations also corroborate the hypothesis stated in Part 1 (Ansmann et al., 2025): the persistent smoke layer, continuously observed over the central Arctic during the winter half year 2019–2020, was able to widely suppress homogeneous freezing so that the smoke aerosol most probably controlled cirrus formation and properties. The observations suggest that the INP reservoir was continuously refilled from the lower stratosphere.  Furthermore, the simulations confirm that the observed high ice saturation ratios of 1.3–1.5 over the North Pole region at cirrus tops (with top temperatures of −60 to −75 °C) point to inefficient INPs, as expected when wildfire smoke particles (organic particles) serve as INPs. Finally, the simulations revealed that ice nucleation in widespread and frequently occurring shallow updrafts (with low amplitudes) seems to be responsible for the observed low ICNC values of typically 1–50 crystals L−1 in the Arctic cirrus virga."

After analysis of the chemical composition by means of total carbon determination and high-resolution mass spectrometry, this work highlights the influence of anthropogenic inputs on the chemical composition of both urban and forested areas. 
 In order to study aerosols in environments influenced by anthropogenic and biogenic emissions to variable extents, PM1 samples were collected during summer 2022 in the greater Paris area (ACROSS campaign, Atmospheric Chemistry Of the Suburban Forest, 14 June to 25 July) at two locations that represent the urban Paris and the suburban forested areas. They were analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) together with total carbon (TC) with a thermo-optical method. Both sites are compared here to explore differences in aerosol composition from urban and forested environments. The TC analysis shows similar organic carbon (OC) concentrations at both sites (3.2 ± 1.8 µg m−3 for Paris and 2.9 ± 1.5 µg m−3 for Rambouillet) and higher elemental carbon (EC) values in the urban area. Both OC and EC concentrations did not show significant variations for daytime and nighttime conditions. This work highlights the influence of anthropogenic inputs on the chemical composition of urban and forested areas, derived from the presence of CHO and CHON compounds but also the detection of two sulfur-containing compounds (C5H12SO7 and C10H17NSO7), which could be tentatively assigned as organosulfates. A smaller number of aromatic compounds were observed for clean periods that better represent the local biogenic and anthropogenic contributions in Rambouillet and Paris, respectively."

In this paper, we use the measurements from the Atmospheric Chemistry of the Suburban Forest (ACROSS) campaign, conducted in the Paris area in June–July 2022, along with observations from existing networks, to evaluate a 3D chemistry transport model (WRF–CHIMERE) simulation. Results are shown to be satisfactory, allowing us to explain the gas and aerosol variability at the campaign sites. 
 Understanding the interaction of anthropogenic and biogenic emissions around large urban agglomerations remains an important question for atmospheric research and the key question of the ACROSS (Atmospheric Chemistry of the Suburban Forest) project. ACROSS is based on an intensive field campaign in the Paris area, including ground-based measurements in the urban inner centre and suburban and forested sites and measurements made on board aircraft, during the exceptionally hot and dry summer of 2022. In addition, 3D modelling represents an important tool in ACROSS, and here we use the available measurements from the campaign together with observations from air quality and meteorological networks to evaluate the WRF–CHIMERE model simulation for the ACROSS period. We find that the WRF model is able to reproduce the meteorological variability during the campaign, in particular during two heatwaves. The model reproduces the daily ozone maxima well but overestimates PM2.5 by a factor of 1.5–2, partly due to an overestimation of secondary aerosol, both organic and inorganic. For organic aerosol in the Île-de-France area, the biases are reduced to about ±20 %. These differences are in contrast with those of the existing literature and might have been increased by the hot conditions of summer 2022. For case studies during two heatwave days, the model shows the sources for two organic aerosol peaks above 20–30 µg m−3, on one occasion due to biogenic secondary organic aerosol formation in different forests around Paris and on another occasion due to the advection of wildfire aerosols in combination with secondary formation mainly from forest-emitted biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)."

State-of-the-art instruments and a mobile laboratory were used, and the measurement data were analysed further with modelling tools like positive matrix factorization and the Pollution Detection Algorithm. 
 Physical and chemical properties of particulate matter and concentrations of trace gases were measured at an urban site in Helsinki, Finland, for 5 weeks to investigate the effect of wintertime conditions on pollutants. The measurement took place in a street canyon (traffic supersite) in January–February 2022. In addition, measurements were conducted in an urban background station (UB supersite, SMEAR III, located approx. 0.9 km from the traffic supersite).Measurements were also made using the mobile laboratory. The measurements were made driving the adjacent side streets and the street along the traffic supersite. Source apportionment was performed for the soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer measurements to identify organic factors connected to different particulate sources. Particle number concentration time series and the pollution detection algorithm were used to compare local pollution level differences between the sites.During the campaign three different pollution events were observed with increased pollution concentrations. The increased concentrations during these episodes were due to both trapping of local pollutants near the boundary layer and the long-range and regional transport of pollutants to the Helsinki metropolitan area. Local road vehicle emissions increased the particle number concentrations, especially sub-10 nm particles, and long-range-transported and regionally transported aged particles increased the PM mass and particle size."

In this study we investigate, using an atmospheric chemistry model, how this indirect climate effect differs with different amounts of leakages and with where the hydrogen leaks and if this effect changes in the future. The effect is largest for emissions far from areas where hydrogen is removed from the atmosphere by the soil, but these are not relevant locations for a future hydrogen economy. 
 The use of hydrogen as an energy carrier and reactant in metal production can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by replacing fossil fuel usage. When hydrogen is used, some hydrogen will leak during production, storage, transport, and end use. Via OH-induced reactions in the atmosphere, the hydrogen will enhance methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapour in the atmosphere and hence will increase the radiation imbalance. A recent multi-model study found the global warming potential over a 100-year time horizon (GWP100) for hydrogen to be 11.6±2.8 (1 standard deviation). Here, we use a chemistry transport model to investigate the sensitivity of GWP100 to the magnitude and the location of the hydrogen emission and the chemical composition of the background atmosphere. We show that the hydrogen GWP100 is independent of the size of the emission perturbation; is not dependent on where emissions occur, except for sites far from soil sink active areas; and is not very different for possible future chemical compositions of the atmosphere. The methane GWP100 increases by up to 3.4 for different future atmospheric compositions compared to the present day. Overall, the changes in the hydrogen GWP100 are within 1 standard deviation of the multi-model GWP100, except for emission perturbations at two distant sites not relevant for a future hydrogen economy. Therefore, when assessing emissions at different locations or for a future with a different atmospheric composition compared to the present day, it is not necessary to adjust the multi-model GWP values."

A weak constraint applied when estimating gradients in the GNSS data processing, enhancing short-lived gradient tracking but increasing noise, which can be mitigated by averaging gradients from the eight stations. This approach may enhance GNSS-based atmospheric monitoring for use in weather nowcasting. 
 We  used eight co-located global navigation satellite system (GNSS) stations with different antenna mounts to estimate atmospheric signal propagation delays in the zenith direction and linear horizontal gradients. The gradients are compared with the results from a water vapour radiometer (WVR). The water drops in the atmosphere have a negative influence on the retrieval accuracy of the WVR. Hence, we see better agreement using WVR data with a liquid water content (LWC) less than 0.05 mm compared to when LWC values of up to 0.7 mm are included. We  used two different constraints when estimating the linear gradients from the GNSS data. Using a weak constraint enhances the GNSS estimates to track large gradients of short duration at the cost of increased formal errors. To mitigate random noise in the GNSS gradients, we adopted a fusion approach, averaging estimates from the GNSS stations. This resulted in significant improvements for the agreement with the WVR data, a maximum of 17 % increase in the correlation, and a 14 % reduction in the root mean square (RMS) difference for the east gradients. The corresponding values for the north gradients are both 25 %. Overall, no large differences in terms of quality are observed for the eight GNSS stations. However, one station shows slightly poorer agreement for the north gradients compared to the others. This is attributed to the station's proximity to a radio telescope, which causes data loss of observations at low-elevation angles in the south-south-west direction."

This study uses satellite-derived observations to generate long-term, sustained indices of phytoplankton phenology, capturing the timing, variability, and magnitude of blooms across the global ocean. These indices support the effective monitoring and management of marine resources and help assess the impacts of climate change on ocean ecosystems. 
 Phytoplankton bloom phenology is an important indicator for the monitoring and management of marine resources and the assessment of climate change impacts on ocean ecosystems. Despite its relevance, there is no long-term and sustained observational phytoplankton phenological product available for global-ocean implementation. This need is addressed here by providing a phenological data product (including among other seasonal metrics, the bloom initiation, termination, duration, and amplitude timing) using satellite-derived chlorophyll-a data from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative. This multi-decadal data product provides the phenology output from three widely used bloom detection methods at three different spatial resolutions (4, 9, and 25 km), allowing for both regional- and global-scale applications. When compared to each other on global scales, there is general agreement between the detection methods and between the different resolutions. Regional differences are evident in coastal domains (particularly for different resolutions) and in regions with strong physical–biogeochemical transitions (notably for different detection methods). This product can be used towards the development of national and global biodiversity assessments, for pelagic ecosystem mapping, and for monitoring change in climate sensitive regions relevant for ecosystem services.

A consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists synthesise and update the budget of the sources and sinks of CH4. This edition benefits from important progress in estimating emissions from lakes and ponds, reservoirs, and streams and rivers. For the 2010s decade, global CH4 emissions are estimated at 575 Tg CH4 yr-1, including ~65 % from anthropogenic sources. 
 Understanding and quantifying the global methane (CH4) budget is important for assessing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change. CH4 is the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing after carbon dioxide (CO2), and both emissions and atmospheric concentrations of CH4 have continued to increase since 2007 after a temporary pause. The relative importance of CH4 emissions compared to those of CO2 for temperature change is related to its shorter atmospheric lifetime, stronger radiative effect, and acceleration in atmospheric growth rate over the past decade, the causes of which are still debated. Two major challenges in quantifying the factors responsible for the observed atmospheric growth rate arise from diverse, geographically overlapping CH4 sources and from the uncertain magnitude and temporal change in the destruction of CH4 by short-lived and highly variable hydroxyl radicals (OH). To address these challenges, we have established a consortium of multidisciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to improve, synthesise, and update the global CH4 budget regularly and to stimulate new research on the methane cycle. Following Saunois et al. (2016, 2020), we present here the third version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal CH4 budget, integrating results of top-down CH4 emission estimates (based on in situ and Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) atmospheric observations and an ensemble of atmospheric inverse-model results) and bottom-up estimates (based on process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations). We present a budget for the most recent 2010–2019 calendar decade (the latest period for which full data sets are available), for the previous decade of 2000–2009 and for the year 2020.The revision of the bottom-up budget in this 2025 edition benefits from important progress in estimating inland freshwater emissions, with better counting of emissions from lakes and ponds, reservoirs, and streams and rivers. This budget also reduces double counting across freshwater and wetland emissions and, for the first time, includes an estimate of the potential double counting that may exist (average of 23 Tg CH4 yr−1). Bottom-up approaches show that the combined wetland and inland freshwater emissions average 248 [159–369] Tg CH4 yr−1 for the 2010–2019 decade. Natural fluxes are perturbed by human activities through climate, eutrophication, and land use. In this budget, we also estimate, for the first time, this anthropogenic component contributing to wetland and inland freshwater emissions. Newly available gridded products also allowed us to derive an almost complete latitudinal and regional budget based on bottom-up approaches.For the 2010–2019 decade, global CH4 emissions are estimated by atmospheric inversions (top-down) to be 575 Tg CH4 yr−1 (range 553–586, corresponding to the minimum and maximum estimates of the model ensemble). Of this amount, 369 Tg CH4 yr−1 or ∼ 65 % is attributed to direct anthropogenic sources in the fossil, agriculture, and waste and anthropogenic biomass burning (range 350–391 Tg CH4 yr−1 or 63 %–68 %). For the 2000–2009 period, the atmospheric inversions give a slightly lower total emission than for 2010–2019, by 32 Tg CH4 yr−1 (range 9–40). The 2020 emission rate is the highest of the period and reaches 608 Tg CH4 yr−1 (range 581–627), which is 12 % higher than the average emissions in the 2000s. Since 2012, global direct anthropogenic CH4 emission trends have been tracking scenarios that assume no or minimal climate mitigation policies proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (shared socio-economic pathways SSP5 and SSP3). Bottom-up methods suggest 16 % (94 Tg CH4 yr−1) larger global emissions (669 Tg CH4 yr−1, range 512–849) than top-down inversion methods for the 2010–2019 period. The discrepancy between the bottom-up and the top-down budgets has been greatly reduced compared to the previous differences (167 and 156 Tg CH4 yr−1 in Saunois et al. (2016, 2020) respectively), and for the first time uncertainties in bottom-up and top-down budgets overlap. Although differences have been reduced between inversions and bottom-up, the most important source of uncertainty in the global CH4 budget is still attributable to natural emissions, especially those from wetlands and inland freshwaters.The tropospheric loss of methane, as the main contributor to methane lifetime, has been estimated at 563 [510–663] Tg CH4 yr−1 based on chemistry–climate models. These values are slightly larger than for 2000–2009 due to the impact of the rise in atmospheric methane and remaining large uncertainty (∼ 25 %). The total sink of CH4 is estimated at 633 [507–796] Tg CH4 yr−1 by the bottom-up approaches and at 554 [550–567] Tg CH4 yr−1 by top-down approaches. However, most of the top-down models use the same OH distribution, which introduces less uncertainty to the global budget than is likely justified.For 2010–2019, agriculture and waste contributed an estimated 228 [213–242] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the top-down budget and 211 [195–231] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the bottom-up budget. Fossil fuel emissions contributed 115 [100–124] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the top-down budget and 120 [117–125] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the bottom-up budget. Biomass and biofuel burning contributed 27 [26–27] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the top-down budget and 28 [21–39] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the bottom-up budget.We identify five major priorities for improving the CH4 budget: (i) producing a global, high-resolution map of water-saturated soils and inundated areas emitting CH4 based on a robust classification of different types of emitting ecosystems; (ii) further development of process-based models for inland-water emissions; (iii) intensification of CH4 observations at local (e.g. FLUXNET-CH4 measurements, urban-scale monitoring, satellite imagery with pointing capabilities) to regional scales (surface networks and global remote sensing measurements from satellites) to constrain both bottom-up models and atmospheric inversions; (iv) improvements of transport models and the representation of photochemical sinks in top-down inversions; and (v) integration of 3D variational inversion systems using isotopic and/or co-emitted species such as ethane as well as information in the bottom-up inventories on anthropogenic super-emitters detected by remote sensing (mainly oil and gas sector but also coal, agriculture, and landfills) to improve source partitioning.The data presented here can be downloaded from  https://doi.org/10.18160/GKQ9-2RHT (Martinez et al., 2024)."

By combining field and satellite observations, we provide annual mass changes for all glaciers in the world, showing significant contributions to global sea level rise. This work underscores the need for ongoing local monitoring and global climate action to mitigate the effects of glacier loss and its broader environmental impacts​. 
 Glaciers, distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, play a crucial role in Earth's climate system by affecting global sea levels, regional freshwater availability, nutrient and energy budgets, and local geohazards. Past assessments of regional to global glacier mass changes were limited in spatial coverage, temporal resolution, and/or temporal coverage. Here, we present a new observation-based dataset of glacier mass changes with global coverage and annual resolution from 1976 to 2024. We use geostatistical modeling for the temporal downscaling of decadal glacier-wide elevation change estimates derived from satellite and airborne geodetic data, with glaciological annual in situ observations. In more detail, we spatially interpolate the annual mass balance anomalies from sparse in situ observations and calibrate them to glacier-wide long-term trends from elevation change observations available for individual glaciers for varying time periods and with global glacier coverage from 2000 to 2019. We then extrapolate the results to yearly time series starting between 1915 and 1976, depending on the regional data availability, and extending to 2024. The time series are calculated separately for each of the world's glaciers and then aggregated to gridded (0.5° latitude and longitude), regional, and global estimates of annual glacier mass changes. Since 1976, Earth's glaciers have lost 9179 ± 621 Gt (187 ± 20 Gt per year) of water, contributing 25.3 ± 1.7 mm (0.5 ± 0.2 mm per year) to the global mean sea level rise. About 41 % (∼ 10 mm) of this loss occurred in the last decade, with 6 % (∼ 1.5 mm) occurring in 2023 alone, the record-breaking year of glacier mass loss. We review the strengths and limitations of our new dataset, validate and discuss related uncertainty estimates in a leave-one-out/block-out cross-validation exercise, and compare our results to earlier assessments. The annual mass change time series for individual glaciers and the derived global gridded annual mass change product are available from the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) at https://doi.org/10.5904/wgms-amce-2025-02 (Dussaillant et al., 2025)."

Here we present a daily 1 km shortwave albedo product for Antarctic sea ice from 2012 to 2021, based on VIIRS reflectance data. Additionally, we reconstructed the albedo for missing pixels due to cloud cover. This dataset can be used to assess changes in Antarctic sea ice, radiation budget, and the strength of sea ice albedo feedback mechanisms, as well as their potential interconnections. 
 Sea ice albedo is a critical parameter for quantifying the energy budget in the Antarctic region. High spatiotemporal resolution sea ice albedo product is essential for Antarctic climate and environmental research. In this study, based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) reflectance data, we use the Multiband Reflectance Iteration (MBRI) algorithm to calculate sea ice albedo. This algorithm fully utilizes multi-band observations from single-angle/date observed information to correct the anisotropy of the sea ice surface. Additionally, spatiotemporal information is utilized to reconstruct albedo under cloudy-sky conditions, while correcting for cloud radiative forcing effects. A new daily seamless Antarctic sea ice albedo product with a 1 km resolution is then generated for the period 2012 to 2021. Monte Carlo simulations show that the average retrieval uncertainty of this product is 0.022, with higher uncertainty in backward observations. MBRI albedo product was validated using in situ measurements from Automatic Weather Stations (AWS). The results show that the bias is 0.02, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.071. After upscaling to 25 km resolution and applying a 5-day temporal aggregation, the RMSE decreased to below 0.055. Compared to existing albedo products, the MBRI product exhibits improved spatial continuity due to the reconstruction of cloudy-sky pixels. Statistical analysis shows that albedo under cloudy-sky conditions is higher than under clear-sky conditions (mean difference: 0.035–0.064). The MBRI albedo product can be used to estimate sea ice albedo feedback, energy balance analysis and sea ice monitoring.

The model is trained on 3.7 million measurements globally available and provides skilful estimates across all regions. This advancement will help in better assessing future sea level changes and freshwater resources, with significance for both the scientific community and society at large. 
 Knowledge of glacier ice volumes is crucial for constraining future sea level potential, evaluating freshwater resources, and assessing impacts on societies, from regional to global. Motivated by the disparity in existing ice volume estimates, we present IceBoost, a global machine learning framework trained to predict ice thickness at arbitrary coordinates, thereby enabling the generation of spatially distributed thickness maps for individual glaciers. IceBoost is an ensemble of two gradient-boosted trees trained with 3.7 million globally available ice thickness measurements and an array of 39 numerical features. The model error is similar to those of existing models outside polar regions and is up to 30 %–40 % lower at high latitudes. Providing supervision by exposing the model to available glacier thickness measurements reduces the error by a factor of up to 2 to 3. A feature-ranking analysis reveals that geodetic data are the most informative variables, while ice velocity can improve the model performance by 6 % at high latitudes. A major feature of IceBoost is a capability to generalize outside the training domain, i.e. producing meaningful ice thickness maps in all regions of the world, including on the ice sheet peripheries."

This study explores the potential of flexible carbon source regulation to reduce GHG emissions while improving the nutrient removal efficiency under varying influent conditions. A plant-wide model was developed, calibrated with one year of hourly monitoring data, to quantify GHG emissions in a full-scale WWTP. We evaluated three carbon regulation strategies: anaerobic digestion (AD), short fermentation (SF), and adaptive carbon source regulation (ACSR). Results show that AD was most effective in high carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios, reducing GHG emissions by 29.2%. SF performed best at low C/N ratios, reducing N2O emissions by 56.3%. The ACSR strategy, which dynamically adjusts between AD and SF based on influent C/N, achieved a total GHG reduction of 18.2% compared with the base strategy (conventional activated sludge process with mechanical dewatering and landfill disposal of waste sludge). Seasonal variations significantly impacted emissions (p < 0.001), while C/N ratios, although not statistically significant in isolation, play a crucial role in influencing N2O emissions and sludge production, emphasizing the need for adaptive carbon allocation.

According to Köhler theory, aerosol activation into cloud droplets or CCN activity is impacted by aerosol surface tension. However, predicting the surface tension of activating aerosol particles is complicated by the bulk depletion of surfactants, which is sensitive to droplet size. Here, we present a simple surface-bulk partitioning model based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which is capable of predicting bulk depletion and the size-dependent surface tension of microscopic droplets. The present model is validated by comparing our predictions with reported surface tension measurements of microdroplets containing nonionic surfactants and generally agrees with the droplet measurements. More importantly, the model can reproduce the size-dependent surface tension of ∼5–20 μm droplets containing NaCl and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at a given SDS concentration. Predicted Köhler curves of equilibrium supersaturation versus droplet diameter reveal that the models assuming a constant surface tension of pure water (i.e., classical Köhler theory) or bulk solution containing surfactants may potentially underestimate or overestimate CCN activity, respectively, highlighting the essential role of size-dependent surface tension in accurately representing the effect of surface tension on aerosol-cloud interactions."

Thus, a sequential convolutional long short-term memory network framework (CNN-LSTM) was designed to utilize the STRMFs for ozone prediction. Scenarios incorporating STRMFs across multiple spatiotemporal scales were constructed using Global Forecast System (GFS) data sets. Model performance was evaluated in terms of ozone concentration prediction accuracy (AOCP) and precision in forecasting high-ozone pollution events (PHOE) across key Chinese regions. Appropriate expansion of meteorological data spatiotemporal scale enhanced AOCP, with notable improvements in PHOE, demonstrating ozone variability’s dependence on multiscale meteorological processes. Leveraging meteorological data that better represent real atmospheric conditions improved AOCP. The CNN-LSTM framework explained over 85% of daily ozone variability through STRMF integration, successfully resolving how ozone concentration variations in key regions responded to typhoon positional shifts.

These events resulted in a 40–80% increase in PM deposition in the respiratory systems for occupants in the living room, especially fine particles depositing in the alveolar region. Evidence indicates that these pollutant events originated from cooking fume transport. The geometric mean diameter of kitchen particles decreased from 76 nm during background periods to 62 nm during transport events, consistent with smaller PM from cooking activities. Furthermore, 30 cooking-related VOCs were identified as transport indicators, including hazardous species such as aldehydes. We confirmed that leakage of cooking fume through the shared kitchen exhaust duct led to cross-contamination, which can be effectively mitigated by using exhaust hoods, air cleaners, or opening windows during mealtimes.

One passive sampling design successfully employed for other, well studied contaminants (e.g., methylmercury) is the diffusive gradient in thin film sampler (DGT). However, the application of DGT for PFAS requires development and validation. Here, we iterate on previous PFAS-DGT studies by introducing a redesigned diffusive gradient sampler for PFAS in water and show that it reliably measures 25 PFAS in water, consistent with diffusion theory. Diffusion and whole-sampler uptake rates consistently agreed with model predictions within ±50% relative difference, including when tested at cold temperature (5 °C). In field and laboratory deployments, DGT samplers measured PFAS concentrations within ±23% of grab sample results on average in each case─better performance than codeployed microporous polyethylene tube passive samplers.

During MOSAiC, we collected multi‐dimensional aerial data to examine the relationship between pre‐melt surface topography and melt pond evolution across an entire Arctic ice floe. Using hydrological models, we analyze the correlation between potential meltwater accumulation areas identified in winter and spring topographies, available meltwater, and observed pond coverage. Our findings demonstrate a strong connection, revealing a 72% accuracy in matching low areas to melt ponds, with 98% of basins deeper than 0.5 m transforming into ponds.

At the pentad timescale, each ISO mode tends to suppress the occurrence of the other two. The diagnostic of column‐integrated moist static energy (MSE) tendency anomalies reveals the dominant contribution from horizontal MSE advection to each ISO mode.

The distinct subsurface changes induce strengthened Pacific oceanic stratification to enhance Bjerknes feedback, in contrast to an insignificant change in the Atlantic. Moreover, the similar surface changes exert different impacts, with a strengthened atmospheric stratification suppressing the Atlantic Bjerknes feedback, an influence offset in the Pacific by an eastward shift of deep convection due to Niño‐like SST warming. Such offset is absent in the Atlantic owing to the northern‐hemisphere‐located deep convection."

In rivers with hydraulically steep local slopes greater than ∼ ${\sim} $0.01, flow velocities are high and the Froude number Fr $Fr$ (ratio of inertial to gravitational forces) can approach 1.0 (critical flow) or greater. Under these conditions, undular hydraulic jumps (UHJ's) can form as standing wave trains at slope transitions or constrictions.

However, their combined influence on storm tracks remains to be determined. To answer this question, we defined four phases to represent the different combinations of large‐scale SSTA patterns in the North Pacific and mesoscale SSTA in Kuroshio and Oyashio confluence region (KOCR), based on the standardized mesoscale SSTA index and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) index. The storm tracks' response mainly exhibits a significant meridional dipolar structure in all phases, primarily driven by the mesoscale SSTA and consistent with previous studies. However, the details of the reaction differ under the modulation of PDO. Our findings also suggest the role of PDO is more pronounced when the variation of mesoscale SSTA is strong. Additionally, the storm tracks show more elongated and asymmetric anomalies in the warm PDO phase than the cold PDO phase. The key mechanism behind this is as follows. It revealed that the baroclinic processes associated with mesoscale SSTA are important in shaping storm tracks. The variation of mesoscale SSTA in KOCR changes the upward transportation of moisture and heat, which may alter diabatic heating. Consequently, differences emerge in the meridional gradient of air temperature, modifying the baroclinicity of the troposphere. Through baroclinic energy conversion, the influence finally impacts the storm tracks. PDO totally modulates these processes. In conclusion, the development of the North Pacific storm tracks are influenced by the combined effects of large‐scale and mesoscale SSTA."

Chasteen,Resolving Mesoscale Convective Systems: Grid Spacing Sensitivity in the Tropics and Midlatitudes,"Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are a critical global water cycle component and drive extreme precipitation events in tropical and midlatitude regions. However, simulating deep convection remains challenging for modern numerical weather and climate models due to the complex interactions of processes from microscales to synoptic scales. Recent models with kilometer‐scale horizontal grid spacings (Δx) $({\Delta }x)$ offer notable improvements in simulating deep convection compared to coarser‐resolution models. Still, deficiencies in representing key physical processes, such as entrainment, lead to systematic biases. Additionally, evaluating model outputs using process‐oriented observational data remain difficult. This study presents an ensemble of MCS simulations with Δx ${\Delta }x$ spanning the deep convective gray zone (Δx ${\Delta }x$ from 12 km to 125 m) in the Southern Great Plains of the U.S. and the Amazon Basin. Comparing these simulations with Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) wind profiler observations, we find greater Δx ${\Delta }x$ sensitivity in the Amazon Basin compared to the Great Plains. Convective drafts converge structurally at sub‐kilometer scales, but some deficiencies remain. In both regions, simulated up and downdrafts are too deep and extreme downdrafts are not strong enough. Furthermore, Amazonian updrafts are too strong. Overall, we observe higher Δx ${\Delta }x$ sensitivity in the tropics, including an artificial buildup in vertical kinetic energy at scales of 5Δx $5{\Delta }x$, suggesting a need for Δx≤ ${\Delta }x\le $ 250 m in this region. Nevertheless, bulk convergence—agreement of storm‐average statistics—is achievable with kilometer‐scale simulations within a ± $\pm $10% error margin with Δx= ${\Delta }x=$ 1 km providing a good balance between accuracy and computational cost."

Using the observation‐based model (OBM) constrained by vertical profiles, we identified that the aerosol radiation effect (ARE) has a stronger impact on photochemical characteristics and O3‐NOx‐VOC sensitivity than the VOCs reactivity effect (VRE). ARE is the dominant factor, promoting the formation of O3 and ·OH (increases by 36.7% and 106.3%), enhancing high‐altitude oxidation, and shifting parts of the VOC‐limited regimes to the NOx‐limited regimes (VOCs/NOx ratio decreases by 21.1%). Additionally, rapid NOx depletion with altitude leads to stronger NOx limitation aloft, amplifying ARE's effect on O3‐NOx‐VOC sensitivity (ratio decreases by 28.1%).

 Dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis plays a pivotal role in the accelerated degradation of cartilage, presenting a notable challenge for effective osteoarthritis (OA) treatment and cartilage regeneration. In this study, we introduced an injectable hydrogel based on streamlined-zinc oxide (ZnO), which is responsive to matrix metallopeptidase (MMP), for the delivery of miR-17-5p. This approach aimed to address cartilage damage by regulating ECM homeostasis. The ZnO/miR-17-5p composite functions by releasing zinc ions to attract native bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, thereby fostering ECM synthesis through the proliferation of new chondrocytes. Concurrently, sustained delivery of miR-17-5p targets enzymes responsible for matrix degradation, thereby mitigating the catabolic process. Notably, the unique structure of the streamlined ZnO nanoparticles is distinct from their conventional spherical counterparts, which not only optimizes the rheological and mechanical properties of the hydrogels, but also enhances the efficiency of miR-17-5p transfection. Our male rat model demonstrated that the combination of streamlined ZnO, MMP-responsive hydrogels, and miRNA-based therapy effectively managed the equilibrium between catabolism and anabolism within the ECM, presenting a fresh perspective in the realm of OA treatment.

 Biophysical signals such as motion and optically acquired hemodynamics represent foundational sensing modalities for wearables. Expansion of this toolset is vital for the progression of digital medicine. Current efforts utilize biofluids such as sweat and interstitial fluid with primarily adhesively mounted sensors that are fundamentally limited by epidermal turnover. A class of potential biomarkers that is largely unexplored are gaseous emissions from the body. In this work, we introduce an approach to capture emission of gas from the skin with a leaky cavity designed to allow for diffusion-based ambient gas exchange with the environment. This approach, coupled with differential measurement of ambient and in-cavity gas concentrations, allows for the real-time analysis of sweat rate, VOCs, and CO2 while performing everyday tasks. The resulting biosignals are recorded with temporal resolutions that exceed current methodology, providing unparalleled insight into physiological processes without requiring sensor replacement over weeks at a time. Acquiring biomarkers from blood or sweat is limited by invasiveness or biofouling. Skin gas emissions bypass these issues, offering rich biosignals.

 The discovery of bifunctional degradation activating compounds (BiDACs) has led to the development of a new class of drugs that promote the clearance of their protein targets. BiDAC-induced ubiquitination is generally believed to direct cytosolic and nuclear proteins to proteolytic destruction by proteasomes. However, pathways that govern the degradation of other classes of BiDAC targets, such as integral membrane and intraorganellar proteins, have not been investigated in depth. In this study we use morphological profiling and CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screens to investigate the mechanisms by which BiDACs induce the degradation of plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) EGFR and Her2. We find that BiDAC-dependent ubiquitination triggers the trafficking of RTKs from the plasma membrane to lysosomes for degradation. Notably, functional proteasomes are required for endocytosis of RTKs upstream of the lysosome. Additionally, our screen uncovers a non-canonical function of the lysosome-associated arginine/lysine transporter PQLC2 in EGFR degradation. Our data show that BiDACs can target proteins to proteolytic machinery other than the proteasome and motivate further investigation of mechanisms that govern the degradation of diverse classes of BiDAC targets. In this study authors use morphological profiling and CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screens to investigate the mechanisms by which BiDACs induce the degradation of plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) EGFR and Her2."

Here, the authors develop an assay directly coupling protein ligand binding to the luminescence intensity of NanoLuc luciferase; enabling a compound discovery strategy for a broad spectrum of potential drug targets. 
 Drug design strategies represent a fundamental challenge in chemical biology that could benefit from the development of next-generation high-throughput assays. Here we demonstrate that structural dynamic changes induced by ligand binding can be transmitted to a sensor protein fused to a target protein terminus. Here, NanoLuc luciferase, used as the intact protein or its α-complementation peptide, was fused to seven proteins from distinct enzyme superfamilies resulting in sensitive ligand-dependent bioluminescent outputs. This finding allows a general non-competitive, function-independent, quantitative, isothermal gain-of-signal ligand binding readout. As applied to chemical library high throughput screening, we can observe multivariate pharmacologic outputs including cofactor-induced synergy in ligand binding, as well as an example of allosteric site binding. The structural dynamics response assay format described here can enable the investigation of proteins precluded from study due to cost-prohibitive, insensitive, or technically challenging assays, including from cell lysates containing endogenously expressed gene edited proteins.

Here, the authors demonstrate that such bones grow through a mechanical feedback mechanism that propagates a wave of differentiation and emergent cell motion. 
 Cellular motion is a key feature of tissue morphogenesis and is often driven by migration. However, migration need not explain cell motion in contexts where there is little free space or no obvious substrate, such as those found during organogenesis of mesenchymal organs including the embryonic skull. Through ex vivo imaging, biophysical modeling, and perturbation experiments, we find that mechanical feedback between cell fate and stiffness drives bone expansion and controls bone size in vivo. This mechanical feedback system is sufficient to propagate a wave of differentiation that establishes a collagen gradient which we find sufficient to describe patterns of osteoblast motion. Our work provides a mechanism for coordinated motion that may not rely upon cell migration but on emergent properties of the mesenchymal collective. Identification of such alternative mechanisms of mechanochemical coupling between differentiation and morphogenesis will help in understanding how directed cellular motility arises in complex environments with inhomogeneous material properties. How the bones of the skull vault expand to cover the brain is poorly understood. Here, the authors demonstrate that such bones grow through a mechanical feedback mechanism that propagates a wave of differentiation and emergent cell motion."

 Land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) can influence precipitation via changes in surface energy, water flux, and large-scale atmospheric circulation, with great implications for the sustainable development of nature and society. However, the impacts and mechanisms of these contributors to extreme precipitation changes compared with mean changes still need to be investigated. Here, we used the moisture budget equation to decompose precipitation changes into three primary contributing factors (evapotranspiration, atmospheric mean circulation, and water vapor) based on CMIP6-LUMIP experiments. A global reduction in mean precipitation due to LULCCs can be attributed to relatively equal contributions of changes in evapotranspiration and atmospheric mean circulation over the historical (1995–2014) and future (2080–2099) periods. In contrast, during the top drying month, the precipitation reduction is approximately 2–3 times greater than the multi-year mean change. The dynamic contributor representing the mean circulation change surpasses evapotranspiration as the primary contributor driving the extreme precipitation decrease in the majority of the landscape. The socioeconomic impacts of LULCCs-induced extreme precipitation changes are greater than those of the mean state, especially in the future."

Integrating fire-smart fuels management with bioenergy could reduce wildfire risk while providing feedstock for bioenergy. We explore this strategy in off-grid communities in Canada who are heavily dependent on diesel for their energy needs, many of which are home to Indigenous peoples. Combining national remote sensing data and community-based information, we identify 33 diesel-dependent communities at high wildfire risk due to a large accumulation of undisturbed flammable forest.

 Extreme heat is a global public health concern that is becoming more frequent and severe in recent periods. Translating Earth science data into policy-relevant metrics, such as rest breaks, is challenging but needed to protect outdoor workers from heat stress. Here, we determine rest-break requirements for the farmworkers of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys in southern California, which have a high poverty rate and the highest heat-illness rates in California. We used high-resolution outputs from a validated Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) at 1-km grid resolution that includes irrigation, a key modulator of heat stress in the study region. We calculated exceedances of heat stress indicators under three existing policy guidelines that use wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), heat index (HI), or dry-bulb temperature (DBT), and translated them into rest breaks needed for farmworker safety. WBGT-based rest minutes are most sensitive to the spatiotemporal variation in heat exposure compared to DBT or HI and vary with acclimatization status, season, and work shifts. Recommended rest breaks to protect farmworkers from heat stress range from 2 to 32 min per work-hour between April and August. Although results are specific to California, our method is adaptable for calculating region-specific rest break requirements worldwide.

 The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission, launched to the International Space Station on June 29, 2018, currently provides high spatial resolution thermal observations in five bands with a revisit time of 1–5 days. The ECO2LSTE product, which provides the land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity (LSE) retrieved using the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm, serves as an essential ECOSTRESS product for generating the other higher-level products such as evapotranspiration and water use efficiency. Considering the radiometric calibration issues identified in the ECOSTRESS Collection 1 (C1) radiance data, recently the Collection 2 (C2) products have been released to address the cold bias in LST estimates below 300 K. Additionally, following the restoration of the two bands centered at 8.29 and 9.20 μm, the ECOSTRESS TES algorithm was shifted from 3-band to 5-band after May 2023. Consequently, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to have a better understanding how LST&E estimates from different collections and algorithms perform. In this study, the impact of radiometric recalibration on LST&E estimates was first investigated for both the 3-band and 5-band TES algorithms based on a representative simulation dataset. Subsequently, we evaluated the accuracy of ECOSTRESS LST&E estimates in both collections using globally distributed ground measurements, and a spatial comparison between the C1 and C2 LST estimates was conducted over three selected regions to investigate their discrepancies of temperature spatial distribution. The simulation analysis revealed that the C2 LST was marginally lower than the C1 LST above 320 K but became higher below 320 K, with significant overestimation observed below 270 K. For LSE, the C2 estimates were generally lower than those in C1, particularly in the first three bands. Compared to the 3-band TES, larger differences between the C1 and C2 LST&E estimates were found for the 5-band TES. Based on the site-scale evaluation of LST, the cold bias between 270 and 300 K was effectively corrected in C2, with the bias in this range significantly reduced from approximately −2 K to 0. However, an overestimation exceeding 2 K was found for the C2 LST below 270 K, which may be caused by the overcorrection at low temperatures. LST estimates from both collections performed similarly above 300 K, with a systematically overestimation about 1 K. The spatial evaluation of LST reaffirms the findings from the simulation analysis and site-scale evaluation regarding the differences between C1 and C2 LST estimates. In the site-scale evaluation of LSE, a minor improvement was achieved in C2 over non-gray bodies, but the accuracy decreased over gray bodies. The LSE estimates using the 3-band and 5-band TES algorithms were comparable. Overall, this study provides updated information on the accuracies and differences of ECOSTRESS LST&E estimates from both collections, promoting the informed use of ECO2LSTE products in various downstream research applications with a clearer understanding of their performance."

 Rock glaciers (RGs) are ice and debris landforms shaped by long-term permafrost creep. Their inventory has expanded significantly in the past two decades due to their importance as water resources and indicators of climate change. Previous inventories in the Pyrenees are sparse and lack essential kinematic data, leading to an underestimation of active RGs. This study presents the first kinematic database of Pyrenean RGs, integrating European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) InSAR data with airborne Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets and seven years of Sentinel-1 high-resolution InSAR data processed by the SqueeSAR algorithm. The analysis focuses on three igneous plutons (Panticosa, Cauterets, and Neouvielle) in the central Pyrenees, comparing surface displacement rates from these techniques to previous geodetic measurements. A total of 733 RGs have been mapped in the Pyrenees, covering an area of 58.9 km2. 73 % of the mapped RGs are inactive or relict, showing no ground displacement and being partially vegetated. Only 13 % (96 RGs) remain active, covering less than 10 km2, and are primarily north-facing. An additional 14 % (102 RGs) lack InSAR data but they are considered potentially active based on their orientation, altitude, and remarkable morphological features. The existence of active RGs at relatively low altitudes lowers the permafrost boundary between 2100 and 2600 m on north- and south-facing slopes, respectively. Despite the limitations of InSAR to measure displacements along the north-south axis and the fact that most active RGS are oriented to the north, according to the decomposition of the LOS displacement to vertical and horizontal components and LiDAR data, the ongoing subsidence and decline in horizontal movement related to ice degradation suggest a transition of many RGs from active to relict, marking rapid permafrost degradation. Finally, the EGMS has proven inadequate for detecting slow-moving active RGs in the Pyrenees due to temporal decorrelation caused by prolonged snow cover periods, particularly when compared to the combined use of SqueeSAR and airborne LiDAR datasets. The EGMS detected ground information for only 14 out of 89 active RGs, provided inaccurate kinematic data and underestimated the decomposed vertical and horizontal velocities by up to fourfold."

 Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is a key indicator of photosynthetic activity and primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. While moderate-coarse spatial resolution FAPAR products have enabled global vegetation studies, their pixel sizes smooth fine-scale heterogeneity and limit applications needing a detailed spatial characterization. Landsat provides multispectral data at 30 m spatial resolution enabling global and long-term FAPAR estimation at finer spatial detail. But challenges exist in deriving continuous Landsat FAPAR time series due to infrequent clear observations. We propose here a generic two-step method to produce gap-free Landsat FAPAR time series. First, in clear-sky conditions, FAPAR is retrieved from Landsat surface reflectance observations using a random forest (RF) regression model previously trained with the Global land surface satellite (GLASS) V6 FAPAR product. In a second step, a novel Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Network with Sparrow Search Algorithm and Attention mechanism (SSA-BiTCN-Attention) was used to reconstruct the missing FAPAR values. The temporal information of Landsat clear-sky FAPAR within a five-year window was used for predicting the missing values. The reconstruction model accurately predicted missing FAPAR values across different land cover types with RMSE ranging from 0.08 to 0.12. The validation results showed a good agreement between the estimated Landsat FAPAR and ground measurements from VAlidation of Land European Remote Sensing Instruments (VALERI), ImagineS and Ground Based Observations for Validation (GBOV), with R2 values ranging from 0.82 to 0.92, RMSE values from 0.10 to 0.12, and bias values from 0.02 to 0.05. The Landsat retrievals are consistent with GLASS and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FAPAR products and improve these two products in terms of accuracy and spatial resolution. As a demonstration case study, we applied our method to generate 30-m, 16-day FAPAR time series from 2013 to 2023 over China. The Landsat gap-free FAPAR product exhibits seamless spatial coverage and temporal continuity across China. This innovative method has the potential to be applied to multiple satellite data and land surface products to generate gap-free high spatio-temporal time series of land surface variables at the global scale, which will contribute in improving environmental modeling, carbon cycling studies, and agricultural applications."

 Using satellite radar interferometry, we investigate surface deformation in the Great Aletsch Glacier region from 2015 to 2021. By applying a statistical blind source separation method on displacement timeseries, our study reveals irreversible trends near large slope instabilities, potentially indicating slope responses to the glacier’s retreat. Moreover, annual cyclic deformation indicates significant pore pressure variations in fractured bedrock slopes resulting from groundwater storage and discharge processes. These spatial variations, assessed with satellite radars, reflect changes in pore pressure and rock mass hydromechanical properties, aligning with continuous ground monitoring data. This study demonstrates the potential of using satellite interferometry to investigate slope-scale mechanical processes driven by seasonal to multiannual environmental factors in complex alpine regions. It is the first timeseries synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) study in a paraglacial environment validated by spatially distributed, high-resolution ground monitoring data. Moreover, it shows the advantages of the TS-InSAR high spatial coverage and its capacity to complement ground monitoring during data interruptions at ground stations.

 Biomass burning is a significant source of atmospheric pollution. While existing studies have largely focused on the comprehensive analysis of biomass burning particulate matter (PM), the variations in particle size, morphology, and mixing characteristics under different burning conditions remain to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we collected PM emitted from poplar wood burning in a quartz tube furnace at three different ignition temperatures (400, 600, and 800 °C), aiming to analyze the chemical composition and single-particle characteristics of PM under varying ignition temperatures. OC/EC analysis revealed that the OC emission factor at 400 °C (35.05 ± 2.11 g/kg) was an order of magnitude higher than those at 600 °C (1.00 ± 0.21 g/kg) and 800 °C (1.57 ± 0.93 g/kg), while the EC emission factor increased by an order of magnitude with rising temperature, from 0.41 ± 0.03 g/kg at 400 °C to 4.03 ± 0.94 g/kg at 800 °C. Further observation under TEM-EDS showed that carbonaceous particles were the predominant components of PM emitted from poplar wood burning at all temperatures. At 400 °C, over 95 % of the particles were primarily amorphous organic matter, with only a small number of EC particles formed. At 600 °C, 72.6 % of the emitted particles were aggregated black carbon particles, 17.5 % were tar-balls, and the remaining 9.9 % were monomeric organic matter particles with extremely small particle sizes. At 800 °C, 93.8 % of the particles were two types of black carbon particles with varying monomer particle sizes and nearly bare surfaces. Our experimental results indicate that burning temperature is a crucial factor leading to differences in the composition, morphology, and elemental composition of biomass-emitted particles. Furthermore, they serve as a reminder that the significant variations caused by different burning temperatures should be considered when estimating biomass burning, especially the increasingly widespread wildfire burning."

 The European summer of 2022 was exceptionally warm in the historical record (since mid-19th century). We show that it was a record-breaking summer at European scales since at least 1500 due to three large-scale atmospheric heatwaves, all concurring with a prolonged dry period over Europe and an intense marine heatwave over the Mediterranean. We evaluate the role of dynamical (atmospheric circulation) and thermodynamical (regional soil moisture and western Mediterranean sea surface temperatures) drivers. Flow analogues of the June 2022 heatwave are used to reconstruct the expected temperatures under different combinations of these thermodynamical drivers and assess their separate and combined influences on the intensity of the event. Results show a measurable intensification of the heatwave event (of ∼1 °C) by both dry land and warm sea conditions.

 The motivation of this research is to contribute to the knowledge about the relationship between the occurrence of lightning and hydrometeors present in storms, through polarimetric observations with meteorological radar and the application of the semi-supervised methodology of Besic et al. (2016) for the classification of hydrometeors. The objective is to develop a linear regression equation that correlates the mass of hydrometeors with the lightning rate, through the lightning provided by the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network, commonly known as ENTLN, for part of the southeastern region of Brazil. For this, the Z-M relationship between the radar reflectivity and the amount of hydrometeor mass present in the radar volume was used to compare it with the lightning density rate. During the period from 2019 to 2022, it was observed that the reported hail precipitation events coincide with the precipitable graupel indicated through the classification of hydrometeors algorithm. In these events, the trend of ice mass over the hours was similar to that of the observed lightning. The results show a significant correlation between these two parameters for different regions with distinct land cover, urbanization and topography, including ocean. Demonstrating that it is possible to develop empirical equations to relate ice mass to lightning density rates.

 From 2019 to 2022, there were a total of 34 sea fog events in the Bohai Sea, among which sea land breezes (SLB) occurred 17 times (accounting for 50 %). The duration of fog in the presence of SLB ranged from 24 to 40 h, while fog without SLB lasted between 3 and 7 h. The SLB circulation significantly increased the duration of sea fog. Therefore it's necessity to study the impacts of SLB on fog formation and dissipation of the Bohai Sea. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model could simulate meteorological elements well, showing good reliability. Sensitivity experiments were carried out using the WRF model on two different types of SLB-fog. The numeral simulation results are showed as follows. Under the influence of land breeze, the vertical cloud liquid water (CLW) content increased 0.016–0.7 g kg−1, the height of the boundary layer reduced 66.7 % ∼ 92.3 %, and temperature inversion layer was formed 0.5 km in the coastal and offshore areas of the Bohai Sea. Thus the sea fog was formed and the coastal fog intensity was enhanced affected by the land breeze. Under the influence of sea breeze, the height of the boundary layer increased 0.5–7 times and the temperature inversion layer disappeared or weakened in coastal cities. The influence of sea breeze on the transportation of CLW content was decreased 0.016–0.358 g kg−1. Under the combined influence of factors such as CLW, temperature inversion, and boundary layer height, the sea breeze caused large-scale dissipation of sea fog in the Bohai Sea or hindered the expansion of the fog area. Numeral simulation of a typical case indicated that the increased CLW content (0.016–0.07 g kg−1) under the influence of land breeze led to the formation of this sea fog. The intensity of the land breeze influenced the size of the fog area. In the near-surface layer of A Platform, the Richardson number (Ri) decreased 0.2–7.2 when affected by the sea breeze, which was conducive to the development of turbulence. The CLW content decreased by up to 0.71 g kg−1. Therefore, the sea fog dissipated over a large area in the Bohai Sea under the influence of sea breeze. These findings suggest that the mesoscale circulation of SLB played an important role when the large-scale meteorological conditions were relatively weak."

 Lightning development involves transient events that produce non-stationary, abrupt changes in lightning structure. The most prominent (and most studied) examples of reactivation of lightning side branches are recoil leaders that are initiated near the tips of previously decayed positive leader channels. This study proposes a numerical model that, among other things, takes into account evolution of channel temperature profile and is aimed at simulation the recoil leader inception. The model is based on the paradigm of reversal point meandering, which is a consequence of the macroscale asymmetry of development of positive and negative lightning poles. Simulation results allow one for the first time to formulate a physically-based and well-founded mechanism of a negative recoil leader initiation. In particular, it is shown that the channel reactivation is provided by the wave of electric field that starts from the branching point and propagates along a previously decayed (but still heated) leader channel when its per-unit-length resistance does not exceed several thousand Ohms per meter. This resistance corresponds to the channel temperature no less than ∼3500 K under equilibrium conditions. It is shown that channel reactivation starts somewhere between the branching point and the previously decayed leader tip, in agreement with observations. Additionally, the plasma chemical aspects of the leader channel reactivation are discussed."

 Understanding the variability of wet and dry spells in the West African Monsoon (WAM) is essential for improving climate prediction and resource management. Using in situ daily rainfall observations from five stations located within the Guinea Coast having at least 99.5 % data record and pass quality control checks. This study examines the characteristics, atmospheric precursors, and large-scale circulation patterns associated with wet and dry spells during the summer monsoon season (1982–2020). Results reveal significant spatial variability, with Port Harcourt recording the highest wet spell frequency (>5 %), longest duration (53.38 days), and largest rainfall contribution (35.83 %). In contrast, Tabligbo experiences the highest dry spell frequency (10.92 %) and longest duration (76.23 days), contributing only 0.46 % to total monsoonal rainfall due to its location in the Dahomey Gap. Composite analysis of 841 wet and 2188 dry spell days shows a dipole-like structure, where wet spells are linked to enhanced southwesterly winds, cyclonic circulation, and increased moisture transport over the Guinea Coast, while dry spells exhibit anomalous westerlies, moisture divergence, and reduced convection. Lead-lag analysis from five days before to six days after spell onset reveals that wet spells are preceded by easterly anomalies at 850 hPa, followed by strengthening southwesterlies at onset, which peak after the onset before weakening. In contrast, dry spells develop under enhanced westerlies, inhibiting convection before onset, with intensified easterlies exporting moisture offshore from the onset. Vertical wind structures further show that wet spells weaken the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) while strengthening the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), favoring deep convection, whereas dry spells is associated with deeper and stronger moisture depth that suppress convective development. These findings highlight the role of large-scale circulation in modulating regional wet and dry spells, emphasizing the need for long-term coordinated regional observations to improve monsoon forecasting, climate adaptation, and water resource management."

 Temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have been increasing over the past 50 years, with the warming trend accelerating from +0.16 °C/decade between the mid-1980s and 1990s to +0.36 °C/decade from 2000 to 2022. However, the elevation-dependent warming (EDW) on the TP remains controversial, and the driving mechanisms are poorly understood. Utilizing the ERA5-Land dataset, we investigate EDW patterns across both the Endorheic and Exorheic basins on the TP, focusing on cloud cover characteristics and quantifying the influences of clouds at different levels on EDW through the Random Forest analysis. Our findings reveal distinct EDW patterns, with more pronounced warming occurring at night. Between 2000 and 2022, changes in cloud cover, particularly the increase in high cloud cover at night and middle cloud cover during the day, played a crucial role in modulating temperature trends. The effect of diurnal net cloud radiative forcing (CRF) from 1984 to 2022 is characterized by daytime heating in the western TP, cooling in the eastern TP, and uniform nighttime warming across the TP. The reduction in middle and high cloud cover from 1984 to 2000 was associated with overall warming, while from 2000 to 2022, albedo diminished from middle clouds and increased longwave radiation from high clouds contributed to continued warming, particularly at higher elevations. These findings highlight the role of CRF in amplifying EDW and emphasize the significance of cloud radiative processes in driving regional warming.

PINK1 is activated by mitochondrial damage to phosphorylate ubiquitin and Parkin, triggering mitophagy. PINK1 also indirectly phosphorylates Rab GTPases, such as Rab8A. Using an siRNA library targeting human Ser/Thr kinases in HeLa cells, we identified EIF2AK1 [heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase], a branch of the integrated stress response (ISR), as a negative regulator of PINK1. EIF2AK1 knockdown enhances mitochondrial depolarization–induced PINK1 stabilization and phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Rab8A. These results were confirmed in SK-OV-3, U2OS, and ARPE-19 cells. Knockdown of DELE1, an activator of EIF2AK1, produced similar effects. Notably, the ISR inhibitor ISRIB also enhanced PINK1 activation. In human cells with mito-QC mitophagy reporters, EIF2AK1 knockdown or ISRIB treatment increased PINK1-dependent mitophagy without affecting deferiprone-induced mitophagy.

As compared to the single-channel offset pinhole and two-channel split-detector nonconfocal AOSLO designs, by providing multidirectional imaging capabilities, a recent generation of multidetector and (multi-)offset aperture AOSLO modalities has been demonstrated to provide critical information about retinal microstructures. However, increasing detection channels requires expensive optical components and/or critically increases imaging time. To address this issue, we present an innovative combination of machine learning and optics as an integrated technology to compressively capture 12 nonconfocal channel AOSLO images simultaneously. Imaging of healthy participants and diseased subjects using the proposed deep compressed multichannel AOSLO showed enhanced visualization of rods, cones, and mural cells with over an order-of-magnitude improvement in imaging speed as compared to conventional offset aperture imaging. To facilitate the adaptation and integration with other in vivo microscopy systems, we made optical design, acquisition, and computational reconstruction codes open source."

Recent studies have documented the efficient generation of spin torque using spin-orbit interactions (SOIs); however, SOI use relies on the employment of rare metals such as platinum. Here, we demonstrate that a nanometer-thick gradient from silicon to aluminum, which consists of readily available elements from earth resources, can produce a spin torque as large as that of platinum despite the weak SOI of these compositions. The spin torque efficiency can be improved by decreasing the thickness of the gradient, while a sharp interface was not found to increase the spin torque. Moreover, the electric conductivity of the gradient material can be up to twice as large as that of platinum, which provides a way to reduce Joule heating losses in spintronic devices."

In this study, we establish a method to simulate excitation energy transfer within the entire photosystem II supercomplex by using network analysis integrated with quantum dynamic calculations. We then investigate the effects of the coexistence of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b by comparing various chlorophyll compositions. Our results reveal that the natural chlorophyll composition allows the excited energy to preferentially flow through specific domains that act as safety valves, preventing downstream overflow.

While volcanic ash (VA) has been shown to nucleate ice crystals efficiently in laboratory settings, its importance for ice formation in the atmosphere remains elusive. Here, we show evidence of cirrus modification by volcanic eruptions through ice nucleation on VA, revealed by abrupt changes in cirrus properties following volcanic eruptions based on satellite measurements. The distinct changes captured are a phenomenal decrease in number, an increase in size of ice crystals in cirrus clouds, and an increase in cirrus occurrences after ash-rich volcanic eruptions. Conversely, no such changes were detected following the ash-poor eruption. We propose a cirrus formation mechanism where VA nucleates ice heterogeneously, suppressing homogeneous freezing and resulting in fewer but larger ice crystals. This suppression of homogeneous freezing by VA is supported by process-level cloud microphysical simulations. Our findings advance the understanding of aerosol–ice cloud interactions and illuminate cirrus geoengineering."

Our data reveal that myeloid-specific Mac-1 significantly increases EAE severity and hinders disease regression. Loss of Mac-1 increases Gr-1+cells in peripheral tissues and the CNS and preferably accelerates the transition of Ly6Chimonocytes from a pro-inflammatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in a disease stage–dependent manner.

Insect muscles display a remarkable functional diversity: they operate at extremely different contraction frequencies (ranging from ~1 to 1000 hertz) and amplitudes during flying, walking, and crawling. This is puzzling because sarcomeres are built from essentially the same actin-myosin components. Here, we address how functionally different sarcomeres are made. We show that the giant protein titin and the regulation of developmental contractility are key for the sarcomere specializations. I-band titin spans and determines the length of the sarcomeric I-band in a muscle type–specific manner. Unexpectedly, I-band titin also rules the length of the force-generating myosin filament using a feedback mechanism that is modulated by myosin contractility. We propose a model of how sarcomere specializations in insects are tuned, provide evidence for this model, and discuss its validity beyond insects."

While traditional Pavlovian conditioning studies have provided valuable insights, the exclusive reliance on electric shock as a threat stimulus has limited our understanding of diverse threats. To address this, we developed a conditioning paradigm using a looming visual stimulus as an unconditioned stimulus (US) in mice and identified a distinct neural circuit for visual threat conditioning. Parabrachial CGRP neurons were necessary for both conditioning and memory retrieval. Upstream neurons in the posterior insular cortex (pIC) responded to looming stimuli, and their projections to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) induced aversive states and drove conditioning. However, this pIC-to-PBN pathway was not required for foot-shock conditioning. These findings reveal how non-nociceptive visual stimuli can drive aversive states and fear memory formation, expanding our understanding of aversive US processing beyond traditional models."

The electrostatic potential at the surface of the t-hBN substrate provides a simple way to confine excitons in the MoSe2monolayer. The excitons confined within the domains and at the domain walls are spectrally separated because of a pronounced Stark shift. Moreover, the patterned light emission can be dynamically controlled by electrically gating the ferroelectric domains, introducing a functionality beyond other semiconductor moiré superlattices.

Here, we uncover a hormonal cross-talk framework that orchestrates the age-related balance between plant growth and herbivore defense. We demonstrate that the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), synthesized byNicotiana benthamianaphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 6 (NbPAL6), dictates insect resistance in adult plants.NbPAL6expression is driven by the key transcription factor, NbMYB42, which is regulated by two interacting auxin response factors, NbARF18La/b. In juvenile plants, higher auxin levels activateNbmiR160c, a microRNA that simultaneously silencesNbARF18La/b, subsequently reducingNbMYB42expression, lowering SA accumulation, and thus weakening herbivore defense. Excessive SA in juvenile plants enhances defense but antagonizes auxin signaling, impairing early growth. Our findings suggest a seesaw-like model that balances growth and defense depending on the plant’s developmental stage."

This coordination is particularly critical in crowded tissues, such as pseudostratified epithelia (PSE) that are often found as organ precursors. They are composed of elongated epithelial cells with densely packed nuclei aligned along the apicobasal axis. While cell cycle–dependent nuclear movements in PSE are well studied, less is known about how nuclear packing influences tissue morphogenesis. To investigate this, we analyzed nuclear shapes, sizes, and neighborhood statistics in zebrafish neuroepithelia, focusing on the retinal PSE. We found that nuclei exhibit elongated shapes and biaxial nematic-like orientational order but remain positionally disordered. During retinal development, nuclear packing density increases, approaching theoretical limits. This occurs when the tissue transitions to a laminated structure and nuclear shapes are remodeled. Timely neurogenesis is critical as failure to initiate neurogenesis leads to tissue deformations. These findings highlight the influence of nuclear shape and positioning for organ morphogenesis."

However, a few glass beads in the soil from the Chang’e-5 mission have unusually high MgO contents that require distinct target compositions. The young age of these high-MgO glass beads suggests an origin through impact melting of ultramafic target rocks with abundant pyroxene and olivine. While such targets might represent cumulates of mare basalts, impact melts, or Mg-suite rocks, they appear unlike any sampled lunar lithologies. Alternatively, these high-Mg beads might be sampling the upper mantle brought to the surface by the Imbrium basin–forming event."
10.1126/sciadv.adr3173,False,Science Advances,该研究主要关注三阴性乳腺癌(TNBC)中26S蛋白酶体非ATPase调节亚基14 (PSMD14)的作用机制。研究发现PSMD14通过去泛素化和稳定SF3B4蛋白，进而影响FADS1 mRNA的m6A修饰，最终激活Akt/mTOR信号通路，促进TNBC的生长、侵袭和转移。此外，研究还发现将PSMD14敲低与外源性花生四烯酸补充相结合，可以诱导合成致死性，这为TNBC的治疗提供了一种潜在的生物标志物和铁死亡介导的治疗策略。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，没有直接关联。,[],Yuanhang Yu;Jin Hu;Wenwen Wang;Hao Lei;Zihan Xi;Peiyi Zhang;Ende Zhao;Chong Lu;Hengyu Chen;Chunping Liu;Lei Li,Targeting PSMD14 combined with arachidonic acid induces synthetic lethality via FADS1 m6A modification in triple-negative breast cancer,"Dysregulation of deubiquitination is essential for cancer growth. However, the role of 26Sproteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 14 (PSMD14) in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains to be determined. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that silencing PSMD14 notably attenuated the growth, invasion, and metastasis of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of PSMD14 produced the opposite results. Mechanistically, PSMD14 decreased K63-linked ubiquitination on SF3B4 protein to de-ubiquitin and stabilize SF3B4 protein. Then, SF3B4/HNRNPC complex bound to FADS1 mRNA and promoted exon inclusion in the target mRNA through m6A site on FADS1 mRNA recognized by HNRNPC, thereby up-regulating the expression of FADS1 and activating Akt/mTOR signaling. Exogenous arachidonic acid supplementation combined with PSMD14 knockdown induced synthetic lethality, which was further confirmed in TNBC organoid (PDO) and TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Overall, our findings reveal an oncogenic role of PSMD14 in TNBC progression, which indicates a potential biomarker and ferroptosis-mediated therapeutic strategy for TNBC."

Kinstlinger;Maya E. L. Rice;Jenny Deng;Wilson W. Wong,"Multiplexing light-inducible recombinases to control cell fate, Boolean logic, and cell patterning in mammalian cells","Light-inducible regulatory proteins are powerful tools to interrogate fundamental mechanisms driving cellular behavior. In particular, genetically encoded photosensory domains fused to split proteins can tightly modulate protein activity and gene expression. While light-inducible split protein systems have performed well individually, few multichromatic and orthogonal gene regulation systems exist in mammalian cells. The design space for multichromatic circuits is limited by the small number of orthogonally addressable optogenetic switches and the types of effectors that can be actuated by them. We developed a library of red light-inducible recombinases and directed patterned myogenesis in a mesenchymal fibroblast-like cell line. To address the limited number of light-inducible domains (LIDs) responding to unique excitation spectra, we multiplexed light-inducible recombinases with our “Boolean logic and arithmetic through DNA excision” (BLADE) platform. Multiplexed optogenetic tools will be transformative for understanding the role of multiple interacting genes and their spatial context in endogenous signaling networks."

However, the mechanisms underlying RF formation remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the C-mannosyltransferasedpy19l1l(dumpy-19 like 1 like) is expressed in the spinal cord during zebrafish embryonic development. Mutation indpy19l1lresulted in idiopathic scoliosis (IS)–like body axis curvature in the absence of muscle or cilia defects. URP2 expression was down-regulated indpy19l1l−/−mutants. Notably, RF formation was impaired indpy19l1l−/−mutants, and a similar phenotype was induced in wild-type embryos by injecting messenger RNA encoding a C-mannosylation catalytic site-mutateddpy19l1lvariant (E106Amdpy19l1l). Furthermore, E106A mDPY19L1L failed to glycosylate Flag-tagged SCO-spondin TSRs (thrombospondin type 1 repeats). Our findings suggest that DPY19L1L-mediated C-mannosylation of SCO-spondin TSRs promotes RF formation and URP2 induction, representing a critical supplementary mechanism for body axis straightening in zebrafish."
