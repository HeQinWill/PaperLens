While many studies project future recycling potential, they are often limited by the lack of data on existing distributed PV installations. To address this need, we developed SolarScope, an open-source model that integrates computer vision (CV) with dynamic material flow analysis (dMFA) to automatically identify distributed PV panel areas and evaluate the urban mining potential. By leveraging satellite imagery and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, SolarScope achieves an Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.93 for classification and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (Dice) score of 0.90 for segmenting distributed PV installations. A case study in Kamakura, Japan, demonstrates the model’s transferability and its ability to support material recovery assessments at fine spatial scales. We present a methodological framework that combines CV with dMFA to bottom-up estimate the regional material stock and recycling potential of distributed PV systems, providing a scalable solution to overcome data limitations in conventional material flow analysis and contributing to circular economy advancement."

However, the influence of agricultural management practices on the fate of such antibiotics in soil is poorly understood. In this study, we employed 14C-erythromycin to explore its transformation and fate under different agricultural management practices, including chicken manure amendment, activated sludge amendment (surface or mixing applications), and flooding. Erythromycin was rapidly mineralized in the unamended soil (t1/2 = 7.5 days, 91.8% at 120 days). However, the addition of chicken manure or flooding significantly inhibited the mineralization (47.3 and 69.0% at 120 days, respectively), promoted bound residue formation, and extended its half-life to 23.7–36.8 days. In contrast, activated sludge amendment enhanced erythromycin transformation with mixing applications (t1/2 = 7.2 days), while the surface application had limited effect (t1/2 = 8.0 days). High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that these practices significantly altered soil microbial communities, and in particular, fluctuations in the abundances of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria may have influenced erythromycin transformation. These findings underscore the urgent need to understand the environmental fate and risks of antibiotics under different agricultural practices and identify management practices that can effectively reduce antibiotic persistence and protect environmental health."

Although ZnO-NPs are known to induce cognitive deficits and motor dysfunction in organisms, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study systematically investigated ZnO-NPs-induced neurotoxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans, revealing significant perturbations in lipid homeostasis, concomitant with impaired foraging behavior, learning and memory deficits, and chemotaxis dysfunction, along with neuronal damage. Transcriptomic profiling identified critical enrichment of differentially expressed genes in lipid metabolism and glutathione-mediated detoxification pathways with concurrent dysregulation of oxidative stress-responsive and neurodevelopment-related gene networks. Notably, ZnO-NPs exposure triggered remarkable upregulation of the fat-5 gene, which encodes a key enzyme in palmitoleic acid (PA) biosynthesis. The impact of ZnO-NPs on lipid metabolic dysregulation was attenuated in the fat-5 knockout strain, and exogenous PA administration phenocopied the toxicological profile of nanoparticles. Importantly, combined intervention with oleic acid and glutathione effectively ameliorated disordered lipid metabolism, attenuated reactive oxygen species accumulation, and restored neuronal integrity. Our findings delineate a novel mechanistic paradigm wherein ZnO-NPs exert neurotoxicity through lipid remodeling-mediated oxidative damage, proposing a promising therapeutic strategy involving dietary supplementation with unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants to mitigate nanomaterial-induced toxicity."

Understanding their fates in organisms is crucial for assessing potential toxicity and health risks. This study quantitatively investigated the toxicokinetics of four aryl-eOPEs and compared them with tOPEs in Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 72) over a 20-day gavage exposure followed by a 9-day elimination period. The absorption rates of aryl-eOPEs (8.95–28.0%) were approximately 1/2 to 1/10 those of tOPEs (61.9–96.8%), with hydrophobicity and molecular weight being key impact factors. The total concentration of aryl-eOPEs in feces was nearly double that of tOPEs, yet only 6.86–23.6% resulted from metabolic clearance in rats. Most administered aryl-eOPEs were not absorbed by the body and were directly excreted via feces. However, the half-lives of aryl-eOPEs in rats were generally longer than those of tOPEs, with bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate) exhibiting the longest half-life (2.68–6.59 days), highlighting their potential health risks. Additionally, significant pulmonary accumulation of aryl-eOPEs was observed, with the liver, kidneys, and small intestines playing key roles in metabolism and clearance. This study elucidates the toxicokinetic behavior of aryl-eOPEs in mammals and highlights the influence of their physicochemical properties. These findings provide a scientific foundation for assessing their potential health effects."

In this study, we present a continuous, separation-free gas–solid photoreduction strategy for direct NH3 gas production from flue gas, enabled by dynamic band structure regulation of the photocatalyst. Comprehensive in situ characterization and theoretical analysis demonstrate that this approach utilizes photoexcited oxygen vacancies (PVO) in TiO2 to generate high-energy electrons in deep conduction bands, thereby enhancing the reduction capacity, accelerating electron transfer, and lowering the activation energy for both H2O dissociation and NO hydrogenation. The real-time tracking of NO radicals in a gas–solid system using operando EPR provides crucial mechanistic insights into high-energy electron behavior and the NO-to-NH3 conversion pathway, where these high-energy electrons not only promote efficient NO-to-NH3 conversion but also prevent toxic N2O byproduct formation, ensuring selective and efficient reduction. The optimized TiO2–PVO catalyst achieves an NH3 production rate of 79.86 ± 3.48 μmol g–1 h–1 with nearly 100% selectivity, a 16-fold improvement over pristine TiO2. This study offers valuable insights into solar-driven gas–solid NH3 synthesis from flue NOx."

The model incorporates ice-concentration-based (ICB) constraints to improve the accuracy of oil transport and weathering simulation under varying ice conditions. Using observational data from multiscale field experiments, including the FEX2009 spill in the Barents Sea and the mesoscale experiments in Svalbard, we evaluated the model’s capability to simulate oil trajectories, mass balance, and oil property evolution. A comparative hindcast analysis, with and without ice-related inputs, demonstrates that incorporating ice data significantly enhances the performance of oil transport modeling. Through multiple simulation scenarios, the effectiveness of various combinations of ICB constraints and target components was assessed to identify the optimal approach for modeling oil fate in ice-covered waters. Our findings indicate that the “30/80” rule-of-thumb, originally used to model oil movement under varying ice cover, does not apply to oil fate modeling in ice conditions. In contrast, the newly proposed quadratic reduction method provides more reliable simulations of oil behavior in icy environments. The OSMT-ice model, with its enhanced weathering algorithms, offers a robust tool for assessing oil spill impacts in ice-covered waters, improving response strategies and risk assessments. This research contributes to advancing oil spill modeling in Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions, with practical implications for oil spill contingency planning."

This study utilized conventional and network meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to environmentally relevant MP concentrations. Results showed that, compared with uncontaminated soil, polypropylene increased CH4 emissions by 2.01 times, while polyethylene terephthalate reduced them to 0.47 times. Polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) and polylactic acid/PBAT increased CO2 emissions by 3.13 and 2.70 times, respectively; polyethylene raised N2O emissions by 1.52 times. Other MPs had no significant impact. Most types of MPs increased GHG emissions, with conventional MPs contributing more to N2O emissions and biodegradable MPs contributing more to CO2 emissions. Biodegradable plastics were not necessarily more environmentally friendly in terms of global warming potential. Moreover, the study summarized issues in current meta-analyses targeting MPs, emphasizing the need to prioritize MP types, account for correlations and interactions among moderators, ensure effect size independence, and address potential “P-hacking” during the discretization of continuous variables. This deepens our comprehension of the environmental impacts of MPs and provides valuable guidance for future meta-analyses to accurately assess effects of MPs."

Lamb,Implementation of a Novel Natural Gas Distribution Screening Approach for High Flow Rate Below Ground Leaks Integrated with Company-Specific Emission Factors for Measurement-Informed Annual Emission Inventories,"In this study, a novel screening method was implemented by a local distribution company (LDC) to identify below ground pipeline leaks that have high leak flow rates (≥10 scfh CH4, 3.19 g/min) for the purpose of prioritizing repairs and reducing methane emissions. This decision tree (DT) method correlates methane concentration measurements as a function of defined ground surface conditions to leak flow rate. Established threshold methane surface concentrations at each defined surface condition category is used to identify leaks with high flow rates. Direct leak flow rate measurements at more than 400 leak sites were used to evaluate the method and determine the frequency of correctly classifying leak rate bins. These data were used in conjunction with annual leak inventory data to provide robust company-specific CH4 emission factors (C-SEFs) with 90% confidence intervals (CI) of ∼±20%. State-of-the-art statistical analyses, bootstrap resampling, Monte Carlo, and Bayesian probabilistic analyses were used to estimate the DT errors, calculate the C-SEFs and confidence bounds, and estimate annual system emissions with CIs. These C-SEFs explicitly treat the skewed distributions of high flow rate vs low flow rate leaks: 13.3 scfh CH4 (CI 10.4 to 16.6) for leaks ≥10 scfh CH4 and 1.82 scfh CH4 (CI 1.52 to 2.16) for leaks <10 scfh CH4. Furthermore, these C-SEFs do not depend on classification of pipeline types and avoid issues with assigning a pipeline type for each leak. National methane emission estimates from natural gas distribution systems are outdated and have high uncertainty; however, C-SEFs can solve this problem. For the Southern California Gas Company system, annual leak emissions for 2015, before the method was implemented, were 38.3 Gg CH4/yr, similar to an estimate using EPA emission factors. More importantly, the postimplementation 2023 emission estimate of 8.98 Gg CH4/yr (CI 7.33 to 10.8) was 75% less than estimated for 2015. This emission reduction resulted from aggressive improvement in leak management practices implemented since 2015, including increased leak surveys, reduction of leak inventory, and application of the DT method to prioritize high flow leaks for repair."

Bertram;Alexander Laskin,Distinct Gas-Particle Partitioning and Viscosity Characteristics of Secondary Organic Aerosols Derived from α-Pinene versus Ocimene,"Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) have complex, multicomponent composition that controls particle viscosity and gas-particle partitioning, key factors to their atmospheric evolution. This study investigates the chemical composition, volatility and viscosity of SOA formed by ozonolysis of cyclic α-pinene (PSOA) and acyclic ocimene (OSOA) monoterpenes. Using Temperature-Programmed Desorption combined with Direct Analysis in Real-Time ionization and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry, we determined the molecular composition and saturation mass concentration of individual SOA constituents. These data enabled gas-particle partitioning and viscosity estimates under varied atmospheric conditions. PSOA, composed of higher molecular weight and less oxidized species, shows higher condensability and viscosity under high total organic mass (tOM) loadings. In contrast, OSOA, consisting of more oxidized, lower molecular weight species, exhibits greater sensitivity to tOM, with viscosity increasing significantly upon dilution. Poke-flow experiments support this trend, indicating that OSOA undergoes more dynamic compositional and phase changes during atmospheric aging. These observations reveal distinct dynamic trends in the atmospheric transformations and reactivity of SOA from cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes, with the latter showing greater compositional changes during aging that alter viscosity and diffusion. This highlights the importance of incorporating such dynamic transformations into atmospheric models to improve predictions of SOA atmospheric loadings, lifetimes, and impacts."

Wildfires reduce vegetation, organic layers, and surface albedo, leading to active layer thickening and ground subsidence. Recent studies using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) have confirmed the rapid and extensive post‐fire permafrost degradation, and have largely focused on short‐term impacts. However, the longer‐term post‐fire permafrost deformation, potentially persisting for decades, remains poorly understood due to limited data. Here, we applied InSAR in North Yukon to detect deformation signals across multiple fire scars in the past five decades. Using a chronosequence (space‐for‐time substitution) approach, we summarize a continuous trajectory of post‐fire permafrost evolution: (a) an initial degradation stage, characterized by abrupt subsidence up to 50 mm/year and gradually slowing over the first decade, with cumulative subsidence exceeding 100 mm locally; (b) an aggradation stage from approximately 15 to 30 years after fire, marked by ground uplift reaching 25 mm/year before gradually declining, compensating for the earlier subsidence; and (c) a stabilization stage beyond three to four decades, where permafrost nearly recovers to pre‐fire conditions with indistinguishable deformation between burned and unburned areas. Notably, the rarely‐reported uplift phase appears closely related to vegetation regeneration and fire‐greening feedback that provide thermal protection, suggesting a critical mechanism of permafrost recovery. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of boreal‐permafrost systems to wildfires and also underscore the importance of long‐term InSAR monitoring in understanding permafrost responses to wildfires under climate change."

By utilizing high‐frequency, high‐resolution satellite imagery, MAMVs can provide novel important information on evolving wind fields that can influence typhoon structure, intensity, and track. This enhanced data, when assimilated, can lead to improve the skill of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models for typhoon prediction. To evaluate the effectiveness of MAMVs toward improving typhoon forecasts, this study assimilates MAMVs into NWP model and compares them with assimilating FY‐4B/AGRI operational atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) and control experiments without MAMVs/AMVs assimilation. It is shown that for two typhoon cases, the assimilation of MAMVs can improve typhoon dynamic field and reduce typhoon track forecast errors.

In Central Africa, previous studies widely emphasize large‐scale influences, often overlooking complex regional processes. In this study, we combined the capacity of vertically integrated moisture flux convergence (VIMFC) to capture information from the entire atmospheric column with the ability of convolutional neural networks to learn complex, nonlinear patterns from large and intricate data sets, thereby unlocking VIMFC's potential as an effective regional predictor. Our machine learning model successfully identifies 95% of observed extreme rainfall events using VIMFC as input. The CNN's predictions, interpreted using the layer‐wise relevance propagation method, highlight its ability to capture spatiotemporal distributions of strong moisture convergence and divergence linked to extreme rainfall and drought events. Over the past two decades, we have observed a clear increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation moisture flux patterns (EPMFPs), which aligns with rising extreme rainfall occurrences. On EPMFP days, we detect stronger low‐level moisture inflow from the Atlantic Ocean and enhanced moisture supply driven by a deeper and more intense Congo Basin convective cell. This is supported by evapotranspiration from the basin's dense vegetation, acting as a continental moisture reservoir. Midlevel analysis reveals more moisture retention over the region during EPMFPs, linked to the positioning and strength of the African easterly jets. While both EPMFP and non‐EPMFP composites show similar meridional moisture transport, distinct zonal moisture outflow and inflow patterns highlight the dynamical differences between the two regimes."

Satellite passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing offers a unique advantage for retrieving ET under cloudy conditions, where optical remote sensing fails. However, existing PMW‐based ET retrieval methods face uncertainties at a global scale, particularly across diverse land types and climates. Additionally, observations from China's Fengyun‐3D (FY‐3D) satellite have not been utilized for global ET estimation. To address these challenges, this study combined in situ ET measurements from 207 flux towers across 13 vegetation types with FY‐3D microwave radiation imager observations and reanalysis data sets. A machine‐learning genetic algorithm (GA) was developed to optimize key parameters of the PMW‐based ET retrieval method, generating a new global ET product (ETFY3D) with 0.25° resolution for 2020–2022. Evaluations at flux towers showed significantly improved accuracy compared to the original algorithm, reducing bias by 1.07 mm/day and root mean square error by 0.85 mm/day while increasing the Kling‐Gupta efficiency by 0.67. The ETFY3D was further evaluated against three independent global ET products: the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer product, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model, and the Penman‐Monteith‐Leuning (PML) product. The comparison showed that ETFY3D performed consistently with these benchmark products at a global scale. Sensitivity analysis highlighted vegetation and humidity parameters' importance.

Projections of contributions from individual components were more variable, with a notable underestimation of dynamic mass loss from ice sheets. Nevertheless—and in view of the comparatively limited process understanding, modeling capabilities, and computational resources available three decades ago—these early attempts should inspire confidence in presently available global sea‐level projections.

 The OSIRIS-REx mission deployed contact pad samplers to collect regolith from the uppermost surface of the asteroid Bennu that was exposed to the space environment. Space weathering processes, dominated by micrometeoroid impacts and solar irradiation, modify the mineralogy and chemistry of exposed surfaces to produce solar wind-amorphized layers on clays, metallic whiskers associated with high temperature melts and Fe nitride created by the reaction of indigenous N-bearing gases with space-weathered surfaces. Here, we use cosmogenic noble gases and radionuclides to suggest that the upper metre of Bennu’s regolith has been exposed to cosmic rays for 2–7 million years, consistent with remote sensing observations indicating that the asteroid’s surface is dynamic and regularly modified by mass movement. Solar energetic particle track and microcrater densities constrain the space weathering spectral changes observed in Hokioi crater to <50,000 years. These spectral changes are driven largely by the accumulation of impact melt deposits on particle surfaces, although compositional or grain size effects may also occur. Comparison of Bennu samples with those collected from the asteroids Ryugu and Itokawa suggest that micrometeoroid impacts might play a more active and rapid role in the space weathering of asteroidal surfaces than was initially suggested, particularly for carbonaceous bodies.

 Samples of asteroid (101955) Bennu delivered by the OSIRIS-REx mission offer the opportunity to study pristine planetary materials unchanged by exposure to the terrestrial environment. Here we use a combination of X-ray diffraction and various electron microscopy techniques to explore the detailed mineralogy of Bennu samples and determine the alteration history of the planetesimal protolith from which they originated. The samples consist largely of hydrated sheet-silicate minerals, namely nanoscale serpentine and saponite of varied grain size, which are decorated with micro- to nanoscale Fe-sulfides, magnetite and carbonates. We observe sheet silicates parallel and normal to sulfide surfaces and as inclusions in sulfides; sulfur-rich veins transecting the sheet-silicate matrix; zoned carbonates and phosphates and sulfide and magnetite grains exhibiting embayment. The mineralogical evidence indicates alteration of accreted minerals by a fluid that evolved with time, leading to etching, dissolution and reprecipitation. Sulfide compositions indicate alteration at ~25 °C, similar to conditions inferred for asteroid (162173) Ryugu and Ivuna-type (CI) chondrite meteorites. The fluid probably evolved from neutral to alkaline, culminating with the precipitation of highly soluble salts. We conclude that Bennu’s protolith comprised mainly nanometre to micrometre silicates, with fewer chondrules and calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions than those of most chondrite groups.

This modification ensures timely mitotic entry, unveiling a previously unrecognized interface between PKA signaling and cell cycle regulation. 
 Timely entry into mitosis requires activation of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) by Aurora kinase A (Aurora A), but the upstream signaling trigger remains unclear. Here, we show that cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling serves as a critical initiator of mitosis in mammalian cells. Specifically, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates Bora, enabling it to bind Aurora A and recruit it to the Bora-Plk1 complex during G2 phase, thereby facilitating Aurora A-dependent activation of Plk1. Disruption of PKA-mediated Bora phosphorylation or the Bora-Aurora A interaction impairs Plk1 activation and delays the G2-to-mitosis (G2/M) transition. Conversely, a phospho-mimetic Bora mutant bypasses the requirement for PKA in promoting Bora-Aurora A interaction, Plk1 activation, and mitotic entry. Furthermore, PKA-mediated Bora phosphorylation and the resulting Bora-Aurora A interaction are essential for mitotic entry during DNA damage checkpoint recovery. Together, these findings identify the cAMP-PKA-Bora-Aurora A-Plk1 signaling cascade as a previously unrecognized and critical trigger for mitotic commitment.

 Molecular machines play pivotal roles in all biological processes. Most structural methods, however, are unable to directly probe molecular motions. Here, we demonstrate that dedicated NMR experiments can provide quantitative insights into functionally important dynamic regions in very large asymmetric protein complexes. We establish this for the 410 kDa eukaryotic RNA exosome complex that contains ten distinct protein chains. Methyl-group and fluorine NMR experiments reveal site-specific interactions among subunits and with an RNA substrate. Furthermore, we extract quantitative insights into conformational changes within the complex in response to substrate and subunit binding for regions that are invisible in static cryo-EM and crystal structures. In particular, we identify a flexible plug region that can block an aberrant route for RNA towards the active site. Based on molecular dynamics simulations and NMR data, we provide a model that shows how the flexible plug is structured in the open and closed conformations. Our work thus demonstrates that a combination of state-of-the-art structural biology methods can provide quantitative insights into large molecular machines that go significantly beyond the well-resolved and static images of biomolecular complexes, thereby adding the time domain to structural biology.

This study identified loci that underlie hybrid viability and seasonal migration in a hybrid zone between songbirds with different migratory behavior. 
 Extrinsic postzygotic isolation, where hybrids experience reductions in fitness due to a mismatch with their environment, is central to speciation. Knowledge of genetic variants that underlie extrinsic isolation is crucial for understanding the early stages of speciation. Differences in seasonal migration are strong candidates for extrinsic isolation (e.g., if hybrids take intermediate and inferior routes compared to pure forms). Here, we used a hybrid zone between two subspecies of the songbird Swainson’s thrush (Catharus ustulatus) with different migratory routes and tests for viability selection (locus-specific changes in interspecific heterozygosity and ancestry mismatch across age classes) to gain insight into the genetic basis of extrinsic isolation. Using data from over 900 individuals we find strong evidence for viability selection on both interspecific heterozygosity and ancestry mismatch at loci linked to migration. Much of this selection was dependent on genome-wide ancestry; as expected, a subset of hybrids exhibited reduced viability, but remarkably, another subset appears to fill an unoccupied fitness peak within the species, exhibiting higher viability than even parental forms. Many of the variants that influence hybrid viability appear to occur in structural variants, including a putative pericentric inversion. Our study emphasizes the importance of epistatic interactions and structural variants in speciation.

Here, the authors show that prolonged exposure to food odor suppresses food intake and body weight gain by activating an olfactory bulb–hypothalamus circuit. 
 Olfactory perception of food odors is a key determinant of eating behavior, including triggering appetite, facilitating food seeking and influencing food choice. While transient food-related olfactory cues stimulate appetite and provoke cravings in states of hunger, emerging evidence implies that prolonged and sustained exposure to food-derived odor (FO) suppresses feeding. However, the mechanisms by which olfaction induces hypophagia remain elusive. In this study, we show that prolonged FO exposure significantly suppresses food intake in male mice. We identified a subset of neurons in the ventral subiculum (vSub) that are specifically activated by FO. We further discovered that these FO-activated neurons in the vSub receive excitatory inputs from the olfactory bulb (OB) and send glutamatergic projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Inhibition of the OB → vSub → VMH circuit abolished the FO-induced reduction in food intake, while activation of this circuit suppressed feeding and reduced body weight. Together, these findings reveal a neurobiological circuitry that mediates the influence of olfactory signals on food intake regulation.

 Osmotically varying environments are challenging for bacterial cells. Sudden drops in osmolytes cause an increased membrane tension and rupture the cells in the absence of protective mechanisms. One family of protective proteins are mechanosensitive channels of small conductance that open in response to membrane tension. Although these channels have a common architecture, they vary widely in the number of transmembrane helices, conductivity, and gating characteristics. Although there are various structures of channels in the open and closed state, the underlying common principles of the gating mechanism remain poorly understood. Here we show that YnaI opens by radial relocation of the transmembrane sensor paddles together with a shortening of the pore, which contrasts the prototypic smaller MscS. A chimera of both channels with the YnaI sensor paddles and the pore containing C-terminal part of MscS is functional and has the tension response of the paddle donor. Our research shows that elements with different structural opening mechanisms can be mixed and matched within one channel as long as they support the common area expansion on the periplasmic side.

Here, the authors measure interactions of metal surface atoms with CO-terminated tips to reveal their nature and reliable adsorption sites. 
 Metal surfaces play a key role in on-surface synthesis as they provide a two-dimensional catalytic reaction environment that stimulates activation, diffusion, and coupling of molecular reactants. Fundamental understanding of the interactions between surface atoms and reactants is very limited but would enable controlling on-surface reaction processes for designing functional nanomaterials. Here, we measure chemical interactions between CO-terminated tips and Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) surface atoms in all spatial directions with picometer resolution via low temperature atomic force microscopy. This allows a site-specific quantification of the weak chemical interactions of densely packed metal surface atoms and provides a picture of the potential energy landscape experienced by adsorbed reactants. Accompanying density functional theory calculations and the crystal orbital overlap population method reveal small covalent binding contributions from orbital overlap of the corresponding p- and d-states of the CO tip and the metal surface atoms as the cause for the site-specific interactions. Accessing such small covalent bonding contributions in the background of the dispersion-dominated interaction enables revealing insights into the nature of chemical bond formation with metal surface atoms and a reliable determination of molecular adsorption sites. The latter can serve both as a starting point and as a direct comparison with theoretical studies.

 Local climate zone (LCZ) provides a detailed classification system for building types in urban areas and offers a unified standard for block-scale surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies. However, LCZ mapping methods with high classification accuracy for global applicability, and multi-city comparison of SUHI based on LCZ are still needed. In this study, we developed a transferable LCZ mapping framework for 30 China cities at 120 m by using multi-source remote sensing and GIS data, and random forest model. The gap-filled LST for 21 cities among 30 cities with diverse urbanized levels and climate conditions were generated, utilizing Landsat 8 data, LST retrieval algorithm and gap-filling method. Spatial patterns of SUHI intensity across climate zones and cities of different sizes were explored, and the impacts of urban morphology on SUHI in built-up LCZs were analyzed using the boosted regression trees model. Results showed that the proposed LCZ mapping framework achieved high accuracy in China cities, with overall accuracy from 0.86 to 0.93. Its robustness and transferability were further demonstrated in three cities in the United States with overall accuracy of 0.91 to 0.93. LST gap-filling method also performed well, with R from 0.71 to 0.91 and RMSE from 1.86 °C to 3.59 °C, respectively. Our multi-city assessment revealed consistent patterns of SUHI in LCZs across climate zones: compact mid-rise (LCZ 2) and large low-rise (LCZ 8) had the highest SUHI intensity, while sparsely built (LCZ 9) and open low-rise (LCZ 6) had the lowest values. Moreover, LCZ 2 tended to have higher SUHI intensity in colder climate regions, while LCZ 8 exhibited higher values in warmer climate regions. City size also influenced SUHI effect in built-up LCZs, with large cities exhibiting SUHI intensity up to 1 °C higher than small cities. Additionally, vegetation exhibited the largest of relative importance (20 % to 68 %) which impacted SUHI intensity in built-up LCZs, with a higher value in cold cities compared to warm cities. Impervious or building surface fraction also accounted for 13 % to 45 % of the SUHI contribution across LCZs, with relative importance about 3 % to 10 % greater in warmer and larger cities.

 Changes in forest structure (FS) significantly influence forest conditions and dynamics, ecosystem services, including biomass accumulation and biodiversity. Several LiDAR metrics have been described to analyse FS at a high spatial resolution, including vertical and horizontal attributes. This study aimed to investigate FS development in spruce (Picea abies), oak (Quercus robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) through the first 50 years after planting and their relationship to biomass stocks and richness of arrival tree species. LiDAR and ground truth data were extracted from 60 plots. To characterize the FS, LiDAR metrics were calculated using a point cloud of 5.4 pulses/m2 under leaf-off conditions from 2019. Moreover, trees were measured in 2022 following the Danish National Forest Inventory protocols to calculate biomass and estimate tree species richness. FS changes and their relationship were analyzed by employing linear mixed models and principal component analysis (PCA). Results show that spruce stands exhibited rapid growth in height and the highest canopy cover values over time. Contrarily, oak stands developed a multi-layer canopy, increasing light availability and tree size variability with age. At later stages, beech stands reached similar height as spruce and showed the highest standard deviation of height (StDH) with age. The PCA revealed that tree maximum height and StDH were primarily age-dependent, while the internal vertical and horizontal variability tree species dependent. Spruce showed a constant homogeneous FS, oak was characterized by a high internal and external FS heterogeneity, while beech gradually decreased the FS variability over time. Old, tall and structurally homogeneous beech and spruce stands supported the highest biomass accumulation. Conversely, more structurally heterogeneous oak stands tended to harbor greater tree species richness. The study underscores the importance of incorporating both vertical and horizontal dimensions to understand FS changes and the trade-offs between biomass production and biodiversity in monoculture afforestation."

Knowledges about global RFI are important for the protection of the microwave bands allocated for active remote sensing, SAR system design and operation, as well as the systematic mitigation of RFI for SAR data end users. It is becoming more important as we are entering the unprecedented golden age of L-band SAR satellites. In this work, we develop algorithms, workflow and system for operationally measuring global RFI experienced by L-band SAR data. We define a data format for recording the RFI measurements, which facilitates the computation of a number of RFI metrics. We process all available L-band SAR data acquired by the JAXA ALOS-1 (2006–2011) and JERS-1 (1992–1998) satellites. For comparison with RFI in C-band data, we also process part of the ESA Envisat (2002−2012) data archive acquired in the same time frame (2005–2007). The final results provide a global view of RFI at L-band, showing its spatial and temporal variations. We find heavy RFI pollutions in East Asia, North America, and the region consisting of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Comparison of results from ALOS-1 and JERS-1 indicates the increasing trend of RFI pollution. Comparison with C-band Envisat result shows that RFI at L-band is significantly more severe than at C-band. Comparison of results from different polarizations shows that cross polarization data are more susceptible to RFI due to their lower radar backscatter. The global RFI distribution from L-band SAR data is found similar to that from L-band passive radiometers including SMOS and SMAP."

 Estimating peak snow water equivalent (SWE) across the Northern Hemisphere is critical for assessing seasonal water availability for both ecosystems and human needs. This study is the first to demonstrate a direct link between peak SWE and the temporal variability of L-band surface emission under a moderately dense vegetation canopy. We introduce SWEFormer, a novel deep transformer neural network that retrieves peak SWE primarily using time series of L-band brightness temperatures from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellite. The model is trained using an incremental learning approach that transfers low-level information from reanalysis data for spatially coherent high-level learning from sparse in situ observations. SWEFormer outperforms leading global products, including ERA5, GlobSnow, and AMSR-based estimates, particularly in complex boreal watersheds, where previous global SWE estimates suffer from significant uncertainties, as vegetation canopy often markedly attenuates high-frequency microwave signatures of snowpack."

 The accurate retrieval of land surface phenology (LSP) for drylands is extremely challenging. Drylands exhibit vegetation characteristics such as sparse and patchy vegetation cover, low seasonal greenness variability, and high spatial heterogeneity. The irregular rainy and dry episodes often complicate vegetation growth, leading to an irregular temporal trajectory with multiple growth stages during the greenup and senescence phases. Moreover, the heterogeneous phenological cycles among the vegetation species in a satellite pixel and other factors may lead to a long period with only a very slight increase or decrease in greenness before or after a vegetation growing cycle. Current phenological retrieval methods, however, commonly assume that vegetation greenness gradually increases in a greenup phase and decreases in a senescence phase, following a single sigmoidal growth trajectory, which is inadequate to describe the irregular growth in drylands. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm to improve on the hybrid piecewise logistic model (HPLM) for improving LSP retrievals, especially in drylands. Our enhanced HPLM (E-HPLM) algorithm addresses two characteristics of irregular growth trajectories: (1) the multiple plateau stages within a greenup or senescence phase, and (2) the long linear tail before the start or after the end of a growing season. Specifically, we identified multiple growth stages within a greenup or senescence phase in order to fit each stage separately with a logistic model, and added a linear parameter to the logistic model to eliminate long linear tails by adjusting the background values. We implemented this new algorithm to retrieve LSPs in global drylands using the 500 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) dataset from 2013 to 2022. The results were then compared with those of HPLM-retrieved LSPs. We also evaluated the E-HPLM results using phenometrics derived from the PhenoCam observations at site levels and the fused Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS)-PhenoCam dataset at regional levels. The E-HPLM was able to reduce the uncertainty by ∼10 days in the pixels with plateau stages from 2013 to 2022 in global drylands in comparison with the HPLM algorithm, where the plateau stage appeared in over 74 % of drylands. Compared with the HPLM, the E-HPLM improved overall phenology accuracy by two days for the PhenoCam sites and one to four days in HLS-PhenoCam areas, although the improvements varied with land cover types and aridity levels. The E-HPLM algorithm has the potential to replace the current HPLM algorithm, with improved ability to retrieve LSP in drylands and to generate global LSP products."

 Geohazards are sudden and catastrophic. Due to the complicated topography, geology and climate conditions along the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Transportation Corridor (QTPTC), many geohazards pose unprecedented challenges for engineering construction. Comprehensive and scientific geohazard detection has been infrequently performed in the QTPTC, so the study area still lacks a comprehensive geological hazard inventory. With the development of earth observation techniques, detecting geohazards in wide areas is possible. However, comprehensive geohazard detection over such a large spatial extent is considered impossible by individual remote sensing techniques and images. In this study, we used a combination of GACOS-assisted Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) phases, SAR amplitudes, and optical images to acquire deformational and geomorphological information of geohazards along the QTPTC. Based on deformational and geomorphological information, we establish a catalogue containing 2109 geohazards which were classified into five categories, i) actively deforming slopes (994); ii) reactivated historically deformed slopes (84); iii) stabilized historically deformed slopes (732); iv) glacier (283) and v) glacial lakes (16). A large percentage of geohazards are distributed at an elevation of 2500–5000 m with slope angles of 30-40°, five geohazards concentration regions are distributed on main active fault zones, and the types of geohazards in the five regions are influenced by precipitation and surface temperature. Finally, three field surveys were also carried out to verify 141 geohazards along the QTPTC. The above findings can improve disaster prevention and mitigation capabilities for construction and operation along the QTPTC."

 Grasslands play a crucial role in carbon cycling, biodiversity conservation, and human welfare. Identifying the drivers of grassland greening is essential for forecasting ecosystem responses to future climate change and developing effective adaptation strategies. Grasslands worldwide have experienced pronounced greening trends over recent decades. Despite this widespread phenomenon, the underlying biophysical mechanisms and dominant drivers remain insufficiently understood. By integrating satellite observations with model simulations, we show consistent increases in global grassland leaf area index (LAI) across both historical periods and future scenarios. A sustained increase in summer LAI is identified as the primary driver of grassland greening, contributing approximately 43.28% to the overall trend. Grassland greening exhibits strong spatial heterogeneity, with humid regions accounting for the largest contribution (i.e., 67.27%). Correlation analysis, structural equation modeling, and ridge regression reveal distinct regional differences in the dominant drivers across aridity gradients. Soil moisture (SM) emerges as the primary driver in arid regions, while temperature plays a more prominent role in semi-arid areas. In sub-humid and humid regions, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exerts a stronger influence on grassland LAI dynamics. Moreover, the synergistic effect of temperature and VPD enhances summer greening, particularly in humid regions and high-latitude areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Notably, the influence of VPD transitions from inhibitory in arid regions to facilitative in humid environments. In contrast, the role of SM in shaping vegetation dynamics weakens progressively along the aridity gradient. These findings advance our understanding of how grassland ecosystems respond to varying hydroclimatic conditions and offer key insights for forecasting vegetation dynamics under future climate change."

 Rapid global urbanization has led to water eutrophication, threatening the stability of aquatic ecosystems stability. Chlorophyll-a (Chla), a key indicator of algal biomass, is a widely recognized as a metric for eutrophication. However, existing remote sensing retrieval methods face limitations in addressing complex environmental variations. This study developed an innovative Dynamic Model Pool (DMP) framework to optimize water quality prediction performance dynamically. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and monthly in-situ Chla measurement data from Erhai located in Southwest China spanning 2018 to 2020, this study tested the effectiveness of the DMP framework. The results demonstrated that: (1) The DMP framework dynamically selected the optimal model based on data-specific characteristics. In 2018, the CBR model achieved the highest accuracy, while in 2019, GBR and XGBR were the most accurate. In 2020, GBR outperformed other models. (2) Spatiotemporal Chla distribution maps recorded consistently higher concentrations in the south part of lake, while the central part showed minimal level and variation. (3) Seasonal precipitation and temperature variations and policy implementation were key drivers of Chla concentration changes. Seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature collectively influenced the nutrient input and dilution dynamics in Erhai. Meanwhile, policy interventions implemented between 2018 and 2022, such as pollution interception and wastewater treatment, substantially decreased nutrient inflows during flood seasons and effectively limited nutrient accumulation."

 The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is a typical economically developed and densely populated coastal city cluster. During warm seasons, the YRD generally suffers from extreme weather when tropical cyclones (TCs) make landfall. However, the YRD is also affected by severe ozone (O3) pollution when TCs are not far away. It has been reported that the peripheral flow of TCs is related to the regional O3 pollution over the YRD. Nevertheless, the tracks and locations of TCs, as well as the mechanisms of their effects, are still unclear. This study tries to reveal how and where TCs cause regional O3 pollution in the YRD based on a comprehensive analysis of prevailing synoptic weather patterns (SWPs) and high-impact TC tracks. For weather patterns, the NCEP reanalysis data and the Principal Component Analysis in T-mode (PCT) analysis method were adopted to objectively classify the 850 hPa geopotential height field in the YRD from 2018 to 2021. By integrating the air pollution observation data and the meteorological data in the YRD of the same period, a systematic analysis of the O3 pollution characteristics and their formation mechanism under different SWPs was conducted. Meanwhile, trajectory clustering analysis was conducted on TC track data to investigate the mechanisms of TCs with different paths on O3 pollution in the YRD. The results indicate that O3 concentration in the YRD generally peaks in June and September, and regional O3 pollution usually occurs before TCs land and after TCs dissipate. The SWPs in the YRD can be categorized into seven categories. Among them, SWP3 and SWP4 are SWPs that will be affected by TCs, while SWP6 and SWP7, which have similar circulation situations, are not affected by TCs. TCs are very important weather systems in SWP3 and SWP4. Furthermore, based on O3 pollution classification under different SWPs and TC track clustering analysis, how TC trajectories and central locations affect regional O3 pollution over the YRD is revealed. Under SWP3, TCs usually have the northwest-turning track, and cause the highest O3 pollution levels in the YRD when their centers are located in the area of (130°–135°E, 20°–30°N). Downdrafts caused by western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and the peripheral downward airflows of TCs make the air more stagnant over the YRD. The accumulation of air pollutants, as well as more intensive chemical reactions due to higher temperature, are the main cause of regional O3 pollution. For SWP4, however, TCs generally have the westward track, and regional O3 pollution in the YRD occurs when TCs are located over the area of (125°–130°E, 10°–16°N) with stronger intensities. More O3 is transported from inland polluted areas to the YRD due to the peripheral advection airflows of the strong TCs under SWP4. There are fewer downward airflows caused by TCs when the YRD is under SWP4 than under SWP3. These findings provide a new perspective on the intricate mechanisms underlying the interactions between TCs and coastal region O3 pollution. They also provide an important scientific basis for the prediction, early warning, and targeted prevention and control of severe O3 pollution in coastal cities, while also offering crucial guidance for optimizing regional air quality management strategies and formulating more precise pollution prevention and control measures."

 We examined the interannual variability in ozone (O3) and water vapor (H2O) in the lower stratospheric vortex over Antarctica using 19 years of measurements (2004–2022) from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). We focused on the period of the southern hemisphere winter (11–20 September), late winter (21–30 September), and spring (1–10 October) because O3 and H2O dynamics show the most variation during these times. We used a low-pass filter to focus on variations lasting 10 days or longer. The Mann Kendall test and regression analysis were employed to identify linear or non-linear trends. Our findings showed that the vortex-average O3 increased at 0.01 ppm yr−1. In contrast, the vortex-averaged H₂O showed no significant trend, although localized increases in H₂O were significantly obvious across all latitudes. In addition to the well-known effects of the Montreal Protocol, we hypothesize that the localized increase in H₂O is driven by the redistribution of water vapor due to strengthened Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) dynamics, characterized by enhanced horizontal transport, which, however, is insufficient to induce significant changes in vortex-averaged H₂O. The observed out-of-phase trend between the vertical and horizontal branches of the BDC serves to validate our BDC speed calculation. These results highlight the complex interplay between dynamics and chemistry in the polar stratosphere, emphasizing that while O₃ recovery continues, localized changes in H₂O do not yet significantly impact the vortex-averaged H₂O levels. Our study provides new insights and observational evidence into the role of BDC dynamics and stratospheric ozone recovery, underscoring the importance of both chemical and dynamic processes in shaping the future evolution of the stratospheric ozone layer."

 This study evaluates the simulation capabilities of 11 CMIP6 global climate models for hydrological cycle components in Northwest China (NWC) during 1995–2014, utilizing ERA5 reanalysis data for validation. Results demonstrate that the CMIP6 ensemble effectively captures spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation, precipitation recycling ratio (ρ), and internal/external cycling precipitation. Subsequent analysis compares projected hydrological changes under SSP1–2.6 (low-emission) and SSP5–8.5 (high-emission) scenarios (2021−2100) against the historical baseline. The findings suggest that NWC is projected to experience a wetter climate in the future, with precipitation increase rates of 0.52 % per decade under the SSP1–2.6 and 3.12 % per decade under the SSP5–8.5. The most rapid intensification occurs in the early 21st century (2021–2040), followed by mid-21st century (2041–2060) deceleration in the growth rate. By the end of the century (2081–2100), precipitation declines under SSP1–2.6 but resurges under SSPP5–8.5, with maximum moistening concentrated in central NWC. Regarding the precipitation recycling rate (ρ), the overall rate in NWC is projected to fluctuate within ±5 % under the SSP1–2.6. In contrast, it is expected to exhibit a fluctuating downward trend under the SSP5–8.5, decreasing by 1.04 % per decade and reaching nearly 5.1 % lower than the baseline period by the end of the 21st century. This indicates progressive weakening of internal cycling under high emissions. Spatially, the distribution of ρ is highly uneven. The internal cycle is expected to increase significantly in the central region of NWC due to the abnormal enhancement of evaporation, while it will gradually weaken over time in other regions. Future precipitation increases primarily derive from the combined effects of internal and external cycling, but is primarily driven by changes in external cycling precipitation (Po) through enhanced moisture transport. Moreover, under the high emission scenario, the contribution from external cycling demonstrates progressive increase, while internal cycling exhibits gradually weaken. This suggests that as climate warming accelerates in NWC, the rapid ablation of glaciers and snowmelt may lead to a transition from strengthening to weakening of the internal cycle because of the increasing ineffective evaporation. Even if the absolute precipitation increases in the future, the additional moisture may be offset by ineffective evaporation, making it difficult to convert into usable water resources. This poses a severe challenge for future water resource management in NWC."
