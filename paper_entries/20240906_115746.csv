10.1088/1748-9326/ad6a70,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究利用卫星遥感数据分析了1985年至2014年全球153个流域的水库对河流流量的影响。研究发现，全球三分之二的流域受水库调节的程度低于10%，而高度调节的流域主要分布在中亚和东亚等欠发达地区。从1985年到2014年，只有27%的流域呈现出水库调节程度上升的趋势，没有流域呈现出下降趋势。研究还发现，国内生产总值、气候缺水和径流量与水库调节程度之间存在显著的相关性。该研究为全球水资源管理提供了全球范围内的水库调节评估。,"['satellite remote sensing', 'streamflow', 'water resources management']",Dongyang Han;Pan Liu;Lu Zhang;Lei Cheng;Qian Cheng;Xiaojing Zhang;Weibo Liu;Jiabo Yin,Quantifying the impact of dams on global streamflow over the period of 1985–2014,"The number of dams globally has increased dramatically over the past few decades, providing reliable water resources by regulating natural streamflow. However, assessing the impact of dams on natural streamflow at a large scale remains a challenge due to lack of dam storage variation data. Here we analyzed flow regulation by dams from 1985 to 2014 over 153 basins globally using satellite remote sensing data. Two-thirds of global basins are regulated below 10%, and the high degree of regulation is mainly distributed in underdeveloped regions such as Central Asia and East Asia. Only 27% of basins have an increasing regulation trend from 1985 to 2014 and no basins show a decreasing trend. The gross domestic production, climatic water deficit and runoff show significant correlations with the flow regulation. We provide a global scale assessment of flow regulation by dams to support global water resources management."

A global long short-term memory (LSTM) model, using data from multiple basins, can enhance streamflow prediction, yet acquiring detailed basin attributes remains a challenge. To overcome this, we introduce the Geo-vision transformer (ViT)-LSTM model, a novel approach that enriches LSTM predictions by integrating basin attributes derived from remote sensing with a ViT architecture. Applied to 531 basins across the Contiguous United States, our method demonstrated superior prediction accuracy in both temporal and spatiotemporal extrapolation scenarios. Geo-ViT-LSTM marks a significant advancement in land surface modeling, providing a more comprehensive and effective tool for better understanding the environment responses to climate change."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7045,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注英国土壤水分干旱的未来变化趋势，利用 JULES 土地表面模型、COSMOS-UK 观测网络和 UKCP18 气候预测数据，评估了未来土壤水分状况。论文重点研究了土壤水分干旱事件的频率和强度变化，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['soil moisture', 'land surface model', 'climate projections', 'drought', 'UK']",Magdalena Szczykulska;Chris Huntingford;Elizabeth Cooper;Jonathan G Evans,Future increases in soil moisture drought frequency at UK monitoring sites: merging the JULES land model with observations and convection-permitting UK climate projections,"Concerns exist about the viability of food security across Europe due to multiple, potentially adverse drivers. These include economic, political and climate forcing factors, all of which require quantification. Here, we focus on the climate forcing, and in particular, the soil moisture change component which crucially determines water availability for crop uptake. We estimate future soil moisture levels at 34 sites of the UK COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS-UK) network. We do this by combining three platforms: the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model, field-scale soil moisture observations from the COSMOS-UK stations and 2.2 km convection-permitting UK Climate Projections (UKCP18). We use COSMOS-UK data to optimise key soil moisture-related parameters in the JULES model, based on its performance in the contemporary period. We then force the calibrated model with UKCP18 data to produce future soil moisture estimates. We evaluate the modelled soil moisture for an average soil depth between 0 and 35 cm to match the depth of soil moisture observations. Our main conclusions concern future soil moisture droughts which we compare with equivalent events in the historical period, 1982–2000. We find that on average across all sites, there is an increase in the frequency of future extreme soil moisture drought events of duration above 90 days. In 2062–80, such frequency increase of between 0.1 and 0.6 events per year (equivalent to at least 2 and up to 12 additional events in a 20-year period) is expected. We also show that, in 2062–80, there is an increased risk of high or more intense soil moisture drought conditions in months between May and November, with months between June and October being at especially high risk. The UKCP18 data corresponds to a high-emissions future described by the RCP8.5 scenario."

Solely relying on the analysis of satellite-observed Chl poses challenges in determining the phytoplankton response to mesoscale eddies. To address this, our study takes a collaborative approach, utilizing satellite-derived sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) and chlorophyll anomalies (CHLA) to comprehensively investigate the dynamical-biological processes associated with eddies in the subtropical and mid-latitude North Atlantic. In the subtropics, the patterns in CHLA and SSTA predominantly exhibit a dipole nature, with the dipole component providing more than 70% of the explained variance (EV). This suggests that eddy stirring is the dominant mechanism driving the observed anomaly patterns. Conversely, in the mid-latitudes, the monopole components (TM) explain more than 60% of the EV, implying a more influential role for eddy trapping and vertical modulations. The signs of the TM of eddy SSTA persist throughout their lifetime, being consistent with the lowering (raising) of isopycnals within AEs (CEs). However, the subtropical CHLA response is higher in AEs than CEs, indicating additional factors, such as eddy-induced Ekman pumping and/or mixing to a deeper level may be important. This finding is also corroborated by subsurface observations from Argo floats. At mid-latitudes, there is a clear inverse correspondence between the CHLA and mixed layer depth. In contrast, no significant correlation is observed in the subtropics, except during winter when a positive relationship emerges. These patterns suggest that phytoplankton exhibit highly diverse responses to the physical dynamics associated with eddies. Our work offers a method to estimate eddy dynamical-biological impacts on phytoplankton using satellite products, compensating for the limitations of in-situ observations. It also reveals potential contributions to marine primary production, global carbon cycles, and the development of biogeochemical models."

We examine RSR characteristics from latitude and month perspectives, revealing decreased trends observed by CERES in both hemispheres driven by clear-sky atmospheric and cloud components at 30–50° N and cloud components at 0–50° S. AVHRR achieves symmetry criteria within uncertainty and is suitable for the long-term analysis of hemispheric RSR symmetry. 
 Averaging reflected solar radiation (RSR) over the whole year/hemisphere may mask the inter-month-/region-specific signals, limiting the investigation of spatiotemporal mechanisms and hemispheric symmetry projections. This drives us to explain RSR characteristics from latitude- and month-based perspectives. The study also explores whether longer-record radiation datasets can exhibit hemispheric symmetry of RSR to understand its temporal changes. Statistics indicate that the largest trends in decreasing RSR in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (NH and SH) occur in mid-spring and are dominated by clear-sky atmospheric and cloud components and cloud components only, respectively. The interannual negative trend in the NH RSR mainly derives from 30–50° N latitude zones, attributed to the decrease in the clear-sky atmospheric component caused by reduced anthropogenic sulfate emissions and spring/summer dust frequencies and reduced cloud fraction caused by increased sea surface temperature and an unstable marine boundary layer, thus leading to a reduced cloud component. In the SH, the significant RSR decreasing trend is widespread in 0–50° S latitude zones, which is closely related to the decrease in the cloud component caused by the decrease in cloud cover over the tropical western Pacific and Southern Ocean, partially compensated by the increase in the clear-sky atmospheric component. A new data evaluation system and an uncertainty analysis reveal that only the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) outperforms in exhibiting the Cloud and Earth Radiant Energy System (CERES) hemispheric RSR differences due to offsetting biases among different components and achieves hemispheric RSR symmetry criteria within its uncertainty, making it suitable for studying long-term RSR hemispheric symmetry changes. Furthermore, the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) agrees well with CERES regarding hemispheric cloud component asymmetry and can help in the study of the corresponding long-term changes and mechanisms."

Utilizing a self-built vertical observation system, a direct net photochemical O3 production rate detection system, and an observation-based model, we diagnosed the vertical distributions and formation mechanism of net photochemical O3 production rates and sensitivity in the Pearl River Delta region, one of the most O3-polluted areas in China. 
 Understanding the near-ground vertical and temporal photochemical O3 formation mechanism is important to mitigate O3 pollution. Here, we measured the vertical profiles of O3 and its precursors at six different heights, ranging from 5 to 335 m, using a newly built vertical observation system in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. The net photochemical ozone production rate (P(O3)net) and O3 formation sensitivities at various heights were diagnosed using an observation-based model coupled with the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3.3.1). Moreover, to assess model performance and identify the causative factors behind O3 pollution episodes, the P(O3)net was measured at 5 m above ground level with a custom-built detection system. In total, three O3 pollution episodes and two non-episodes were captured. The identified O3 pollution episodes were found to be jointly influenced by both photochemical production and physical transport, with local photochemical reactions playing a major role. The high index of agreement (IOA) calculated by comparing the modelled and measured P(O3)net values indicated the rationality of investigating the vertical and temporal variability in O3 formation mechanisms using model results. However, the measured P(O3)net values were generally higher than the modelled P(O3)net values, particularly under high-NOx conditions, which may indicate a potential underestimation of total RO2 by the model. Throughout the measurement period, the contribution of different reaction pathways to O3 production remained consistent across various heights, with HO2 + NO as the major O3 production pathway, followed by RO2 + NO. We observed that P(O3)net decreased with an increase in measurement height, which was primarily attributed to the reduction in O3 precursors, such as oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs). The O3 formation regimes were similar at different heights during both episodes and non-episodes, either being located in the VOC-sensitive regime or in the transition regime that is more sensitive to VOCs. Diurnally, photochemical O3 formation typically remained in the VOC-sensitive regime during the morning and noon, but it transitioned to the transition regime and was more sensitive to VOCs in the afternoon at around 16:00 LT (local time). Vertical and temporal photochemical O3 formation is most sensitive to OVOCs, suggesting that targeting specific VOCs for control measures is more practical and feasible at the observation site. The vertical temporal analysis of O3 formation mechanisms near the ground surface in this study provides critical foundational knowledge that can be used to formulate effective short-term emergency and long-term control strategies to combat O3 pollution in the PRD region of China."

Pandis;Konstantinos Eleftheriadis;Alexandros Papayannis;Athanasios Nenes,Drivers of droplet formation in east Mediterranean orographic clouds,"Analysis of modeling, in situ, and remote sensing measurements reveals the microphysical state of orographic clouds and their response to aerosol from the boundary layer and free troposphere. We show that cloud response to aerosol is robust, as predicted supersaturation and cloud droplet number levels agree with those determined from in-cloud measurements. The ability to determine if clouds are velocity- or aerosol-limited allows for novel model constraints and remote sensing products. 
 The purpose of this study is to understand the drivers of cloud droplet formation in orographic clouds. We used a combination of modeling, in situ,  and remote sensing measurements at the high-altitude Helmos Hellenic Atmospheric Aerosol and Climate Change ((HAC)2) station, which is located at the top of Mt. Helmos (1314 m above sea level), Greece,  during the Cloud–AerosoL InteractionS in the Helmos Background TropOsphere (CALISHTO) campaign in fall 2021 (https://calishto.panacea-ri.gr/, last access: 1 August 2024) to examine the origins of the aerosols (i.e., local aerosol from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) or long-range-transported aerosol from the free-tropospheric layer (FTL) contributing to the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)), their characteristics (hygroscopicity, size distribution,  and mixing state), and the vertical velocity distributions and resulting supersaturations.We found that the characteristics of the PBL aerosol were considerably different from FTL aerosol and use the aerosol particle number and equivalent mass concentration of the black carbon (eBC) in order to determine when (HAC)2 was within the FTL or PBL based on time series of the height of the PBL. During the (HAC)2 cloud events we sample a mixture of interstitial aerosol and droplet residues, which we characterize using a new approach that utilizes the in situ droplet measurements to determine time periods when the aerosol sample is purely interstitial. From the dataset we determine the properties (size distribution and hygroscopicity) of the pre-cloud, activated, and interstitial aerosol. The hygroscopicity of activated aerosol is found to be higher than that of the interstitial or pre-cloud aerosol. A series of closure studies with the droplet parameterization shows that cloud droplet concentration (Nd) and supersaturation can be predicted to within 25 % of observations when the aerosol size distributions correspond to pre-cloud conditions. The analysis of the characteristic supersaturation of each aerosol population indicates that droplet formation in clouds is aerosol-limited when formed in FTL air masses – hence droplet formation is driven by aerosol variations, while clouds formed in the PBL tend to be velocity-limited and droplet variations are driven by fluctuations in vertical velocity. Given that the cloud dynamics do not vary significantly between air masses, the variation in aerosol concentration and type is mostly responsible for these shifts in cloud microphysical state and sensitivity to aerosol. With these insights, the remote sensing of cloud droplets in such clouds can be used to infer either CCN spectra (when in the FTL) or vertical velocity (when in the PBL). In conclusion, we show that a coordinated measurement of aerosol and cloud properties, together with the novel analysis approaches presented here,  allows for the determination of the drivers of droplet formation in orographic clouds and their sensitivity to aerosol and vertical velocity variations."

A sensitivity analysis regarding cloud phase and related cloud properties,"This study uses radiative transfer calculations to characterize the relation of two satellite channel combinations (namely infrared window brightness temperature differences – BTDs – of SEVIRI) to the thermodynamic cloud phase. A sensitivity analysis reveals the complex interplay of cloud parameters and their contribution to the observed phase dependence of BTDs. This knowledge helps to design optimal cloud-phase retrievals and to understand their potential and limitations. 
 This study investigates the sensitivity of two brightness temperature differences (BTDs) in the infrared (IR) window of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) to various cloud parameters in order to understand their information content, with a focus on cloud thermodynamic phase. To this end, this study presents radiative transfer calculations, providing an overview of the relative importance of all radiatively relevant cloud parameters, including thermodynamic phase, cloud-top temperature (CTT), optical thickness (τ), effective radius (Reff), and ice crystal habit. By disentangling the roles of cloud absorption and scattering, we are able to explain the relationships of the BTDs to the cloud parameters through spectral differences in the cloud optical properties. In addition, an effect due to the nonlinear transformation from radiances to brightness temperatures contributes to the specific characteristics of the BTDs and their dependence on τ and CTT. We find that the dependence of the BTDs on phase is more complex than sometimes assumed. Although both BTDs are directly sensitive to phase, this sensitivity is comparatively small in contrast to other cloud parameters. Instead, the primary link between phase and the BTDs lies in their sensitivity to CTT (or more generally the surface–cloud temperature contrast), which is associated with phase. One consequence is that distinguishing high ice clouds from low liquid clouds is straightforward, but distinguishing mid-level ice clouds from mid-level liquid clouds is challenging. These findings help to better understand and improve the working principles of phase retrieval algorithms."

Wenger;Stig Hellebust,Spatial analysis of PM2.5 using a concentration similarity index applied to air quality sensor networks,"This study presents the concentration similarity index (CSI) for a quantitative and robust comparison of PM2.5 measurements within air quality sensor networks. Developed and tested on two Irish sensor networks, the CSI revealed real spatial variations in PM2.5 and enables assessment of the representativeness of regulatory monitoring locations. It underscores the impact of solid fuel combustion on PM2.5 and highlights the importance of wintertime data for accurate exposure assessments. 
 Air quality sensor (AQS) networks are useful for mapping PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of 2.5 µm or smaller) in urban environments, but quantitative assessment of the observed spatial and temporal variation is currently underdeveloped. This study introduces a new metric – the concentration similarity index (CSI) – to facilitate a quantitative and time-averaged comparison of the concentration–time profiles of PM2.5 measured by each sensor within an air quality sensor network. Following development on a dataset with minimal unexplained variation and robust tests, the CSI function is used to represent an unbiased and fair depiction of the air quality variation within an area covered by a monitoring network. The measurement data is used to derive a CSI value for every combination of sensor pairs in the network, yielding valuable information on spatial variation in PM2.5. This new method is applied to two separate AQS networks, in Dungarvan and in the city of Cork, Ireland. In Dungarvan there was a lower mean CSI value (x‾CSI, Dungarvan=0.61, x‾CSI, Cork=0.71), indicating lower overall similarity between locations in the network. In both networks, the average diurnal plots for each sensor exhibit an evening peak in PM2.5 concentration due to emissions from residential solid-fuel burning; however, there is considerable variation in the size of this peak. Clustering techniques applied to the CSI matrices identify two different location types in each network; locations in central or residential areas that experience more pollution from solid-fuel burning and locations on the edge of the urban areas that experience cleaner air. The difference in mean PM2.5 between these two location types was 6 µg m−3 in Dungarvan and 2 µg m−3 in Cork. Furthermore, the examination of winter and summer months (January and May) indicates that higher PM2.5 levels during periods of increased residential solid-fuel burning act as a major driver for greater differences (lower similarity indices) between locations in both networks, with differences in mean seasonal CSI values exceeding 0.25 and differences in mean seasonal PM2.5 exceeding 7 µg m−3. These findings underscore the importance of including wintertime PM data in analyses, as the differences between locations is enhanced during periods when solid-fuel burning activities are at a peak. Additionally, the CSI method facilitates the assessment of the representativeness of the PM2.5 measured at regulatory air quality monitoring locations with respect to population exposure, showing here that location type is more important than physical proximity in terms of similarity and spatial representativeness assessments. Applying the CSI in this manner can allow for the placement of monitoring infrastructure to be optimised. The results indicate that the population exposure to PM2.5 in Dungarvan is moderately represented (x‾CSI=0.63) by the current regulatory monitoring location, and the regulatory monitoring location assessed in Cork represented the city-wide PM2.5 levels well (x‾CSI=0.76)."

Our corrected GEMS product combines the high data density of GEMS with the accuracy of TROPOMI, supporting the combined use for analyses of East Asia air quality including emissions and chemistry. This method can be extended to other species and geostationary satellites including TEMPO and Sentinel-4. 
 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) launched in February 2020 is now providing continuous daytime hourly observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns over eastern Asia (5° S–45° N, 75–145° E) with 3.5 × 7.7 km2 pixel resolution. These data provide unique information to improve understanding of the sources, chemistry, and transport of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with implications for atmospheric chemistry and air quality, but opportunities for direct validation are very limited. Here we correct the operational level-2 (L2) NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from GEMS with a machine learning (ML) model to match the much sparser but more mature observations from the low Earth orbit TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), preserving the data density of GEMS but making them consistent with TROPOMI. We first reprocess the GEMS and TROPOMI operational L2 products to use common prior vertical NO2 profiles (shape factors) from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. This removes a major inconsistency between the two satellite products and greatly improves their agreement with ground-based Pandora NO2 VCD data in source regions. We then apply the ML model to correct the remaining differences, Δ(GEMS–TROPOMI), using the GEMS NO2 VCDs and retrieval parameters as predictor variables. We train the ML model with colocated GEMS and TROPOMI NO2 VCDs, taking advantage of TROPOMI off-track viewing to cover the wide range of effective zenith angles (EZAs) observed by GEMS. The two most important predictor variables for Δ(GEMS–TROPOMI) are GEMS NO2 VCD and EZA. The corrected GEMS product is unbiased relative to TROPOMI and shows a diurnal variation over source regions more consistent with Pandora than the operational product."

We assess the experimental sensitivity of various functional group species and their binding energy with iodide ions in I-CIMS. A novel classification approach was introduced to significantly enhance the accuracy of semi-quantitative methods (improving R2 values from 0.52 to beyond 0.88). 
 Iodide-adduct time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometry (I-CIMS) has been developed as a powerful tool for detecting the oxidation products of volatile organic compounds. However, the accurate quantification of species that do not have generic standards remains a challenge for I-CIMS application. To accurately quantify aromatic hydrocarbon oxidation intermediates, both quantitative and semi-quantitative methods for I-CIMS were established for intermediate species. The direct quantitative experimental results reveal a correlation between sensitivity to iodide addition and the number of polar functional groups (keto groups, hydroxyl groups, and acid groups) present in the species. Leveraging the selectivity of I-CIMS for species with diverse functional groups, this study established semi-quantitative equations for four distinct categories: monophenols, monoacids, polyphenol or diacid species, and species with multiple functional groups. The proposed classification method offers a pathway to enhancing the accuracy of the semi-quantitative approach, achieving an improvement in R2 values from 0.52 to beyond 0.88. Overall, the categorized semi-quantitative method was utilized to quantify intermediates formed during the oxidation of toluene under both low-NO and high-NO conditions, revealing the differential variations in oxidation products with varying levels of NOx concentration."

 In May 2018, an unprecedented long and intense seismic-volcanic crisis broke out off the island of Mayotte (Indian Ocean) and was associated with the birth of an underwater volcano (Fani Maoré). Since then, an integrated observation network has been created (REVOSIMA), with the given objective of monitoring and better understanding underwater volcanic phenomena. Recently, an unmanned submarine glider (SeaExplorer glider) has been deployed to supplement the data obtained during a series of oceanographic surveys (MAYOBS) carried out on an annual basis. Operated by ALSEAMAR, the glider performed a continuous monitoring of 30 months of the water column from the sea surface to 1250 meters water depth with the objective to acquire hydrological properties, water currents and dissolved gas concentrations. This monitoring already showed that it is feasible and valuable to measure autonomously, continuously and at a high spatio-temporal scale, physical (temperature, salinity, ocean current) and biogeochemical parameters (O2, CH4, CO2, bubbles/droplets, vertical speeds anomalies related to droplets) over several months from a glider. In particular, innovating sensing capabilities (e.g., MINICO2, ADCP) have shown a great potential in the context of the Mayotte seismic volcano crisis, despite technical challenges (complex algorithms, sensor capabilities, etc.)."

This feature allows data to be exchanged between WRF and any other model (e.g. an ocean model) using the coupling library Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea-Ice-Soil – Model Coupling Toolkit (OASIS3-MCT). This coupling interface is designed to be non-intrusive, flexible and modular. It also offers the possibility of taking into account the nested zooms used in WRF or in the models with which it is coupled. 
 The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been widely used for various applications, especially for solving mesoscale atmospheric dynamics. Its high-order numerical schemes and nesting capability enable high spatial resolution. However, a growing number of applications are demanding more realistic simulations through the incorporation of coupling with new model compartments and an increase in the complexity of the processes considered in the model. (e.g., ocean, surface gravity wave, land-surface, chemistry...). The present paper details the development and the functionalities of the coupling interface we implemented in WRF. It uses the Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea-Ice-Soil – Model Coupling Toolkit (OASIS3-MCT) coupler, which has the advantage of being non-intrusive, efficient, and very flexible to use. OASIS3-MCT has already been implemented in many climate and regional models. This coupling interface is designed with the following baselines: (1) it is structured with a 2-level design through 2 modules: a general coupling module, and a coupler-specific module, allowing to easily add other couplers if required, (2) variables exchange, coupling frequency, and any potential time and grid transformations are controlled through an external text file, offering great flexibility, (3) the concepts of “external domains” and “coupling mask” are introduced to facilitate the exchange of fields to/from multiple sources (different models, fields from different models/grids/zooms...). Finally, two examples of applications of ocean-atmosphere coupling are proposed. The first is related to the impact of ocean surface current feedback to the atmospheric boundary layer, and the second concerns the coupling of surface gravity waves with the atmospheric surface layer."

While fungi have been reported to produce offensive odors, their contribution to T&O in drinking water remains understudied and often overlooked. In this study, the profiles of fungal community and odorants produced by 10 native fungal isolates were investigated in 36 samples collected from two drinking water treatment plants and a premise plumbing system. A total of 17 odorants were identified with Penicillium, Aspergillus, Paecilomyces, and Alternaria genera exhibiting the highest odorant yields. Significant concentrations of musty/earthy compounds were produced by these fungal isolates, such as 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) (26–256 ng/L), geosmin (10–13 ng/L), and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxy-pyrazine (IBMP) (3–13 ng/L). The high odor activity value of the odorants primarily occurred within 4 d, while toxicity continued to increase during the 8 d incubation. UV treatment in premise plumbing significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the gene read counts of Ascomycota phylum, Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Rhizopus spp., and Trichoderma spp., by 2.3–4.0 times. These findings underscore the previously underestimated role of fungi in contributing to T&O issues in drinking water and corresponding risks to consumers and indicate UV as a promising strategy for fungal control in drinking water."

A more complex behavior is observed under far-from-equilibrium conditions, including strong inhibition of calcite dissolution, development of microtopography, and near-surface incorporation of multiple monolayers (ML) of Pb2+ without precipitation of secondary phases [where 1 ML ≡ 1 Ca/20.2 Å2, the crystallographic site density of the calcite (104) lattice plane]. However, the mechanistic controls governing far-from-equilibrium reactivity are not well understood. Here, we observe the interfacial incorporation of dissolved Pb2+ during the dissolution of calcite (104) surfaces at pH ∼ 3.7 in a flow-through reaction cell, revealing the formation of a ∼1 nm thick Pb-rich calcite layer with a total Pb coverage of ∼1.4 ML. These observations of the sorbed Pb distribution used resonant anomalous X-ray reflectivity, X-ray fluorescence, and nanoinfrared atomic force microscopy. We propose that this altered surface layer represents a novel sorption mode that is stabilized by conditions of sustained disequilibrium. This behavior may significantly impact the transport of dissolved metals during disequilibrium processes occurring in acid mine drainage and subsurface CO2 injection and, if appropriately accounted for, could improve the predictive capability of geochemical reactive-transport models."

Here, we conducted a comprehensive study, using a full-scale oxic-hydrolytic and denitrification-oxic (OHO) coking wastewater treatment process as a case and developed a dynamic aeration model integrating thermodynamics and kinetics to elucidate the energy-saving mechanisms of wastewater treatment systems in response to diurnal temperature variations. Our case study results indicate that natural diurnal temperature variations can cut the energy consumption of 660,980 kWh annually (up to 30%) for the aeration unit in the OHO system.

We demonstrate that this genus has been widely detected but incorrectly classified in previous amplicon sequencing-based investigations of the drinking water microbiome. Further, we show that a single genome variant (genomovar) within this genus is detected in 75% of drinking water systems included in this study. We propose a name for this uncultured bacterium as “Raskinella chloraquaticus” and describe the genus as “Raskinella” (endorsed by SeqCode).

At the highest dose, EHDPP exposure induced ASD-like behaviors in both female and male offspring. Significant reductions in mature dendritic spines and structural damage to the postsynaptic density zone were noted in all but the lowest exposure groups, indicating postsynaptic membrane impairment. Mechanistically, EHDPP significantly downregulated disc large MAGUK scaffold protein 4 expression by inhibiting protein kinase B and type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor phosphorylation. In the heterologous synapse formation assay in vivo, EHDPP significantly reduced the levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 expression in neurons at 1 μM.

Here, we used a field survey, a reciprocal cross-transplant experiment, and a laboratory toxicity experiment to build a compelling case that exposure to the insecticide chlorpyrifos was responsible for differences in snail (Bellamya aeruginosa) densities in eastern (ELL) and western basins of Liangzi Lake in China. Our field survey and reciprocal cross-transplant experiment revealed significant differences in snail densities, juvenile percentage, survival, and relative telomere length (RTL) in the two basins. The insecticide chlorpyrifos detected in snail tissues was negatively correlated with snail densities, the percentage of juvenile snails, and RTL and had an extremely high risk quotient in ELL. In the laboratory experiment, tissue concentrations of chlorpyrifos detected in ELL were associated with reduced RTL and increased juvenile mortality in B. aeruginosa. These results support the hypothesis that chlorpyrifos exposure in ELL reduced the density of snails by reducing juvenile survival and, consequently, recruitment to the adult population."

Recently, elevated levels of reactive chlorine species during bleach cleaning and disinfection have been reported to increase indoor oxidative capacity. However, incomplete knowledge of the indoor transformation of limonene, especially the missing chlorine chemistry, poses a barrier to evaluating the environmental implications associated with the concurrent use of cleaning agents and disinfectants. Here, we investigated the reaction mechanisms of chlorinated limonene peroxy radicals (Cl-lim-RO2•), key intermediates in determining the chlorine chemistry of limonene, and toxicity of transformation products (TPs) using quantum chemical calculations and toxicology modeling. The results indicate that Cl-lim-RO2• undergoes a concerted autoxidation process modulated by RO2• and alkoxy radicals (RO•), particularly emphasizing the importance of RO• isomerization. Following this generalized autoxidation mechanism, Cl-lim-RO2• can produce low-volatility precursors of secondary organic aerosols. Toxicological findings further indicate that the majority of TPs exhibit increased respiratory toxicity, mutagenicity, and eye/skin irritation compared to limonene, presenting an occupational hazard for indoor occupants. The proposed near-explicit reaction mechanism of chlorine-initiated limonene significantly enhances our current understanding of both RO2• and RO• chemistry while also highlighting the health risks associated with the concurrent use of cleaning agents and disinfectants."

A novel catchment particle balance approach was used, incorporating inputs from atmospheric deposition and stream inflows against lake outflow and sedimentation. This approach provides the first reported observation-based estimates of microplastic residence time in freshwater lakes. Atmospheric deposition had the highest daily microplastic flux (3.95–8.09 mp/m2/day), compared to the inflow streams (2.21–2.34 mp/m2/day), suggesting that it is the dominant source of microplastics to rural regions. Approximately 44–71% of the deposited microplastics were retained in the terrestrial catchments and 30–49% of the microplastics in the stream inflows were retained in the study lakes. Given that output fluxes ranged from 0.72–3.76 mp/m2/day in the sediment and 1.18–1.66 mp/m2/day in the lake outflows, the microplastic residence time was estimated to be between 3 and 12 years, suggesting that lakes are an important reservoir for microplastics. Fibers were the dominant shape in atmospheric deposition, streamwater, and lake water; however, in lake sediment, there was a higher proportion of fragments. Across all media, poly(ethylene terephthalate) was the dominant polymer identified (23%)."

While it is traditionally assumed that the long-term aerosol pH levels are determined by the relative abundances of atmospheric alkaline to acidic substances (referred to as RC/A hereinafter), we observed contrasting pH─RC/A trends at different sites globally, i.e., rising alkali-to-acid ratios in the atmosphere may unexpectedly lead to increased aerosol acidity. Here, we examined this apparently counterintuitive phenomenon using the multiphase buffer theory. We show that the aerosol water content (AWC) set a pH “baseline” as the peak buffer pH, while the RC/A and particle-phase chemical compositions determine the deviation of pH from this baseline within the buffer ranges. Therefore, contrasting long-term pH trends may emerge when RC/A increases while the AWC or nitrate fraction decreases, or vice versa.

On average, 25.1% in species number and 26.8% in mass of the OOA species detected by the FIGAERO-CIMS in a winter campaign at an urban site in Wuhan, a megacity in central China, might be attributed to thermal decomposition fragments. Our results show that the volatility and precursor of ambient OOA differed systematically according to location, season, and pollution level. The OOA in the ocean atmosphere was characterized by high fractions of extremely low volatility organic compounds (ELVOC) and aliphatic species, while the inland urban OOA was characterized by aromatic species and fell primarily into the low volatility organic compounds (LVOCs) and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) range. The volatilities of OOA in the inland urban atmosphere in summer, pollution days, and daytime were lower than those in winter, clean days, and nighttime. When the PM episode developed from clean to particle growth and then to pollution period, the OOA species shifted from Low-Mw OOA species to Median-Mw OOA species and then to highly nonvolatile species.

It primarily manifests in the form of pulmonary nodules, but not all will develop into lung cancer. Therefore, it is highly desired to distinguish between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules for the early prevention and treatment of lung cancer. Currently, histopathological examination is the gold standard for classifying pulmonary nodules, which is invasive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. This study proposes a metallomics approach through synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) with a simplified one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) to distinguish pulmonary nodules by using serum samples. SRXRF spectra of serum samples were obtained and preliminarily analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). Subsequently, machine learning algorithms (MLs) and 1DCNN were applied to develop classification models. Both MLs and 1DCNN based on full-channel spectra could distinguish patients with benign and malignant pulmonary nodules, but the highest accuracy rate of 96.7% was achieved when using 1DCNN. In addition, it was found that characteristic elements in serum from patients with malignant nodules were different from those in benign nodules, which can serve as the fingerprint metallome profile. The simplified model based on characteristic elements resulted in good performance of sensitivity and F1-score > 91.30%, G-mean, MCC and Kappa > 85.59%, and accuracy = 94.34%. In summary, metallomic classification of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules using serum samples can be achieved through 1DCNN-boosted SRXRF, which is easy to handle and much less invasive compared to histopathological examination."

Živković,Boreal Forest Fire Causes Daytime Surface Warming During Summer to Exceed Surface Cooling During Winter in North America,"Boreal wildfires modify surface climates affecting plant physiology, permafrost thaw, and carbon fluxes. Post‐fire temperatures vary over decades because of successional vegetation changes. Yet, the underlying biophysical drivers remain uncertain. Here, we quantify surface climate changes following fire disturbances in the North American boreal forest and identify its dominant biophysical drivers. We analyze multi‐year land‐atmosphere energy exchange and satellite observations from across North America and find post‐fire daytime surface temperatures to be substantially warmer for about five decades while winter temperatures are slightly cooler. Post‐fire decadal changes are characterized by decreasing leaf area index during the first decade, by sharply increasing surface albedo during the snow cover period, and by a less efficient heat exchange between the forest and the atmosphere caused by decreasing surface roughness for about 2–3 decades. Over the first three decades, the amount of energy used for evapotranspiration increases before returning to lower values. We find that surface warming is mainly explained by less efficient forest‐atmosphere heat exchange while cooling is additionally explained by increasing surface albedo. We estimate that biome‐wide daytime surface temperatures of the Canadian boreal forest in 2024 are 0.27°C warmer in the summer and 0.02°C cooler during the winter because of fire. For a scenario with a strong increase in burned area, we estimate annual warming from fire to increase by a third until 2050. Our study highlights the potential for accelerated surface warming in the boreal biome with increasing wildfire activity and disentangles the biophysical drivers of fire‐related surface climate impacts."

Whistler mode waves play a critical role in these interactions, and up to now their properties during extreme events remained poorly sampled and understood. We employ extensive databases of spacecraft observations to specify their distribution. We show that under extreme geomagnetic conditions, lower‐band whistler mode chorus waves have a net effect of accelerating ultra‐relativistic electrons, which results in an increase of fluxes at multi‐MeV energies by several orders of magnitude.

To reduce persistent biases and improve understanding of the climate system, international groups have called for unprecedented investment in global convection–permitting (CP) climate models. It is essential such models accurately represent MCSs, and in particular environmental interactions such as dynamical control by wind shear. We show that in representative current generation CP simulations, MCS updraft entrainment decreases with shear, leading to a realistic increase of extreme rainfall. We find the control of environmental shear extends to mean storm rainfall and anvil heights. The simulation of these effects depends strongly on model physics in both CP and parameterized models. We show that in West Africa, MCS shear response influences the zonal distribution of storm diabatic heating, modifying upscale impacts of convection.

Using the data set obtained by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, we report an unusually sharp enhancement of energetic electron flux in the upstream region of Earth's bow shock, associated with a bipolar variation of the interplanetary magnetic field. To explain these observations, we propose a two‐step acceleration scenario where electrons trapped in a flux rope (FR) first undergo head‐on collisions and are further accelerated by FR contraction as the FR crosses the shock. Such a scenario can well explain the spacecraft observations. This work can improve our understanding of particle acceleration processes at shocks."

Observations from the BIO‐MAÏDO campaign, along with 2 days of high‐resolution simulation using the MesoNH model, were analyzed to understand the thermally‐driven mechanisms. This simulation was conducted with a horizontal resolution of 100 m and employed a vertically stretched grid, achieving a resolution of 1 m at the lowest levels. Two distinct wind regimes were identified, characterized by katabatic flows prevailing within a 30 m thick layer during nighttime, and an anabatic flow manifesting within a layer spanning from 150 to 200 m during the daytime. The simulation was confirmed through validation with surface measurements, and thus enabling a detailed study of thermal breeze circulations. Results reveal that the intensity of trade winds significantly influences the development of thermal circulations. Complex layered structures in the atmosphere were also identified. At an intensity of 7 m s−1, trade winds impede the development of thermal circulations atop the slope, and result in the emergence of a convergence zone between local and regional circulations. The analysis of the breeze establishment period indicates that the katabatic flow stabilizes in 35 min, quicker than the anabatic flow, which takes 110 min. Momentum and heat budget analysis provide insights into the primary drivers of thermal circulations: buoyancy acceleration, influenced by local surface heating during anabatic flow onset, and local surface cooling during katabatic flow onset."

However, the behavior of the Antarctic Ice Sheet beyond 2100 remains largely unknown: several instability mechanisms can develop on longer time scales, potentially destabilizing large parts of Antarctica. Projections of Antarctic Ice Sheet evolution until 2300 are presented here, using an ensemble of 16 ice‐flow models and forcing from global climate models. Under high‐emission scenarios, the Antarctic sea‐level contribution is limited to less than 30 cm sea‐level equivalent (SLE) by 2100, but increases rapidly thereafter to reach up to 4.4 m SLE by 2300. Simulations including ice‐shelf collapse lead to an additional 1.1 m SLE on average by 2300, and can reach 6.9 m SLE. Widespread retreat is observed on that timescale in most West Antarctic basins, leading to a collapse of large sectors of West Antarctica by 2300 in 30%–40% of the ensemble. While the onset date of retreat varies among ice models, the rate of upstream propagation is highly consistent once retreat begins. Calculations of sea‐level contribution including water density corrections lead to an additional ∼10% sea level and up to 50% for contributions accounting for bedrock uplift in response to ice loading. Overall, these results highlight large sea‐level contributions from Antarctica and suggest that the choice of ice sheet model remains the leading source of uncertainty in multi‐century projections."

Although stunting causes have been documented, we still lack a more in‐depth understanding of their local factors at a more detailed geographic level. We cross‐sectionally examined 615 height‐for‐age prevalence observations in the Northern Province of Rwanda, linked with their related covariates, to explore the spatial heterogeneity in the low height‐for‐age prevalence by fitting linear and non‐linear spatial regression models and explainable machine learning. Specifically, complemented with generalized additive models, we fitted the ordinary least squares (OLS), a standard geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models to characterize the imbalanced distribution of stunting risk factors and uncover the nonlinear effect of significant predictors, explaining the height‐for‐age variations. The results reveal that 27% of the children measured were stunted, and that likelihood was found to be higher in the districts of Musanze, Gakenke, and Gicumbi. The local MGWR model outperformed the ordinary GWR and OLS, with coefficients of determination of 0.89, 0.84, and 0.25, respectively. At specific ranges, the study shows that height‐for‐age decreases with an increase in the number of days a child was left alone, elevation, and rainfall. In contrast, land surface temperature is positively associated with height‐for‐age. However, variables like the normalized difference vegetation index, slope, soil fertility, and urbanicity exhibited bell‐shaped and U‐shaped non‐linear associations with the height‐for‐age prevalence. Identifying areas with the highest rates of stunting will help determine the most effective measures for reducing the burden of undernutrition."

 Rivers are a key component of the global carbon cycle. They receive vast quantities of terrestrial carbon, of which a large fraction is ultimately exported to the coastal ocean. Our review of previously published assessments reveals that substantial uncertainties remain with regard to the spatial distribution and speciation of the carbon export. Accurate quantification of the relative contributions of dissolved, particulate, organic and inorganic carbon to the total amounts is, however, of crucial importance for the coupling between the terrestrial and marine carbon cycles. Breaking down existing spatially explicit assessments over large river basins, we find a disagreement in flux estimates that exceeds two orders of magnitude for more than half of the basins. Using machine-learning techniques in combination with a multi-model ensemble and an updated database of observations, we overcome the inconsistencies in existing assessments and narrow down uncertainties in riverine carbon exports. Our revised assessment yields a global riverine export of 1.02 ± 0.22 (2σ) PgC yr−1. This carbon flux is partitioned into 0.52 ± 0.17, 0.30 ± 0.14, 0.18 ± 0.04 and 0.03 ± 0.02 PgC yr−1 of dissolved inorganic, dissolved organic, particulate organic and particulate inorganic carbon, respectively. We estimate the carbon contribution through groundwater export to be minor (0.016 PgC yr−1). Our assessment suggests an underestimation of the land-to-ocean carbon flux by 0.24 PgC yr−1 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and calls for a revision of the oceanic carbon budget.

 Floquet engineering is a promising tool to manipulate quantum systems coherently. A well-known example is the optical Stark effect, which has been used for optical trapping of atoms and breaking time-reversal symmetry in solids. However, as a coherent nonlinear optical effect, Floquet engineering typically requires high field intensities obtained in ultrafast pulses, severely limiting its use. Here, we demonstrate using cavity engineering of the vacuum modes to achieve orders-of-magnitude enhancement of the effective Floquet field, enabling Floquet effects at an extremely low fluence of 450 photons/μm2. At higher fluences, the cavity-enhanced Floquet effects lead to 50 meV spin and valley splitting of WSe2 excitons, corresponding to an enormous time-reversal breaking, non-Maxwellian magnetic field of over 200 T. Utilizing such an optically controlled effective magnetic field, we demonstrate an ultrafast, picojoule chirality XOR gate. These results suggest that cavity-enhanced Floquet engineering may enable the creation of steady-state or quasi-equilibrium Floquet bands, strongly non-perturbative modifications of materials beyond the reach of other means, and application of Floquet engineering to a wide range of materials and applications.

 The artificial photocatalytic synthesis based on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for H2O2 production is evolving rapidly. However, the simultaneous production of high-value products at electron and hole sites remains a great challenge. Here, we use transformable potassium iodide to obtain semi-crystalline g-C3N4 integrated with the I-/I3- redox shuttle mediators for efficient generation of H2O2 and benzaldehyde. The system demonstrates a prominent catalytic efficiency, with a benzaldehyde yield of 0.78 mol g−1 h−1 and an H2O2 yield of 62.52 mmol g−1 h−1. Such a constructed system can achieve an impressive 96.25% catalytic selectivity for 2e- oxygen reduction, surpassing previously reported systems.

This study presents an ingestible hydrogel microparticle technology that can lessen the detrimental effects of toxicity from the imidacloprid pesticide. 
 Bees provide crucial pollination services for crop cultivation, contributing billions of dollars to the global agricultural economy. However, exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids represents a major problem for bee health, necessitating strategies that can improve agricultural sustainability and pollinator health. Here we report a simple and scalable solution, through ingestible hydrogel microparticles (IHMs), which can capture neonicotinoids in vitro and in the bee gastrointestinal tract to mitigate the harmful effects of pesticides. Using the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) as a model species and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, we demonstrated by means of lethal and sublethal assays the substantial benefits of IHM treatments. Under lethal exposure of imidacloprid, bumblebees that received IHM treatment exhibited a 30% increase in survival relative to groups without IHM treatment. After a sublethal exposure of 5 ng, IHM treatment resulted in improved feeding motivation and a 44% increase in the number of bees that engaged in locomotor activity. Wingbeat frequency was significantly lower after a single 5 or 10 ng imidacloprid dose; however, IHM treatment improved wingbeat frequency. Overall, the IHMs improved bumblebee health, and with further optimization have the potential to benefit apiculture and reduce risk during crop pollination by managed bees.

 Significant strides have been made in understanding El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics, yet its long-lead prediction remains challenging, especially for the El Niño events after 2000. Sea surface salinity (SSS) is known to affect ENSO development and intensity by influencing ocean stratification and heat redistribution and therefore, when combined with sea surface temperature (SST) data, can potentially enhance ENSO forecast skill. In this study, we develop a deep learning (DL) model that incorporates a multiscale-pyramid structure and spatiotemporal feature extraction blocks, and the model successfully extends effective ENSO forecast lead time to 24 months for 2000–2021 with reduced effect of the spring predictability barrier (SPB). Interpretable methods are then applied to reveal the time-dependent roles of SST and SSS in ENSO forecast. More specifically, SST is critical for short-medium lead forecasts (<1 year), while SSS is important for medium-long lead forecasts (>6 months). Furthermore, we track global SST and SSS spatiotemporal shifts related to subsequent ENSO development, highlighting the importance of ocean inter-basin and tropics-extratropics interactions.

 Methane is a potent but relatively short-lived greenhouse gas, with anthropogenic and natural sources and rapidly increasing atmospheric concentrations. Hence, it is an important target for reducing emissions and increasing sinks, as doing so could notably reduce rates of climate change in the near-term. This includes potentially enhancing methanotrophy, a microbial process of methane oxidation that occurs broadly in aquatic environments, in soils and on foliar and bark surfaces. Methanotrophy can be an important sink where it intercepts relatively high concentrations of methane produced from within soils or water bodies, but when methanotrophs are exposed to only ambient atmospheric methane concentrations (about 2 ppm), methane oxidation occurs at very slow rates. Here we present an assessment of possible strategies – including introduction of exogenous microbes to soils and plant tissues, improved tillage and nutrient management in agriculture, and reforestation – to enhance rates of methanotrophy for removal of atmospheric methane, where the low concentration constrains the energy available to support methanotrophic growth.

 Speleothem trace element records can provide seasonal resolution climate reconstructions, but the interpretation can be challenging. Aragonite samples are understudied compared to calcite samples, despite that aragonite has 10x higher uranium concentrations and thus provide excellent dating precision. Here we present a high-resolution dataset of drip water trace elements (calcium, magnesium, strontium, barium, uranium) that are commonly affected by prior carbonate (calcite / aragonite) precipitation, a process often driven by effective rainfall. Our data suggest that prior calcite and aragonite precipitation can occur at the same drip site complicating the interpretation of strontium and uranium concentrations in aragonite speleothems. However, both processes can be distinguished with the “Sinclair test” through the trendline analysis of logarithmic relationships. Furthermore, our data show that aragonite speleothems slowly growing under relatively constant conditions are ideal to record variations in prior carbonate precipitation with its barium concentrations, independent from the prior carbonate precipitation mode.

 Volcanic CO2 is widely acknowledged as an important geochemical precursor for volcanic activity; however, obtaining observations through remote sensing remains a challenge. It is well established that volcanic CO2 diffusely degases during magma ascent, and the volatiles interact with the ecosystem on the surface through CO2 fertilization, which can improve vegetation health. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a remote sensing method that quantifies vegetation health. This study compared NDVI signals from Landsat 8, MODIS, Sentinel 2, and VIIRS to soil CO2 flux signals from 5 ground-based EtnaGas stations on Mt. Etna from 2011 to 2018. Due to variances in sensor and spectral characteristics, the NDVI values were calibrated across all 4 sensors. The 2nd derivatives of NDVI and soil CO2 flux highlight the timeframes of the increase/decrease cycles of CO2 degassing, which in turn, correspond to the change in storage levels as magma rises from an intermediate chamber to a shallow one. Between 2017 and 2018, the 2nd derivative spikes showed 16 magma recharge events in both NDVI and soil CO2 signals. A flank analysis of homogenous trees across Mt. Etna showed the same 2nd derivative spike pattern for NDVI when compared to individual EtnaGas stations, indicating that trees do not have to be located within 30 m of volcano-tectonic structures to be affected by diffusely escaping volcanic CO2. This study highlights the potential of NDVI as a remote sensing method for monitoring volcanic CO2 emissions, paving the way for innovative approaches to volcanic surveillance."

 Although wetlands are widely recognized for thier important role in providing ecosystem services, their abundance, spatial extent, and condition remain poorly constrained and at-risk of decline. Accurate mapping and monitoring are therefore essential for their protection. However, distinguishing swamps from upland forests and shrublands is especially challenging because optical sensors cannot detect water and/or saturated soil under dense canopies. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers distinct advantages in this regard: (1) under certain conditions, microwaves can penetrate vegetation and provide a strong backscattered signal from double bounce when surface water or very wet soil are present, and (2) microwaves can penetrate clouds, providing an opportunity to monitor changes in moisture or the extent of flooding through time. In spite of these advantages, users may still find it difficult to know which wavelengths, incidence angles, polarization states, and times of year can be used to detect swamps because of the complexity of choices, and some confusing and conflicting results presented in the literature. The goal of this research was therefore to better elucidate the impacts of sensor and environmental characteristics on the seasonal backscattering behaviour observed in and separability between swamps and dry, upland forests and shrublands, as well as determine the need for additional ancillary data like digital elevation models and derivatives to improve mapping accuracy. Using SAR data from three sensors with two different wavelengths, various polarization states, and a range of incidence angles we: (1) investigate the drivers of variations in seasonal trends and the frequency and timing of changes among different SAR time series, and assess their impact on separability, (2) quantify the importance of acquisition timing, type, number of derivatives on the accuracy of Random Forest models.

10.1016/j.jag.2024.104140,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,该研究主要关注利用高光谱影像提取海岸泥滩。研究提出了一个泥滩指数（MFI），通过放大泥滩与其他土地覆盖类型之间的光谱差异，有效区分了泥滩、盐沼、红树林和泥水。研究使用ZY1-02D、GF-5、PRISMA和Hyperion等卫星数据，并与SVM和RF等机器学习方法进行比较，证明了MFI方法在提取泥滩方面具有更高的精度和效率。,"['hyperspectral images', 'mudflat', 'coastal', 'remote sensing', 'ZY1-02D', 'GF-5', 'PRISMA', 'Hyperion', 'Support Vector Machine', 'Random Forest']",Gang Yang;Chunchen Shao;Yangyan Zuo;Weiwei Sun;Ke Huang;Lihua Wang;Binjie Chen;Xiangchao Meng;Yong Ge,MFI: A mudflat index based on hyperspectral satellite images for mapping coastal mudflats,"•The MFI (Mudflat index) has been constructed for extracting coastal mudflat. •The decision tree model was designed by combining NDVI and prior knowledge. •The proposed method is suitable for fast and effective extraction of mudflats in coastal areas. 
 China’s coastal mudflats, threatened by artificial reclamation and climate change, are undergoing drastic changes and their accurate mapping is important for their conservation and restoration. Traditional classification methods, which require large samples and complex classifiers, tend to have low computational efficiency and poor generalization ability; thus, they are unsuitable for the rapid and accurate extraction of coastal mudflats. This study proposes a Mudflat Index (MFI) based on hyperspectral images. MFI amplifies the difference in spectral characteristics between mudflats and other land cover types in intertidal environments, effectively improving the discrimination between coastal mudflats, salt marshes, mangroves, and muddy waters. Four typical coastal mudflat areas (i.e., the Yellow River Delta in Shandong, the Radial Sand Ridges of the South Yellow Sea in Jiangsu, Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang, and the Qinzhou Bay-Nanliu River Estuary in Guangxi) based on ZY1-02D were selected as the study areas. The extraction accuracies in the four study areas are 97.60%, 96.88%, 97.16% and 96.97%, respectively. The further extraction experiments were calculated based on hyperspectral data from GF-5, PRISMA, and Hyperion. Sample datasets were produced using field surveys and Google Earth high-resolution imagery. Compared to the Hyperspectral Bare Soil Index (HBSI), Normalized Difference Bare Soil Index (NDBSI) and Microphytobenthos Index (MPBI), MFI demonstrates superior performance with average SDI value improvements of 0.82, 0.71 and 1.17, respectively, in distinguishing mudflats from other typical land cover types in the intertidal zone. The extraction results were also compared with those derived from Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifications, showing that MFI outperformed SVM and RF by an average of 1.52% and 0.58%. The results show that MFI can be applied to different hyperspectral remote sensing images and different areas of mudflat extraction. The MFI-based method is simple, fast and accurate at extracting the mudflat in the intertidal environment."

Bratley;Curtis E. Woodcock,Estimating the expansion and reduction of agricultural extent in Egypt using Landsat time series,"•Mapped and estimated the spatial-temporal dynamics of agricultural extent in Egypt from 1987 to 2019. •Observed agricultural expansion along the Nile Valley and Delta, offset by urban growth and field abandonment. •The LandTrendr time-series algorithm and various masking techniques were used to map agricultural change. •Results highlight land-cover insights in Egypt, stressing the need for sustainable land-use policies. 
 Increasing population and the consequent rise in the demand for food and water resources pose significant challenges for the future of agriculture in Egypt. Rapid large-scale agricultural expansion has occurred in the country to meet the growing demand, but agricultural loss from urban infringement and field abandonment remains prevalent. Documenting the full spectrum of changes within Egypt’s agricultural systems is crucial for developing effective land-use policies that improve food security. Here we map and estimate the areal extent of multiple types of agricultural change in Egypt (i.e., agricultural gain, agricultural abandonment, and agricultural loss from urban growth) by applying the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm, a widely used time series temporal segmentation algorithm. First, we used LandTrendr to identify areas of agricultural gain and loss throughout Egypt from 1987 to 2019. Second, we combined land-cover maps and the LandTrendr results to create a comprehensive land-cover change map. Lastly, we evaluated the accuracy of our findings and estimated per-class areas with quantified uncertainty using high-quality reference data. Our results reveal a notable expansion in Egypt’s agricultural land area. However, this growth is accompanied by the widespread loss of prime agricultural land, a consequence of urban development and agricultural abandonment. This study emphasizes the pressing need for the implementation of sustainable land-use policies in Egypt, particularly as climate change will exacerbate pressures on the agricultural sector in the future."

 Continuous operating reference station (CORS) networks, underpinned by GNSS technology, support various technological services including comprehensive surveying, navigation, and remote sensing. The stability of these CORS networks is crucial for maintaining the high accuracy and reliability of data services. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the GPS deformation array of Vancouver Island, Canada, and present a thorough stability analysis scheme for CORS networks that is adaptable to other areas with frequent tectonic activity. For this study, we first conducted a data quality assessment based on three primary indices — namely, multipath effect on L1 and L2 frequency, signal-to-noise ratio in both frequency and cycle slip ratio — using the Transfer Edit Quality Check (TEQC) software. Then, we achieved high-precision data processing using the GAMIT/GLOBK software, in order to quantify the changes at each station over the specific periods. Seasonality analysis was also incorporated into the pipeline. Considering the potential variances affecting the deformation array over time, the coordinates were transformed under a unified reference frame, enabling the study of changes with station coordinates from different epochs under the same systematic conditions. Additionally, the impact of plate tectonic was examined through correlation analysis. The results showed that, while the observation data from the QUAD station in the island deformation array are of poor quality, relative stability was maintained within the deformation array. The PTRF and CLRS stations exhibited vertical instability in the fall season, while the QUAD station showed a weaker instability trend. The remaining stations maintained good stability with closer stations demonstrating stronger consistency in their displacement. In terms of plate tectonic, the deformation array stations exhibit a similar southwestward displacement trend as the North American Plate in the horizontal direction, but no significant trend in the vertical direction."

 Accurate lane maps with semantics are crucial for various applications, such as high-definition maps (HD Maps), intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and digital twins. Manual annotation of lanes is labor-intensive and costly, prompting researchers to explore automatic lane extraction methods. This paper presents an end-to-end large-scale lane mapping method that considers both lane geometry and semantics. This study represents lane markings as polylines with uniformly sampled points and associated semantics, allowing for adaptation to varying lane shapes. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end network to extract lane polylines from mobile laser scanning (MLS) data, enabling the inference of vectorized lane instances without complex post-processing. The network consists of three components: a feature encoder, a column proposal generator, and a lane information decoder. The feature encoder encodes textual and structural information of lane markings to enhance the method’s robustness to data imperfections, such as varying lane intensity, uneven point density, and occlusion-induced incomplete data. The column proposal generator generates regions of interest for the subsequent decoder. Leveraging the embedded multi-scale features from the feature encoder, the lane decoder effectively predicts lane polylines and their associated semantics without requiring step-by-step conditional inference. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three lane datasets have demonstrated the performance of the proposed method, even in the presence of incomplete data and complex lane topology. Furthermore, the datasets used in this work, including source ground points, generated bird’s eye view (BEV) images, and annotations, will be publicly available with the publication of the paper. The code and dataset will be accessible through here."

Here, we describe computationally guided transition metal–ligand design that positions a hydrogen-bond acceptor anion at the reactive site to promote functionalization. A general cross-coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary aliphatic alcohols with terminal olefins to furnish >130 ethers is achieved. The mild conditions tolerate functionality that is prone to substitution, elimination, and epimerization and achieve site selectivity in polyol settings. Mechanistic studies support the hypothesis that the ligand’s geometry and electronics direct positioning of the phosphate anion at the π-allyl-palladium terminus, facilitating the phosphate’s hydrogen-bond acceptor role toward the alcohol. Ligand-directed counteranion positioning in cationic transition metal catalysis has the potential to be a general strategy for promoting challenging bimolecular reactivity."

Hui Shen",Single-cell chromatin accessibility reveals malignant regulatory programs in primary human cancers,"To identify cancer-associated gene regulatory changes, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility landscapes across eight tumor types as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Tumor chromatin accessibility is strongly influenced by copy number alterations that can be used to identify subclones, yet underlying cis-regulatory landscapes retain cancer type–specific features. Using organ-matched healthy tissues, we identified the “nearest healthy” cell types in diverse cancers, demonstrating that the chromatin signature of basal-like–subtype breast cancer is most similar to secretory-type luminal epithelial cells. Neural network models trained to learn regulatory programs in cancer revealed enrichment of model-prioritized somatic noncoding mutations near cancer-associated genes, suggesting that dispersed, nonrecurrent, noncoding mutations in cancer are functional. Overall, these data and interpretable gene regulatory models for cancer and healthy tissue provide a framework for understanding cancer-specific gene regulation."

Modifying skin identity has clinical potential, such as the conversion of residual limb and stump (nonvolar) skin of amputees to pressure-responsive palmoplantar (volar) skin to enhance prosthesis use and minimize skin breakdown. Greater keratin 9 (KRT9) expression, higher epidermal thickness, keratinocyte cytoplasmic size, collagen length, and elastin are markers of volar skin and likely contribute to volar skin resiliency. Given fibroblasts’ capacity to modify keratinocyte differentiation, we hypothesized that volar fibroblasts influence these features. Bioprinted skin constructs confirmed the capacity of volar fibroblasts to induce volar keratinocyte features. A clinical trial of healthy volunteers demonstrated that injecting volar fibroblasts into nonvolar skin increased volar features that lasted up to 5 months, highlighting a potential cellular therapy."

However, whether it shapes coping strategies when facing future threats remains unknown. We found that mice that briefly observe a conspecific being harmed become resilient, withstanding behavioral despair after an adverse experience. Photometric recordings during negative emotional contagion revealed increased serotonin (5-HT) release in the lateral habenula. Whereas 5-HT and emotional contagion reduced habenular burst firing, limiting 5-HT synthesis prevented burst plasticity. Enhancing raphe-to-habenula 5-HT was sufficient to recapitulate resilience. In contrast, reducing 5-HT release in the habenula made witnessing a conspecific in distress ineffective to promote the resilient phenotype after adversity. These findings reveal that 5-HT supports vicarious emotions and leads to resilience by tuning definite patterns of habenular neuronal activity."

This Review highlights climate change as an additional amplifier of agriculture’s environmental impacts, by reducing agricultural productivity, reducing the efficacy of agrochemicals, increasing soil erosion, accelerating the growth and expanding the range of crop diseases and pests, and increasing land clearing. We identify multiple pathways through which climate change intensifies agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, creating a potentially powerful climate change–reinforcing feedback loop. The challenges raised by climate change underscore the urgent need to transition to sustainable, climate-resilient agricultural systems. This requires investments that both accelerate adoption of proven solutions that provide multiple benefits, and that discover and scale new beneficial processes and food products."
