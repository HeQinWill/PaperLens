10.1088/1748-9326/ad80af,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是可持续发展目标（SDGs）和巴黎气候目标的实现途径，探讨了经济驱动创新、有韧性的社区和全球公共资源管理三种不同的可持续发展路径。研究使用集成评估模型和部门模型对这些路径进行了量化比较，评估了其对人类发展、气候变化和环境的影响。虽然研究涉及能源和食物消费模式的变化，以及对碳排放和生物多样性的影响，但并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。因此，这篇论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,[],Bjoern Soergel;Sebastian Rauner;Vassilis Daioglou;Isabelle Weindl;Alessio Mastrucci;Fabio Carrer;Jarmo Kikstra;Geanderson Ambrósio;Ana Paula Dutra Aguiar;Lavinia Baumstark;Benjamin Leon Bodirsky;Astrid Bos;Jan Philipp Dietrich;Alois Dirnaichner;Jonathan C Doelman;Robin Hasse;Ariel Hernandez;Johanna Hoppe;Florian Humpenöder;Gabriela Ileana Iacobuţă;Dorothee Keppler;Johannes Koch;Gunnar Luderer;Hermann Lotze-Campen;Michaja Pehl;Miguel Poblete-Cazenave;Alexander Popp;Merle Remy;Willem-Jan van Zeist;Sarah Cornell;Ines Dombrowsky;Edgar G Hertwich;Falk Schmidt;Bas van Ruijven;Detlef van Vuuren;Elmar Kriegler,Multiple pathways towards sustainable development goals and climate targets,"The UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris climate target require a holistic transformation towards human well-being within planetary boundaries. However, there are growing debates on how to best pursue these targets. Proposed transformation strategies include market- and technology-driven green-growth, shifting towards a sufficiency-oriented post-growth economy, and a transformation driven primarily by strong government action. Here we quantify three alternative sustainable development pathways (SDPs), Economy-driven Innovation, Resilient Communities, and Managing the Global Commons, that reflect these different societal strategies. We compare the quantifications from two integrated assessment models and two sectoral models of the buildings and materials sectors across a broad set of indicators for sustainable development and climate action. Our global multi-scenario and multi-model analysis shows that all three SDPs enable substantial progress towards the human development goals of the SDGs. They simultaneously limit global warming and prevent further environmental degradation, with the sufficiency-oriented Resilient Communities scenario showing the lowest peak warming and lowest reliance on carbon dioxide removal as well as the largest improvements in biodiversity intactness. The SDPs also alleviate the concerns about the biogeophysical and technological feasibility of narrowly-focused climate change mitigation scenarios. However, the shifts in energy and food consumption patterns assumed in the SDPs, ranging from moderate in Economy-driven Innovation to very ambitious in Resilient Communities, also lead to increased challenges regarding socio-cultural feasibility."
10.5194/acp-24-12143-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了赫尔辛基市中心街道峡谷和城市背景站点2015年2月至2019年6月期间气溶胶粒子的数量大小分布。它使用了一种新颖的方法，即正矩阵分解（PMF）分析，结合来自两个站点的颗粒物数据，识别出五个不同的气溶胶源，包括新鲜交通排放（TRA1）、轻度老化交通排放（TRA2）、二次燃烧气溶胶（SCA）、二次气溶胶（SecA）和长距离传输气溶胶（LRT）。研究发现，与交通相关的排放仍然是城市环境中重要的气溶胶来源，即使在排放控制技术改进后也是如此。该研究强调了利用颗粒物数量大小分布数据进行PMF分析来识别气溶胶源的有效性，为城市空气质量监测和改善提供了重要的科学依据。,"['air quality monitoring', 'particle number size distribution', 'aerosol source apportionment', 'traffic emissions', 'urban air pollution', 'PMF analysis']",Sami D.

Measurements were made in Helsinki at a street canyon and urban background sites between February 2015 and June 2019. Five different aerosol sources were identified. These sources underline the significance of traffic-related emissions in urban environments despite recent improvements in emission reduction technologies. 
 Particle size is one of the key factors influencing how aerosol particles affect their climate and health effects. Therefore, a better understanding of particle size distributions from various sources is crucial. In urban environments, aerosols are produced in a large number of varying processes and conditions. This study intended to develop the source apportionment of urban aerosols by utilising a novel approach to positive matrix factorisation (PMF). The particle source profiles were detected in particle number size distribution data measured simultaneously in a street canyon and at a nearby urban background station between February 2015 and June 2019 in Helsinki, southern Finland. The novelty of the method is combining the data from both sites and finding profiles for the unified data. Five aerosol sources were found. Four of them were detected at both of the stations: slightly aged traffic (TRA2), secondary combustion aerosol (SCA), secondary aerosol (SecA), and long-range-transported aerosol (LRT). One of the sources, fresh traffic (TRA1) was only detected at a street canyon. The factors were identified based on available auxiliary data. Additionally, the trends of the found factors were studied, and statistically significant decreasing trends were found for TRA1 and SecA. A statistically significant increasing trend was found for TRA2. This work implies that traffic-related aerosols remain important in urban environments and that aerosol sources can be detected using only particle number size distribution data as input in the PMF method."

Rieger;Mattia Righi;Robin N. Thor,The contribution of transport emissions to ozone mixing ratios and methane lifetime in 2015 and 2050 in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs),"We quantified the contributions of land transport, shipping, and aviation emissions to tropospheric ozone; its radiative forcing; and the reductions of the methane lifetime using chemistry-climate model simulations. The contributions were analysed for the conditions of 2015 and for three projections for the year 2050. The results highlight the challenges of mitigating ozone formed by emissions of the transport sector, caused by the non-linearitiy of the ozone chemistry and the long lifetime. 
 We quantify the contributions of emissions from the transport sector to tropospheric ozone and the hydroxyl radical (OH)  by means of model simulations with a global chemistry-climate model equipped with a source attribution method.  For the first time we applied a method which also allows for quantifying contributions to OH which is invariant upon disaggregation or recombination and additive. Based on these quantified contributions, we analyse the ozone radiative forcing (RF) and methane lifetime reductions attributable to emissions from the transport sectors. The contributions were analysed for each transport sector separately and for 2015 as well as for 2050 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0. In line with previous publications using the source attribution approach, we quantify ozone RF attributable to emissions from land transport, shipping, and aviation for the year 2015 of 121, 60, and 31 mW m−2, respectively.  At the same time, we diagnose a relative reduction in methane lifetime due to transport emissions of 14.3 % (land transport), 8.5 % (shipping), and 3.8 % (aviation). These reductions are significantly larger than reported by previous studies due to the application of the source attribution method. Compared to 2015, only SSP1-1.9 shows a strong decrease in ozone RF and methane lifetime reduction attributable to the entire transport sector in 2050. For the projections of SSP2-4.5, we find similar effects of the total transport sector as for 2015, while the effects in SSP3-7.0 increase compared to 2015. This small change in the effects for the two projections compared to 2015 is caused by two main factors. Firstly, aviation emissions are projected to increase in SSP2-4.5  (increase of 107 %) and SSP3-7.0 (+86 %) compared to 2015, resulting in projected ozone RF of 55 mW m−2 (+78 %) and 50 mW m−2 (+61 %)  for the year 2050 from aviation emissions. Secondly, the non-linear effects of atmospheric chemistry in polluted regions such as Europe and North America lead to rather small reductions in ozone and OH in response to emission reductions, especially from land transport emissions. In addition, the increase in emissions from land transport in other parts of the world, particularly in South Asia, leads to an increased contribution of ozone and OH. In particular, ozone formed by land transport emissions from South Asia causes strong RF that partially offsets the reductions in Europe and North America. Moreover, our results show that besides the non-linear response, lack of international cooperation, as in the SSP3-7.0 projection, hinders mitigation of ground-level ozone."
10.5194/acp-24-12161-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了撒哈拉沙漠粗颗粒矿物尘在大气中的长距离传输。研究者利用飞机观测数据评估了英国气象局统一模型对粗颗粒尘埃传输的模拟能力。结果表明，该模型低估了所有传输阶段的粗颗粒尘埃数量，并且快速去除大颗粒会随着距离撒哈拉沙漠距离的增加而加剧这种低估。研究发现，模型总体上复制了总尘埃质量的垂直分布，但将较大的尘埃颗粒传输到大气中较低的高度。重要的是，模型中的粗颗粒沉降速度过快，导致尘埃质量低估，并且随着向西传输而加剧；在2到3.7公里高度之间，20-63微米尘埃质量的贡献被低估了，在撒哈拉沙漠低估了11倍，在加那利群岛低估了140倍，在佛得角低估了240倍。在加勒比地区，与观测到的10%相比，模型中d>20微米颗粒对总质量的贡献可以忽略不计。这项工作进一步证明了需要对气候模型尘埃模拟进行基于过程的评估，以确定改进之处。 这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到大气成分分析（矿物尘埃）、利用飞机观测数据进行的遥感测量以及气候模型的评估。,"['mineral dust', 'aerosol', 'climate model', 'atmospheric composition', 'long-range transport', 'aircraft observation', 'particle size distribution']",Natalie G.

We use aircraft measurements to assess a climate model representation of large-dust transport. We find that the model underestimates the amount of large dust at all stages of transport and that fast removal of the large particles increases this underestimation with distance from the Sahara. 
 Coarse mineral dust particles have been observed much further from the Sahara than expected based on theory. They have impacts different to finer particles on Earth's radiative budget, as well as carbon and hydrological cycles, though they tend to be under-represented in climate models. We use measurements of the full dust size distribution from aircraft campaigns over the Sahara, Canaries, Cabo Verde and Caribbean. We assess the observed and modelled dust size distribution over long-range transport at high vertical resolution using the Met Office Unified Model, which represents dust up to 63.2 µm diameter, greater than most climate models. We show that the model generally replicates the vertical distribution of the total dust mass but transports larger dust particles too low in the atmosphere. Importantly, coarse particles in the model are deposited too quickly, resulting in an underestimation of dust mass that is exacerbated with westwards transport; the 20–63 µm dust mass contribution between 2 and 3.7 km altitude is underestimated by factors of up to 11 in the Sahara, 140 in the Canaries and 240 in Cabo Verde. In the Caribbean, there is negligible modelled contribution of d > 20 µm particles to total mass, compared to 10 % in the observations. This work adds to the growing body of research that demonstrates the need for a process-based evaluation of climate model dust simulations to identify where improvements could be implemented."
10.5194/acp-24-12107-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了北极海冰中的裂隙（leads）释放的海盐气溶胶对高北极地区大气气溶胶的影响。研究利用Nilsson等人的观测数据，结合数值模型和卫星数据，建立了第一个描述海冰裂隙释放海盐气溶胶的参数化模型。结果表明，裂隙释放的海盐气溶胶的年排放量占北极海冰区域海盐气溶胶总排放量的0.3%到9.8%（数量），30%到85%（质量）。研究还利用区域大气化学模型WRF-Chem模拟了裂隙释放气溶胶的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星数据来获取海冰信息，并通过对气溶胶排放的建模来分析其对大气成分和空气质量的影响。,"['Sea spray aerosol', 'Sea ice', 'Arctic climate', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Aerosol number emissions', 'Atmospheric chemistry model', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Sea salt aerosol']",Rémy Lapere;Louis Marelle;Pierre Rampal;Laurent Brodeau;Christian Melsheimer;Gunnar Spreen;Jennie L. Thomas,Modeling the contribution of leads to sea spray aerosol in the high Arctic,"Elongated open-water areas in sea ice, called leads, can release marine aerosols into the atmosphere. In the Arctic, this source of atmospheric particles could play an important role for climate. However, the amount, seasonality and spatial distribution of such emissions are all mostly unknown. Here, we propose a first parameterization for sea spray aerosols emitted through leads in sea ice and quantify their impact on aerosol populations in the high Arctic. 
 Elongated open-water areas in sea ice (leads) release sea spray particles to the atmosphere. However, there is limited knowledge on the amount, properties and drivers of sea spray emitted from leads, and no existing parameterization of this process is available for use in models. In this work, we use measurements of aerosol fluxes from Nilsson et al. (2001) to produce an estimate of the location, timing and amount of sea spray emissions from leads at the scale of the Arctic Ocean for 1 year. Lead fractions are derived using sea ice data sets from numerical models and satellite detection. The proposed parameterization estimates that leads account for 0.3 %–9.8 % of the annual sea salt aerosol number emissions in the Arctic Ocean regions where sea ice concentration is greater than 80 %. Assuming similar size distributions to those from emissions from the open ocean, leads account for 30 %–85 % of mass emissions in sea ice regions. The total annual mass of sea salt emitted from leads, 0.1–2.1 Tg yr−1, is comparable to the mass of sea salt aerosol transported above sea ice from the open ocean, according to the MERRA-2 reanalysis. In addition to providing the first estimates of possible upper and lower bounds of sea spray emissions from leads, the conceptual model developed in this work is implemented and tested in the regional atmospheric chemistry model WRF-Chem. Given the estimates obtained in this work, the impact of sea spray from leads on Arctic clouds and radiative budget needs to be further explored."

Our investigations show the observed diurnal evolution of NO2 at different measurement sites. 
 Instruments for air quality observations on geostationary satellites provide multiple observations per day and allow for the analysis of the diurnal variation in important air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The South Korean instrument GEMS (Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer), launched in February 2020, is the first geostationary instrument that is able to observe the diurnal variation in NO2. The measurements have a spatial resolution of 3.5 km × 8 km and cover a large part of Asia.This study compares 1 year of tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) observations from the operational GEMS L2 product, the scientific GEMS IUP-UB (Institute of Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen) product, the operational TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) product, and ground-based differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) measurements in South Korea. The GEMS L2 tropospheric NO2 VCDs overestimate the ground-based tropospheric NO2 VCDs with a median relative difference of +61 % and a correlation coefficient of 0.76. The median relative difference is −2 % for the GEMS IUP-UB product and −16 % for the TROPOMI product, with correlation coefficients of 0.83 and 0.89, respectively. The scatter in the GEMS products can be reduced when observations are limited to the TROPOMI overpass time.Diurnal variations in tropospheric NO2 VCDs differ by the pollution level of the analyzed site but with good agreement between the GEMS IUP-UB and ground-based observations. Low-pollution sites show weak or almost no diurnal variation. In summer, the polluted sites show a minimum around noon, indicating the large influence of photochemical loss. Most variation is seen in spring and autumn, with increasing NO2 in the morning, a maximum close to noon, and a decrease towards the afternoon. Winter observations show rather flat or slightly decreasing NO2 throughout the day. Winter observations under low-wind-speed conditions at high-pollution sites show enhancements of NO2 throughout the day. This indicates that under calm conditions, dilution and the less effective chemical loss in winter do not balance the accumulating emissions. Diurnal variation observed at a low-pollution site follows seasonal wind patterns.A weekday–weekend effect analysis shows good agreement between the different products. However, the GEMS L2 product, while agreeing with the other data sets on weekdays, shows significantly less reduction on weekends.The influence of the stratospheric contribution and the surface reflectivity product on the satellite tropospheric NO2 VCD products is investigated. While the TM5 model's stratospheric VCDs, used in the TROPOMI product, are too high, resulting in tropospheric NO2 VCDs that are too low and even negative, when used in the GEMS IUP-UB retrieval, the GEMS L2 stratospheric VCD is too low. Surface reflectivity comparisons indicate that the GEMS L2 reflectivity makes a large contribution to the observed overestimation and scatter."

The methodology exploits synergies between spectrometers and imagers, like TROPOMI and VIIRS. The largest improvements have been identified for heterogeneous scenes at cloud edges. This approach is generic and can also be applied to future Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 instruments. 
 The retrieval of cloud parameters from the atmospheric Sentinel missions requires Earth reflectance measurements from a set of spectral bands. The ground pixels of the involved spectral bands should be fully aligned, but when they are not, special treatment is required within the operational algorithms. This so-called inter-band spatial misregistration of passive spectrometers is present when the Earth reflectance measurements in different spectral bands are captured by different spectrometers. The cloud retrieval algorithm requires reflectance measurements in the UV(ultraviolet)–VIS (visible) band, where the first cloud parameter (i.e., radiometric cloud fraction) is retrieved from OCRA (Optical Cloud Recognition Algorithm). In addition, Earth reflectances in the NIR (near-infrared) band are needed for the retrieval of two additional cloud parameters (i.e., cloud height and cloud albedo or cloud-top height and optical thickness) from the ROCINN (Retrieval of Cloud Information using Neural Networks) algorithm. In the former TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument)/S5P (Sentinel-5 Precursor) retrieval, a coregistration scheme of the derived cloud parameters from the source band to the target band based on pre-calculated mapping weights from UV–VIS to NIR and vice versa is applied. In this paper we present a new scheme for the coregistration of the TROPOMI cloud parameters using collocated VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite)/SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) information. The new coregistration scheme based on the VIIRS data improves the TROPOMI cloud product quality and allows the addition of cloud information for the first (westernmost) TROPOMI UVIS ground pixel. In practice, the latter means that a significant number of valid data points are included in the TROPOMI cloud, total ozone, SO2 and HCHO product since 26 November 2023 (orbit 31705), when the new coregistration scheme became operational. From a comparison analysis between the two techniques, we found that the largest differences mainly appear for inhomogeneous scenes. From a validation exercise of TROPOMI against VIIRS in the across-track direction, we found that the old coregistration scheme tends to smooth out cloud structures along the scan line, whereas such structures can be maintained with the new scheme. The need to implement a similar inter-band spatial coregistration scheme is foreseen for the Sentinel-4/MTG-S (Meteosat Third Generation – Sounder) and Sentinel-5/MetOp-SG (Meteorological Operational Satellite – Second Generation) missions. In the case of the Sentinel-4 instrument, the external cloud information will originate from collocated data captured by the FCI (Flexible Combined Imager) on board the MTG-I (Meteosat Third Generation – Imager) satellite."

 Geolocation and co-registration methodologies are essential for the accurate interpretation of observations from spaceborne remote sensors. In preparations for the Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE), here, we refine the definition of these techniques and present various examples of geolocation assessments. The geolocation methods build upon earlier work; however, they introduce several improvements that have increased the reliability of the geolocation accuracy. The EarthCARE active-sensor geolocation methods use coastlines and significant elevation gradients in both statistical and numerical ways. The effectiveness of the proposed geolocation methods was tested using the extensive record of CloudSat and CALIPSO observations.

In this paper we collect and make a synthesis of a body of these observations since 1972 in order to provide researchers modeling Earth's climate and developing satellite observations from space with a simple way of confronting their results and understanding their validity. 
 Mineral dust aerosol is important in the Earth system, and the correct representation of its size distribution is fundamental for shaping the current state and evolution of the climate. Despite many observational dust size data that are available in the literature, using this body of information to properly guide the development and validation of climate models and remote sensing retrievals remains challenging. In this study we collect, evaluate, harmonize, and synthesize 58 size distribution data from the past 50 years of in situ field observations with the aim of providing a consistent dataset to the community for use in constraining the representation of dust size across its life cycle. Four levels (LEVs) of data treatment are defined, going from original data (LEV0), data interpolated and normalized on a standardized diameter grid (LEV1), and data in which original particle diameters are converted to a common geometrical definition under both spherical (LEV2a) and aspherical (LEV2b) assumptions. Size distributions are classified as emission or source (SOURCE, <1 d from emission; number of datasets in this category N=12), mid-range transport (MRT, 1–4 d of transport; N=36), and long-range transport (LRT, >4 d of transport; N=10). The harmonized dataset shows consistent features suggesting the conservation of airborne particles with time and a decrease in the main coarse-mode diameter from a value on the order of 10 µm (in volume) for SOURCE dust to a value on the order of 1–2 µm for LRT conditions. An additional mode becomes evident below 0.4 µm for MRT and LRT dust. Data for the three levels (LEV1, LEV2a, and LEV2b) and the three categories (SOURCE, MRT, and LRT), together with statistical metrics (mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and standard deviation), are available as follows:

Since 2016, a continuous ground hydrothermal regime and soil nutrient content observation system has been gradually established in Northeast China. The integrated dataset includes soil moisture content, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, ground temperatures at depths of 0–20 m, and active layer thickness from 2016 to 2022. 
 Under a warming climate, the occurrence of wildfires has been becoming increasingly more frequent in boreal forests and Arctic tundra over the last few decades. Wildfires can cause radical changes in forest ecosystems and the permafrost environment, such as the irreversible degradation of permafrost, succession of boreal forests, rapid and massive losses of soil carbon stock, and increased periglacial geohazards. Since 2016, we have gradually and more systematically established a network for studying soil nutrients and monitoring the hydrothermal state of the active layer and near-surface permafrost in the northern Da Xing'anling Mountains in Northeast China. Soil moisture content (depth of 0–9.4 m), soil organic carbon content (0–3.6 m), total nitrogen content (0–3.6 m), and total phosphorus and potassium content (0–3.6 m) datasets were obtained in 2016 via field sampling and subsequent laboratory tests. Ground temperature (0–20 m) and active layer thickness (2017–2022) datasets were obtained using thermistor cables that were permanently installed in boreholes or interpolated with these temperatures. The present data can be used to simulate changes in permafrost features under a changing climate and wildfire disturbances and to explore the changing interactive mechanisms of the fire–permafrost–carbon system in hemiboreal forests. Furthermore, they can provide baseline data for studies and action plans to support the carbon neutralization initiative and assessment of the ecological safety and management of the permafrost environment.

To understand the EAC regime and the inner shelf dynamics, we implement the variational approach to produce the first multi-year coastal radar dataset (2012–2023) in this region. The validated data allows for a comprehensive investigation of the EAC dynamics. This dataset will be useful for understanding the complex EAC regime and its far-reaching impacts on the shelf environment. 
 The East Australian Current (EAC) exhibits significant variability across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, from mesoscale eddies and meanders to seasonal, interannual, and decadal fluctuations in its intensity, pathway, and influence on the continental shelf circulation. Understanding and monitoring this variability is crucial because the EAC plays an important role in controlling shelf dynamics, regional circulation, coastal weather and global climate patterns. As such, two high-frequency (HF) coastal radar systems have been deployed on the east coast of Australia to measure surface currents upstream and downstream of the East Australian Current (EAC) separation point. The multi-year radar dataset (spanning 4–8 years) is presented here and its use is demonstrated to assess the spatial and temporal variability of the EAC and the adjacent continental shelf circulation, ranging from seasonal to interannual scales. The dataset is gap-filled using a 2dVar approach (after rigorous comparison with the traditional unweighted Least-squares fit (LS) method). Additionally, we explore the representation depth variability of the observations by comparing the data with surface Lagrangian drifter velocities (with and without depth drogues). The multi-year radar-derived surface current dataset, which was validated using short-term drifter and long-term current meter observations, revealed that the local upstream circulation is strongly dominated by the EAC’s annual cycle, peaking in the austral summer. The analysis using 8 years of upstream data revealed the period of the EAC intensification at around 3–5 years. The interannual variability of the poleward transport downstream was driven by the intrinsic variability of the jet. This dataset which continues to be collected, complemented by numerical simulations and in-situ measurements, will provide a comprehensive view of the EAC’s variability and its impact on the broader regional circulation dynamics which can be used for a range of dynamical investigations."

The new aerosol and precipitation acidity diagnostics showed good agreement against observational datasets. 
 The atmospheric composition forecasting system used to produce the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) forecasts of global aerosol and trace gas distributions, the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS-COMPO), undergoes periodic upgrades. In this study we describe the development of the future operational cycle 49R1 and focus on the implementation of the thermodynamical model EQSAM4Clim version 12, which represents gas–aerosol partitioning processes for the nitric acid–nitrate and  ammonia–ammonium couples and computes diagnostic aerosol, cloud, and precipitation pH values at the global scale. This information on aerosol acidity influences the simulated tropospheric chemistry processes associated with aqueous-phase chemistry and wet deposition. The other updates of cycle 49R1 concern wet deposition, sea-salt aerosol emissions, dust optics, and size distribution used for the calculation of sulfate aerosol optics. The implementation of EQSAM4Clim significantly improves the partitioning of reactive nitrogen compounds, decreasing surface concentrations of both nitrate and ammonium in the particulate phase, which reduces PM2.5 biases for Europe, the US, and China, especially during summertime. For aerosol optical depth there is generally a decrease in the simulated wintertime biases and for some regions an increase in the summertime bias. Improvements in the simulated Ångström exponent are noted for almost all regions, resulting in generally good agreement with observations. The diagnostic aerosol and precipitation pH calculated by EQSAM4Clim have been compared to ground observations and published simulation results. For precipitation pH, the annual mean values show  relatively good agreement with the regional observational datasets, while for aerosol pH the simulated values over continents are quite close to those simulated by ISORROPIA II. The use of aerosol acidity has a relatively smaller impact on the aqueous-phase production of sulfate compared to the changes in gas-to-particle partitioning induced by the use of EQSAM4Clim."

Our proposed model can significantly assist avalanche forecasters in their decision-making process, thereby facilitating more efficient and accurate predictions crucial for ensuring safety in Switzerland's avalanche-prone regions. 
 Despite the increasing use of physical snow cover simulations in regional avalanche forecasting, avalanche forecasting is still an expert-based decision-making process. However, recently, it has become possible to obtain fully automated avalanche danger level predictions with satisfying accuracy by combining physically based snow cover models with machine learning approaches. These predictions are made at the location of automated weather stations close to avalanche starting zones. To bridge the gap between these local predictions and fully data- and model-driven regional avalanche danger maps, we developed and evaluated a three-stage model pipeline (RAvaFcast v1.0.0), involving the steps classification, interpolation, and aggregation. More specifically, we evaluated the impact of various terrain features on the performance of a Gaussian-process-based model for interpolation of local predictions to unobserved locations on a dense grid. Aggregating these predictions using an elevation-based strategy, we estimated the regional danger level and the corresponding elevation range for predefined warning regions, resulting in a forecast similar to the human-made public avalanche forecast in Switzerland. The best-performing model matched the human-made forecasts with a mean day accuracy of approximately 66 % for the entire forecast domain and 70 % specifically for the Alps. However, the performance depended strongly on the classifier's accuracy (i.e., a mean day accuracy of 68 %) and the density of local predictions available for the interpolation task. Despite these limitations, we believe that the proposed three-stage model pipeline has the potential to improve the interpretability of machine-made danger level predictions and has, thus, the potential to assist avalanche forecasters during forecast preparation, for instance, by being integrated in the forecast process in the form of an independent virtual forecaster."

 Numerical methods and simulation codes are essential for the advancement of our understanding of complex atmospheric processes. As technology and computer hardware continue to evolve, the development of sophisticated code is vital for accurate and efficient simulations. In this paper, we present the recent advancements made in the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART), a Lagrangian particle dispersion model, which has been used in a wide range of atmospheric transport studies over the past 3 decades, extending from tracing radionuclides from the Fukushima nuclear disaster, to inverse modelling of greenhouse gases, and to the study of atmospheric moisture cycles.This version of FLEXPART includes notable improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency. (1) By leveraging the native vertical coordinates of European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) instead of interpolating to terrain-following coordinates, we achieved an improvement in trajectory accuracy, leading to a ∼8 %–10 % reduction in conservation errors for quasi-conservative quantities like potential vorticity. (2) The shape of aerosol particles is now accounted for in the gravitational settling and dry-deposition calculation, increasing the simulation accuracy for non-spherical aerosol particles such as microplastic fibres. (3) Wet deposition has been improved by the introduction of a new below-cloud scheme, by a new cloud identification scheme, and by improving the interpolation of precipitation. (4) Functionality from a separate version of FLEXPART, the FLEXPART CTM (chemical transport model), is implemented, which includes linear chemical reactions. Additionally, the incorporation of Open Multi-Processing parallelisation makes the model better suited for handling large input data. Furthermore, we introduced novel methods for the input and output of particle properties and distributions. Users now have the option to run FLEXPART with more flexible particle input data, providing greater adaptability for specific research scenarios (e.g. effective backward simulations corresponding to satellite retrievals).

Current climate models often simplify this process because they don't have detailed enough information about the land surface. Our study developed a new model that divides the land surface into hillslopes to better represent how groundwater flows. This model can help improve predictions of water availability and how it affects ecosystems. 
 Lateral groundwater flow (LGF) is an important hydrologic process in controlling water table dynamics. Due to the relatively coarse spatial resolutions of land surface models, the representation of this process is often overlooked or overly simplified. In this study, we developed a hillslope-based lateral groundwater flow model. Specifically, we first developed a hillslope definition model based on an existing watershed delineation model to represent the subgrid spatial variability in topography. Building upon this hillslope definition, we then developed a physical-based lateral groundwater flow using Darcy’s equation. This model explicitly considers the relationships between the groundwater table along the hillslope and the river water table levels. We coupled this intra-grid model to the land component (ELM) and river component (MOSART) of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). We tested both the hillslope definition model and the lateral groundwater flow model and performed sensitivity experiments using different configurations. Simulations for a single grid cell at 0.5° × 0.5° within the Amazon basin show that the definition of hillslope is the key to modeling lateral flow processes and the runoff partition between surface and subsurface can be dramatically changed using the hillslope approach. Although our method provides a pathway to improve the lateral flow process, future improvements are needed to better capture the subgrid structure to account for the spatial variability in hillslopes within the simulated grid of land surface models."

Novel PFASs were extensively detected in 98.4% of the samples, with 21 species being first reported, which greatly facilitated the appointment of diverse emission sources that aligned with local industrial structures. However, legacy PFASs still dominated the ∑74PFAS profile (median 0.51 ng/g, 0.050–8.33 ng/g).

The formation of Nb–O–Ce bonds was observed to enhance the surface acidic sites, thereby improving HCl selectivity and reducing the production of chlorinated byproducts. Meanwhile, it inhibits the formation of Ru–O–Ce and promotes the generation of highly dispersed RuO2 particles on the surface, enhancing the redox properties and mobility of the surface oxygen, thus increasing CO2 selectivity. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy results revealed that chlorine species preferentially attach to Nb species rather than to oxygen vacancies on the Ru/Nb/CeO2 catalyst. This allows more alkane groups to oxidize to formate on the oxygen vacancies, reducing byproduct concentration.

While microcystin and its biosynthesis pathway, encoded by the mcy genes, have been well studied for over 50 years, a recent study found that Microcystis populations in western Lake Erie contain a transcriptionally active partial mcy operon, in which the A2 domain of mcyA and mcyB-C are present but the mcyD-J genes are absent. Here, we investigate the potential biosynthetic products and the evolutionary history of this partial operon. Our results reveal two candidate tetrapeptide constructs, with an X variable position, to be produced by strains with the partial operon. The partial operon appears necessary and sufficient for tetrapeptide biosynthesis and likely evolved from a single ancestor hundreds to tens of thousands of years ago. Bioactivity screens using Hep3B cells indicate a mild elevation of some markers of hepatotoxicity and inflammation, suggesting the need to further assess the effects of these novel secondary metabolites on freshwater ecosystems and public health. The need to assess these effects is even more pressing given the detection of tetrapeptides in both culture and western Lake Erie, which is a vital source of fresh water. Results from this study emphasize previous findings in which novel bacterial secondary metabolites may be derived from the molecular evolution of existing biosynthetic machinery under different environmental forcings."

Even when present at low concentrations, impurities can alter the solubility and reactivity of the host mineral. In this study, we investigate the incorporation of trace amounts of iron (Fe3+) and chromium (Cr3+) during the crystal growth of the aluminum (Al3+) hydroxide, gibbsite, a major component of bauxite ores, an important soil mineral, and a dominant mineral phase in stored radioactive wastes. Using a comprehensive suite of analytical techniques, we show that both Cr3+ and Fe3+ can be incorporated into the gibbsite lattice during coprecipitation by replacing Al3+ in octahedral sites. These small amounts are consistent with limited to no structural isomorphism shared between Al3+ and Cr3+/Fe3+ hydroxide precipitates, nor room temperature miscibility of their isostructural M2O3 oxide forms, in contrast with oxyhydroxide forms where Al3+ and Fe3+ share similar structural topologies. Despite the limited uptake of Cr3+/Fe3+, we show that these impurities have significant implications for gibbsite dissolution behavior. The limited uptake of Cr3+/Fe3+ (e.g. 0.43% Cr3+ and 0.4% Fe3+), we show that these impurities have significant implications for gibbsite dissolution behavior and subsequent reactivity in complex environments."

Composting will likely be the primary alternative to landfilling, and 75–100 new large-scale composting facilities must be sited in the state to meet its diversion goal. We developed a strategy for evaluating site suitability for commercial composting by incorporating land-use, economic, and environmental justice criteria. In our Baseline scenario, we identified 899 candidate sites, and nearly all are within a cost-effective hauling distance of cropland and rangelands for compost application. About half of  sites, mostly in rural areas, are not within a cost-effective collection distance of enough municipal organics to supply an average-sized facility. Conversely, sites near cities have greater access to organics but cause greater health damages from ammonia and volatile organic compounds emitted during the composting process. The additional required composting capacity corresponds to $266–355 million in annual damages from air pollution. However, this excludes avoided emissions from landfilling, and damages could be reduced by 56% if aerated static piles are used instead of windrows. Siting a higher number of smaller decentralized facilities could also help equally distribute air pollution to avoid concentrating burdens in certain communities."

Yet, rapid detection of LMMPs (1–10 μm) at the single-particle level within complex freshwater matrices remains a hurdle. We developed an adaptable plasmonic membrane sensor for fast detection of individual LMMPs in eutrophic lake waters. The plasmonic membrane sensor functions both as a membrane filter and as a sensor for LMMP collection and analysis. Among the four types of membrane sensors, polycarbonate track-etch (PCTE) membrane sensors exhibit superior imaging quality for LMMPs due to their flat and homogeneous surfaces. Besides the significantly improved imaging contrast and reduced background interferences, the Raman intensity of LMMPs is enhanced by 48% ± 25% on PCTE membrane sensors compared to unmodified membranes. The increased Raman intensities of a chemical probe with an increasing gold layer thickness and a decreasing membrane pore size suggest a surface-enhanced Raman scattering effect from the membrane sensors. The membrane sensors achieve a detection limit of 1 μg/L and an ultrafast scanning time of 0.01 s for individual LMMPs across natural eutrophic lake water.

While well-studied in bulk water, indirect photolysis processes at environmental interfaces remain largely unexplored. This study reveals a significant acceleration of indirect photodegradation of organic pollutants at the soil–water interface of wetlands. Organic pollutants experienced ubiquitously enhanced indirect photodegradation at the soil–water interfaces, with rates 1.41 ± 0.01 to 4.27 ± 0.03-fold higher than those in bulk water. This enhancement was observed across various natural and artificial wetlands, including coastal wetlands and rice paddies. In situ mapping indicated that soil–water interfaces act as hotspots, concentrating both organic pollutants and PPRIs by 9.30- and 4.27-folds, respectively. This synchronized colocation is the primary cause of the accelerated pollutant photolysis. Additionally, the contribution of each PPRI species to pollutant photolysis and a coupled transformation pathway at the soil–water interface significantly differed from those in bulk water. For instance, the contribution of singlet oxygen to metoxuron photolysis increased from 10.1% in bulk water to 44.4% at the soil–water interface.

While fire suppressing products used on wildfires must be approved by the U.S. Forest Service, portions of their formulations are trade secrets. Increased metals content in soils and surface waters at the wildland-urban interface has been observed after wildfires but has primarily been attributed to ash deposition or anthropogenic impact from nearby urban areas. In this study, metal concentrations in several fire suppression products (some approved by the U.S. Forest Service, and some marketed for consumer use) were quantified to evaluate whether these products could contribute to increased metal concentrations observed in the environment postfire. Long-term fire retardants contained concentrations of toxic metals (V, Cr, Mn, Cu, As, Cd, Sb, Ba, Tl, and Pb) 4–2,880 times greater than drinking water regulatory limits, and potentially greater than some aquatic toxicity thresholds when released into the environment. Water enhancers and Class A foams contained some metals, but at lower concentrations than fire retardants.

Results indicated higher OPv and TI levels during haze periods, with trimodal variations: the highest OPv peak in the 7.2–10 μm and the highest TI peak in the 0–0.49 μm. For the first time, multilayer perception analysis was applied to predict both OPv and ecotoxicity, offering enhanced accuracy by capturing synergistic and antagonistic interactions among various chemical components. Lung deposition doses of size-resolved PM inducing OPv and TI within the human respiratory system were estimated. Findings revealed that the largest particles (7.2–10 μm) predominantly affected the head airways, whereas particles in the 1.5–3.0 μm significantly impacted the pulmonary region. This behavior is attributed to quinones and high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HMW-PAHs), which have higher deposition efficiency in the head airways and elevated concentrations in the pulmonary region, respectively. To mitigate health risks associated with these toxicants, efforts should target their size-dependent properties and lung deposition efficiency, considering various health end points.

These ROC serve as critical precursors to ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Therefore, it is essential to estimate ROC emissions from VCPs in China accurately. In this study, the VCPy framework developed by the U.S. EPA was used to simulate ROC evaporative emissions from VCPs in mainland China, and its emission inventory was established. The results indicate that in 2019, the total ROC emissions from VCP sources in mainland China amounted to 9.4 Tg (6.9 TgC) with a 95% confidence interval of 8.4–11.8 Tg (6.2–8.7 TgC). The category of paints and coatings emerged as the dominant contributor to ROC emissions, emitting 6.0 Tg (4.4 TgC), accounting for 63.7% of total ROC emissions, followed by the category of cleaning products at 11.2% and the category of adhesives at 10.1%. Among ROC emissions, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) accounted for the largest proportion, followed by intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), accounting for 23.6%. Oxygenated organic compounds and aromatics were the dominant components emitted from VCPs, accounting for 48.0% and 31.0% of ROC emission mass, respectively. Moreover, the mass proportion of oxygenated organic compounds in IVOC emissions was 72.0%. However, oxygenated organic compounds and aromatics were still predominantly emitted in the form of VOCs. Additionally, the O3 formation potential (OFP) and SOA formation potential (SOAFP) of the ROC emissions from VCPs were estimated at 32.0 and 0.5 Tg, respectively, suggesting the significant impact of ROC emissions on O3 and SOA from VCP sources. Emissions of oxygenated organic compounds contributed significantly to OFP and SOAFP by 33.8% and 17.1%, respectively. By comparing with measurement data, the VCPy framework can reliably reproduce the emissions of key species from VCPs in mainland China.

To begin understanding its potential toxicity, solvent extracts of the nurdles and pyroplastic were screened for their bioactivity by several Attagene FACTORIAL bioassays (TF, NR, and AquaTox), which measured the activity of a combined 70 human transcription factor response elements and nuclear receptors and 6 to 7 nuclear receptors for each of three phylogenetically distinct fish species. Extracts of the pyroplastics robustly activated end points for the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), estrogen receptor (ER), pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), and oxidative stress (NRF2) and had the potential for activation of several others.

To reconcile this disparity, numerical experiments are conducted to explore the response of FACs under large IEF. Results show that FACs may exhibit either linear or saturated responses, depending on the Alfvén Mach number. The magnetospheric closure paths of region 1 currents differ significantly between the linear and saturated conditions. In the linear case, essential parts of the region 1 current extend toward dayside and connect to the magnetopause currents, whereas these parts of currents almost disappear in the saturation state. Saturation usually occurs under sub‐Alfvénic solar wind conditions, so the observed FACs generally grow linearly with IEF."

However, the irrigation effect on increasing humidity has often been missed, especially in humid regions, leaving its effect and mechanism on extreme humid heat (EHH) poorly characterized. We analyzed assemblies of observations and performed regional simulations with more detailed irrigation scheme to explore the irrigation impacts and potential mechanisms on EHH. We find that irrigation in EC, despite having a cooling effect of about 0.2–0.6° ${}^{\circ}$C, leads to an increase of about 0.4–0.8° ${}^{\circ}$C in EHH, with a more intense impact on the Middle‐Lower Yangtze Plain (MLYP) by 0.9° ${}^{\circ}$C. Cooling effect induced by increased latent heat fluxes through irrigation contributes to air deposition, which lowers boundary layer height, raises near‐surface moist enthalpy, and ultimately exacerbates the EHH.

The movement history of boulders is crucial for the reconstruction of paleo‐tsunamis. We report findings from viscous remanent magnetization studies of the boulders on Tongatapu Island, aiming to reconstruct their reworkings. Two boulders exhibited viscous remanence, whereas two larger boulders lacked viscous components but exhibited stable remanence. Both the viscous and stable components deviated from the geomagnetic field direction. These observations indicate that: (a) the boulders with a viscous component were reworked before the latest event, which could have reworked all boulders, and (b) the magnitude of the latest event was larger than that of an earlier event. The reworked timing indicated that the event occurred between 3,000 years ago and the fifteenth century. The difference in the wave height required to move boulders on the eastern and western coasts suggests that the source of the earlier tsunami was likely an eruption due to volcanoes along the Tonga Ridge."

We use 3‐D thermal evolution models to investigate the effects of lateral variations of surface temperature and crustal thickness on the surface and core‐mantle boundary (CMB) heat fluxes, and elastic thickness distribution. Surface temperature variations cause a long‐wavelength perturbation of the heat fluxes, as well as of the elastic lithosphere thickness, while variations in crustal thickness affect these quantities at small spatial scales.

We explore how discrete representation of preferential flow‐paths provides innovative ways to invert electrical resistivity data collected during reagent injection at a contaminated site. The data set is inverted with a scheme where a new fracture is added at every iteration. This allows identifying newly created narrow conductive structures from the field data collected before and after injection. Fracture location remains overall consistent despite using different starting points for the fracture search. A prior constraint on fracture length improves convergence.

Tracking the locations of the high strains throughout loading suggests that the deformation that occurs early in loading influences the location of the system‐sized fracture network that produces macroscopic failure.

 Lytic cell death culminates in plasma membrane rupture (PMR), which releases large intracellular molecules to augment the inflammatory response. PMR is mediated by the effector membrane protein ninjurin-1 (NINJ1)1, which polymerises and ruptures the membrane via its hydrophilic face1–4. How NINJ1 is restrained under steady-state conditions to ensure cell survival remains a mystery. Here we describe the molecular underpinnings of NINJ1 inhibition. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we determined the structure of inactive-state mouse NINJ1 bound to a newly-developed nanobody, Nb538. Inactive NINJ1 forms a face-to-face homodimer by adopting a 3-helix conformation with unkinked transmembrane helix 1 (TM1), in contrast to the 4-helix TM1-kinked active conformation2–4. Accordingly, endogenous NINJ1 from primary macrophages is a dimer under steady-state conditions. Inactive dimers sequester the PMR-inducing hydrophilic face of NINJ1 and occlude the binding site for kinked TM1 from neighbouring activated NINJ1 molecules. Mutagenesis studies in cells show that destabilisation of inactive face-to-face dimers leads to NINJ1-mediated cell death, whereas stabilisation of face-to-face dimers inhibits NINJ1 activity. Moreover, destabilising mutations prompt spontaneous TM1 kink formation, a hallmark of NINJ1 activation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that dimeric NINJ1 is autoinhibited in trans to prevent unprovoked PMR and cell death."

 Approximately 3.4 million patients worldwide are diagnosed each year with cancers that harbor pathogenic mutations in one of three RAS proto-oncogenes (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS)1,2. These mutations impair the GTPase activity of RAS, leading to activation of downstream signaling and proliferation3-6. Long-standing efforts to restore the hydrolase activity of RAS mutants have been unsuccessful, extinguishing any consideration towards a viable therapeutic strategy7. Here we show that tri-complex inhibitors, that is, molecular glues with the ability to recruit cyclophilin A (CYPA) to the active state of RAS have a dual mechanism of action: not only do they prevent activated RAS from binding to its effectors, but, unexpectedly, they also stimulate GTP hydrolysis. Drug-bound CYPA complexes modulate residues in the switch II motif of RAS to coordinate the nucleophilic attack on the ɣ phosphate of GTP, in a mutation-specific manner. RAS mutants most sensitive to stimulation of GTPase activity were more susceptible to treatment compared to mutants whose hydrolysis could not be enhanced, suggesting that pharmacologic stimulation of hydrolysis potentiates the therapeutic effects of tri-complex inhibitors for specific RAS mutants. This study lays the foundation for developing a new class of therapeutics that inhibit cancer growth by stimulating mutant GTPase activity."

 The central nervous system (CNS), despite the presence of strategically positioned anatomical barriers designed to protect it, is not entirely isolated from the immune system1,2. In fact, it remains physically connected to and can be influenced by the peripheral immune system1. How the CNS retains such responsiveness while maintaining an immunologically unique status remains an outstanding conundrum. In searching for molecular cues that derive from the CNS and allow its direct communication with the immune system, we discovered an endogenous repertoire of CNS-derived regulatory self-peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecules at the CNS borders. During homeostasis, these regulatory self-peptides were found to be bound to MHC II molecules throughout the path of lymphatic drainage from the brain to its surrounding meninges and its draining cervical lymph nodes. With neuroinflammatory disease, however, the presentation of regulatory self-peptides diminished. Upon boosting the presentation of these regulatory self-peptides, a population of suppressor CD4+ T cells was expanded, controlling CNS autoimmunity in a CTLA-4 and TGFβ dependent manner. This unexpected discovery of CNS-derived autoimmune self-peptides may be the molecular key adapting the CNS to maintain continuous dialogue with the immune system while balancing overt autoreactivity. This sheds new light on how we conceptually think about and therapeutically target neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases."

 Unravelling the origin and evolution of precancerous lesions is crucial for effectively preventing malignant transformation, yet our current knowledge remains limited1–3. Here we used a base editor-enabled DNA barcoding system4 to comprehensively map single-cell phylogenies in mouse models of intestinal tumorigenesis induced by inflammation or loss of the Apc gene. Through quantitative analysis of high-resolution phylogenies including 260,922 single cells from normal, inflamed and neoplastic intestinal tissues, we identified tens of independent cell lineages undergoing parallel clonal expansions within each lesion. We also found polyclonal origins of human sporadic colorectal polyps through bulk whole-exome sequencing and single-gland whole-genome sequencing. Genomic and clinical data support a model of polyclonal-to-monoclonal transition, with monoclonal lesions representing a more advanced stage. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed extensive intercellular interactions in early polyclonal lesions, but there was significant loss of interactions during monoclonal transition. Therefore, our data suggest that colorectal precancer is often founded by many different lineages and highlight their cooperative interactions in the earliest stages of cancer formation.

 The quantum-mechanical nuclear-shell structure determines the stability and limits of the existence of the heaviest nuclides with large proton numbers Z ≳ 100 (refs. 1–3). Shell effects also affect the sizes and shapes of atomic nuclei, as shown by laser spectroscopy studies in lighter nuclides4. However, experimental information on the charge radii and the nuclear moments of the heavy actinide elements, which link the heaviest naturally abundant nuclides with artificially produced superheavy elements, is sparse5. Here we present laser spectroscopy measurements along the fermium (Z = 100) isotopic chain and an extension of data in the nobelium isotopic chain (Z = 102) across a key region. Multiple production schemes and different advanced techniques were applied to determine the isotope shifts in atomic transitions, from which changes in the nuclear mean-square charge radii were extracted. A range of nuclear models based on energy density functionals reproduce well the observed smooth evolution of the nuclear size. Both the remarkable consistency of model prediction and the similarity of predictions for different isotopes suggest a transition to a regime in which shell effects have a diminished effect on the size compared with lighter nuclei.

 Loss-of-function mutations in the tumour suppressor APC are an initial step in intestinal tumorigenesis1,2. APC-mutant intestinal stem cells outcompete their wild-type neighbours through the secretion of Wnt antagonists, which accelerates the fixation and subsequent rapid clonal expansion of mutants3–5. Reports of polyclonal intestinal tumours in human patients and mouse models appear at odds with this process6,7. Here we combine multicolour lineage tracing with chemical mutagenesis in mice to show that a large proportion of intestinal tumours have a multiancestral origin. Polyclonal tumours retain a structure comprising subclones with distinct Apc mutations and transcriptional states, driven predominantly by differences in KRAS and MYC signalling. These pathway-level changes are accompanied by profound differences in cancer stem cell phenotypes. Of note, these findings are confirmed by introducing an oncogenic Kras mutation that results in predominantly monoclonal tumour formation. Further, polyclonal tumours have accelerated growth dynamics, suggesting a link between polyclonality and tumour progression. Together, these findings demonstrate the role of interclonal interactions in promoting tumorigenesis through non-cell autonomous pathways that are dependent on the differential activation of oncogenic pathways between clones.

Here we introduce a strategy to engineer functional customized viral receptors (CVRs). The modular design relies on building artificial receptor scaffolds comprising various modules and generating specific virus-binding domains. We identify key factors for CVRs to functionally mimic native receptors by facilitating spike proteolytic cleavage, membrane fusion, pseudovirus entry and propagation for various coronaviruses. We delineate functional SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding sites for CVR design and reveal the mechanism of cell entry promoted by the N-terminal domain-targeting S2L20-CVR. We generated CVR-expressing cells for 12 representative coronaviruses from 6 subgenera, most of which lack known receptors, and show that a pan-sarbecovirus CVR supports propagation of a propagation-competent HKU3 pseudovirus and of authentic RsHuB2019A3. Using an HKU5-specific CVR, we successfully rescued wild-type and ZsGreen-HiBiT-incorporated HKU5-1 (LMH03f) and isolated a HKU5 strain from bat samples. Our study demonstrates the potential of the CVR strategy for establishing native receptor-independent infection models, providing a tool for studying viruses that lack known susceptible target cells. A strategy using engineered functional customized viral receptors enables the development of functional infection models for coronaviruses whose native cellular receptors are unknown."

 Sleep is integral to cardiovascular health1,2. Yet, the circuits that connect cardiovascular pathology and sleep are incompletely understood. It remains unclear whether cardiac injury influences sleep and whether sleep-mediated neural outputs contribute to heart healing and inflammation. Here we report that in humans and mice, monocytes are actively recruited to the brain after myocardial infarction (MI) to augment sleep, which suppresses sympathetic outflow to the heart, limiting inflammation and promoting healing. After MI, microglia rapidly recruit circulating monocytes to the brain’s thalamic lateral posterior nucleus (LPN) via the choroid plexus, where they are reprogrammed to generate tumour necrosis factor (TNF). In the thalamic LPN, monocytic TNF engages Tnfrsf1a-expressing glutamatergic neurons to increase slow wave sleep pressure and abundance. Disrupting sleep after MI worsens cardiac function, decreases heart rate variability and causes spontaneous ventricular tachycardia. After MI, disrupting or curtailing sleep by manipulating glutamatergic TNF signalling in the thalamic LPN increases cardiac sympathetic input which signals through the β2-adrenergic receptor of macrophages to promote a chemotactic signature that increases monocyte influx. Poor sleep in the weeks following acute coronary syndrome increases susceptibility to secondary cardiovascular events and reduces the heart’s functional recovery. In parallel, insufficient sleep in humans reprogrammes β2-adrenergic receptor-expressing monocytes towards a chemotactic phenotype, enhancing their migratory capacity. Collectively, our data uncover cardiogenic regulation of sleep after heart injury, which restricts cardiac sympathetic input, limiting inflammation and damage. Studies in humans and mice show that myocardial infarction recruits monocytes to the brain’s thalamus, promoting sleep, which in turn restricts cardiac inflammation and sympathetic signalling and assists healing."

 Additive manufacturing is an expanding multidisciplinary field encompassing applications including medical devices1, aerospace components2, microfabrication strategies3,4 and artificial organs5. Among additive manufacturing approaches, light-based printing technologies, including two-photon polymerization6, projection micro stereolithography7,8 and volumetric printing9–14, have garnered significant attention due to their speed, resolution or potential applications for biofabrication. Here we introduce dynamic interface printing, a new 3D printing approach that leverages an acoustically modulated, constrained air–liquid boundary to rapidly generate centimetre-scale 3D structures within tens of seconds. Unlike volumetric approaches, this process eliminates the need for intricate feedback systems, specialized chemistry or complex optics while maintaining rapid printing speeds. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique across a broad array of materials and intricate geometries, including those that would be impossible to print with conventional layer-by-layer methods. In doing so, we demonstrate the rapid fabrication of complex structures in situ, overprinting, structural parallelization and biofabrication utility. Moreover, we show that the formation of surface waves at the air–liquid boundary enables enhanced mass transport, improves material flexibility and permits 3D particle patterning. We, therefore, anticipate that this approach will be invaluable for applications where high-resolution, scalable throughput and biocompatible printing is required.

 Now extinct, the aurochs (Bos primigenius) was a keystone species in prehistoric Eurasian and North African ecosystems, and the progenitor of cattle (Bos taurus), domesticates that have provided people with food and labour for millennia1. Here we analysed 38 ancient genomes and found 4 distinct population ancestries in the aurochs—European, Southwest Asian, North Asian and South Asian—each of which has dynamic trajectories that have responded to changes in climate and human influence. Similarly to Homo heidelbergensis, aurochsen first entered Europe around 650 thousand years ago2, but early populations left only trace ancestry, with both North Asian and European B. primigenius genomes coalescing during the most recent glaciation. North Asian and European populations then appear separated until mixing after the climate amelioration of the early Holocene. European aurochsen endured the more severe bottleneck during the Last Glacial Maximum, retreating to southern refugia before recolonizing from Iberia. Domestication involved the capture of a small number of individuals from the Southwest Asian aurochs population, followed by early and pervasive male-mediated admixture involving each ancestral strain of aurochs after domestic stocks dispersed beyond their cradle of origin. An analysis of 38 ancient genomes from the aurochs, the extinct ancestor of modern cattle, provides insight into the population ancestry and domestication of this species."

 The Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is at present the largest single contributor to global-mass-induced sea-level rise, primarily because of Arctic amplification on an increasingly warmer Earth1–5. However, the processes of englacial water accumulation, storage and ultimate release remain poorly constrained. Here we show that a noticeable amount of the summertime meltwater mass is temporally buffered along the entire GrIS periphery, peaking in July and gradually reducing thereafter. Our results arise from quantifying the spatiotemporal behaviour of the total mass of water leaving the GrIS by analysing bedrock elastic deformation measured by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations. The buffered meltwater causes a subsidence of the bedrock close to GNSS stations of at most approximately 5 mm during the melt season. Regionally, the duration of meltwater storage ranges from 4.5 weeks in the southeast to 9 weeks elsewhere. We also show that the meltwater runoff modelled from regional climate models may contain systematic errors, requiring further scaling of up to about 20% for the warmest years. These results reveal a high potential for GNSS data to constrain poorly known hydrological processes in Greenland, forming the basis for improved projections of future GrIS melt behaviour and the associated sea-level rise6.

 The circadian rhythm of the immune system helps to protect against pathogens1–3; however, the role of circadian rhythms in immune homeostasis is less well understood. Innate T cells are tissue-resident lymphocytes with key roles in tissue homeostasis4–7. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing, a molecular-clock reporter and genetic manipulations to show that innate IL-17-producing T cells—including γδ T cells, invariant natural killer T cells and mucosal-associated invariant T cells—are enriched for molecular-clock genes compared with their IFNγ-producing counterparts. We reveal that IL-17-producing γδ (γδ17) T cells, in particular, rely on the molecular clock to maintain adipose tissue homeostasis, and exhibit a robust circadian rhythm for RORγt and IL-17A across adipose depots, which peaks at night. In mice, loss of the molecular clock in the CD45 compartment (Bmal1∆Vav1) affects the production of IL-17 by adipose γδ17 T cells, but not cytokine production by αβ or IFNγ-producing γδ (γδIFNγ) T cells. Circadian IL-17 is essential for de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue, and mice with an adipocyte-specific deficiency in IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) have defects in de novo lipogenesis. Whole-body metabolic analysis in vivo shows that Il17a−/−Il17f−/− mice (which lack expression of IL-17A and IL-17F) have defects in their circadian rhythm for de novo lipogenesis, which results in disruptions to their whole-body metabolic rhythm and core-body-temperature rhythm. This study identifies a crucial role for IL-17 in whole-body metabolic homeostasis and shows that de novo lipogenesis is a major target of IL-17.

 As cancers progress, they become increasingly aggressive—metastatic tumours are less responsive to first-line therapies than primary tumours, they acquire resistance to successive therapies and eventually cause death1,2. Mutations are largely conserved between primary and metastatic tumours from the same patients, suggesting that non-genetic phenotypic plasticity has a major role in cancer progression and therapy resistance3–5. However, we lack an understanding of metastatic cell states and the mechanisms by which they transition. Here, in a cohort of biospecimen trios from same-patient normal colon, primary and metastatic colorectal cancer, we show that, although primary tumours largely adopt LGR5+ intestinal stem-like states, metastases display progressive plasticity. Cancer cells lose intestinal cell identities and reprogram into a highly conserved fetal progenitor state before undergoing non-canonical differentiation into divergent squamous and neuroendocrine-like states, a process that is exacerbated in metastasis and by chemotherapy and is associated with poor patient survival. Using matched patient-derived organoids, we demonstrate that metastatic cells exhibit greater cell-autonomous multilineage differentiation potential in response to microenvironment cues compared with their intestinal lineage-restricted primary tumour counterparts. We identify PROX1 as a repressor of non-intestinal lineage in the fetal progenitor state, and show that downregulation of PROX1 licenses non-canonical reprogramming.

 Leptin is an adipose tissue hormone that maintains homeostatic control of adipose tissue mass by regulating the activity of specific neural populations controlling appetite and metabolism1. Leptin regulates food intake by inhibiting orexigenic agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons and activating anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons2. However, whereas AGRP neurons regulate food intake on a rapid time scale, acute activation of POMC neurons has only a minimal effect3–5. This has raised the possibility that there is a heretofore unidentified leptin-regulated neural population that rapidly suppresses appetite. Here we report the discovery of a new population of leptin-target neurons expressing basonuclin 2 (Bnc2) in the arcuate nucleus that acutely suppress appetite by directly inhibiting AGRP neurons. Opposite to the effect of AGRP activation, BNC2 neuronal activation elicited a place preference indicative of positive valence in hungry but not fed mice. The activity of BNC2 neurons is modulated by leptin, sensory food cues and nutritional status. Finally, deleting leptin receptors in BNC2 neurons caused marked hyperphagia and obesity, similar to that observed in a leptin receptor knockout in AGRP neurons. These data indicate that BNC2-expressing neurons are a key component of the neural circuit that maintains energy balance, thus filling an important gap in our understanding of the regulation of food intake and leptin action. We find that leptin-target neurons expressing basonuclin 2 in the arcuate nucleus that acutely suppress appetite by directly inhibiting agouti-related protein neurons are a key component of the neural circuit that maintains energy balance."

 Temporal ordering of cellular events offers fundamental insights into biological phenomena. Although this is traditionally achieved through continuous direct observations1,2, an alternative solution leverages irreversible genetic changes, such as naturally occurring mutations, to create indelible marks that enables retrospective temporal ordering3–5.

Using this approach, we uncovered precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during mouse embryonic development, unconventional developmental relationships between cell types and new epithelial progenitor states by their unique genetic histories. Analysis of mouse adenomas, coupled to multiomic and single-cell profiling of human precancers, with clonal analysis of 418 human polyps, demonstrated the occurrence of polyclonal initiation in 15–30% of colonic precancers, showing their origins from multiple normal founders.

 Softening of the transverse optical (TO) phonon, which could trigger ferroelectric phase transition, can usually be achieved by enhancing the long-range Coulomb interaction over the short-range bonding force1, for example, by increasing the Born effective charges2. However, it suffers from depolarization effects3,4 as the induced ferroelectricity is suppressed on size reduction of the host materials towards high-density nanoscale electronics. Here, we present an alternative route to drive the TO phonon softening by showing that the abnormal soft TO phonon in rocksalt-structured ultrawide-bandgap BeO (ref. 5) is mainly induced by a substantial reduction in the short-range bonding interaction due to the Be–O bond stretching caused by an electron cloud-overlap-induced Coulomb repulsion between two adjacent oxygen ions that are arranged octahedrally around an extremely small Be ion. We further demonstrate the emergence of robust ferroelectricity in strain-induced perovskite BaZrO3 and ultrathin HfO2 and ZrO2 films6,7 grown epitaxially on lattice-mismatched SiO2/Si substrate arising from the softening of the TO phonon driven by a reduction in the short-range bonding strength of biaxial strain-induced stretching bonds. These findings shed light on developing a unified theory for ferroelectricity enhancement in ultrathin films free from depolarization fields by tailoring chemical bonds using ionic radius differences, strains, doping and lattice distortions.

 To study the spatial interactions among cancer and non-cancer cells1, we here examined a cohort of 131 tumour sections from 78 cases across 6 cancer types by Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST). This was combined with 48 matched single-nucleus RNA sequencing samples and 22 matched co-detection by indexing (CODEX) samples. To describe tumour structures and habitats, we defined ‘tumour microregions’ as spatially distinct cancer cell clusters separated by stromal components. They varied in size and density among cancer types, with the largest microregions observed in metastatic samples. We further grouped microregions with shared genetic alterations into ‘spatial subclones’. Thirty five tumour sections exhibited subclonal structures. Spatial subclones with distinct copy number variations and mutations displayed differential oncogenic activities. We identified increased metabolic activity at the centre and increased antigen presentation along the leading edges of microregions. We also observed variable T cell infiltrations within microregions and macrophages predominantly residing at tumour boundaries. We reconstructed 3D tumour structures by co-registering 48 serial ST sections from 16 samples, which provided insights into the spatial organization and heterogeneity of tumours. Additionally, using an unsupervised deep-learning algorithm and integrating ST and CODEX data, we identified both immune hot and cold neighbourhoods and enhanced immune exhaustion markers surrounding the 3D subclones. These findings contribute to the understanding of spatial tumour evolution through interactions with the local microenvironment in 2D and 3D space, providing valuable insights into tumour biology.

 Prokaryotic anti-phage immune systems use TIR and cGAS-like enzymes to produce 1′′-3′-glycocyclic ADP-ribose (1′′-3′-gcADPR) and cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) and cyclic trinucleotide (CTN) signalling molecules, respectively, which limit phage replication1–3. However, how phages neutralize these distinct and common systems is largely unclear. Here we show that the Thoeris anti-defence proteins Tad14 and Tad25 both achieve anti-cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling system (anti-CBASS) activity by simultaneously sequestering CBASS cyclic oligonucleotides. Apart from binding to the Thoeris signals 1′′-3′-gcADPR and 1′′-2′-gcADPR, Tad1 also binds to numerous CBASS CDNs and CTNs with high affinity, inhibiting CBASS systems that use these molecules in vivo and in vitro. The hexameric Tad1 has six binding sites for CDNs or gcADPR, which are independent of the two high-affinity binding sites for CTNs. Tad2 forms a tetramer that also sequesters various CDNs in addition to gcADPR molecules, using distinct binding sites to simultaneously bind to these signals. Thus, Tad1 and Tad2 are both two-pronged inhibitors that, alongside anti-CBASS protein 2 (Acb26–8), establish a paradigm of phage proteins that use distinct binding sites to flexibly sequester a considerable breadth of cyclic nucleotides. Phage Thoeris anti-defence proteins Tad1 and Tad2 both achieve anti-CBASS activity by simultaneously sequestering CBASS cyclic oligonucleotides."

 The remarkable increase in superconducting transition temperature (Tc) observed at the interface of one-unit-cell FeSe films on SrTiO3 substrates (1 uc FeSe/STO)1 has attracted considerable research into the interface effects2–6. Although this high Tc is thought to be associated with electron–phonon coupling (EPC)2, the microscopic coupling mechanism and its role in the superconductivity remain elusive. Here we use momentum-selective high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy to atomically resolve the phonons at the FeSe/STO interface. We uncover new optical phonon modes, coupling strongly with electrons, in the energy range of 75–99 meV. These modes are characterized by out-of-plane vibrations of oxygen atoms in the interfacial double-TiOx layer and the apical oxygens in STO. Our results also demonstrate that the EPC strength and superconducting gap of 1 uc FeSe/STO are closely related to the interlayer spacing between FeSe and the TiOx terminated STO. These findings shed light on the microscopic origin of the interfacial EPC and provide insights into achieving large and consistent Tc enhancement in FeSe/STO and potentially other superconducting systems.

 Extensive forest restoration is a key strategy to meet nature-based sustainable development goals and provide multiple social and environmental benefits1. Yet achieving forest restoration at scale requires cost-effective methods2. Tree planting in degraded landscapes is a popular but costly forest restoration method that often results in less biodiverse forests when compared to natural regeneration techniques under similar conditions3. Here we assess the current spatial distribution of pantropical natural forest (from 2000 to 2016) and use this to present a model of the potential for natural regeneration across tropical forested countries and biomes at a spatial resolution of 30 m. We estimate that an area of 215 million hectares—an area greater than the entire country of Mexico—has potential for natural forest regeneration, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration potential of 23.4 Gt C (range, 21.1–25.7 Gt) over 30 years. Five countries (Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Colombia) account for 52% of this estimated potential, showcasing the need for targeting restoration initiatives that leverage natural regeneration potential. Our results facilitate broader equitable decision-making processes that capitalize on the widespread opportunity for natural regeneration to help achieve national and global environmental agendas.

 The Caucasus and surrounding areas, with their rich metal resources, became a crucible of the Bronze Age1 and the birthplace of the earliest steppe pastoralist societies2. Yet, despite this region having a large influence on the subsequent development of Europe and Asia, questions remain regarding its hunter-gatherer past and its formation of expansionist mobile steppe societies3–5. Here we present new genome-wide data for 131 individuals from 38 archaeological sites spanning 6,000 years. We find a strong genetic differentiation between populations north and south of the Caucasus mountains during the Mesolithic, with Eastern hunter-gatherer ancestry4,6 in the north, and a distinct Caucasus hunter-gatherer ancestry7 with increasing East Anatolian farmer admixture in the south. During the subsequent Eneolithic period, we observe the formation of the characteristic West Eurasian steppe ancestry and heightened interaction between the mountain and steppe regions, facilitated by technological developments of the Maykop cultural complex8. By contrast, the peak of pastoralist activities and territorial expansions during the Early and Middle Bronze Age is characterized by long-term genetic stability. The Late Bronze Age marks another period of gene flow from multiple distinct sources that coincides with a decline of steppe cultures, followed by a transformation and absorption of the steppe ancestry into highland populations.

 Cancer driver mutations often show distinct temporal acquisition patterns, but the biological basis for this, if any, remains unknown. RAS mutations occur invariably late in the course of acute myeloid leukaemia, upon progression or relapsed/refractory disease1–6. Here, by using human leukaemogenesis models, we first show that RAS mutations are obligatory late events that need to succeed earlier cooperating mutations. We provide the mechanistic explanation for this in a requirement for mutant RAS to specifically transform committed progenitors of the myelomonocytic lineage (granulocyte–monocyte progenitors) harbouring previously acquired driver mutations, showing that advanced leukaemic clones can originate from a different cell type in the haematopoietic hierarchy than ancestral clones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RAS-mutant leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) give rise to monocytic disease, as observed frequently in patients with poor responses to treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. We show that this is because RAS-mutant LSCs, in contrast to RAS-wild-type LSCs, have altered BCL2 family gene expression and are resistant to venetoclax, driving clinical resistance and relapse with monocytic features. Our findings demonstrate that a specific genetic driver shapes the non-genetic cellular hierarchy of acute myeloid leukaemia by imposing a specific LSC target cell restriction and critically affects therapeutic outcomes in patients.

 Moiré materials have enabled the realization of flat electron bands and quantum phases that are driven by the strong correlations associated with flat bands1–4. Superconductivity has been observed, but only in graphene moiré materials5–9. The absence of robust superconductivity in moiré materials beyond graphene, such as semiconductor moiré materials4, has remained a mystery and challenged our current understanding of superconductivity in flat bands. Here we report the observation of robust superconductivity in both 3.5° and 3.65° twisted bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2), which hosts a hexagonal moiré lattice10,11. Superconductivity emerges near half-band filling and zero external displacement fields. The optimal superconducting transition temperature is about 200 mK in both cases and constitutes about 1–2% of the effective Fermi temperature; the latter is comparable to the value in high-temperature cuprate superconductors12 and suggests strong pairing. The superconductor borders on two distinct metals below and above half-band filling; it undergoes a continuous transition to a correlated insulator by tuning the external displacement field.

 The dosage of X-linked genes is accurately regulated with the development of fetal germ cells (FGCs)1,2. How aberrant dosage of X-linked genes impairs FGC development in humans remains poorly understood. FGCs of patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS), who have an extra X chromosome, provide natural models for addressing this issue3. Here we demonstrate that most human FGCs in KS are arrested at an early stage, characterized by the upregulation of genes related to pluripotency, the WNT pathway and the TGF-β pathway, along with the downregulation of genes involved in FGC differentiation. The limited KS FGCs that are capable of reaching the late stage remain relatively naive. X chromosomes are not inactivated and the dosage of X-linked genes is excessive in KS FGCs. X-linked genes dominate the differentially expressed genes and are enriched in critical biological processes associated with the developmental delay of KS FGCs. Moreover, aberrant interactions between Sertoli cells and FGCs disrupt the migration of late FGCs to the basement membrane in KS. Notably, inhibition of the TGF-β pathway improves the differentiation of KS FGCs. Our findings elucidate how the extra X chromosome impairs the development of male FGCs and reveal the initial molecular events preceding germ cell loss in KS.

 The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei evades clearance by the host immune system through antigenic variation of its dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat, periodically ‘switching’ expression of the VSG using a large genomic repertoire of VSG-encoding genes1–6. Recent studies of antigenic variation in vivo have focused near exclusively on parasites in the bloodstream6–8, but research has shown that many, if not most, parasites reside in the interstitial spaces of tissues9–13. We sought to explore the dynamics of antigenic variation in extravascular parasite populations using VSG-seq7, a high-throughput sequencing approach for profiling VSGs expressed in populations of T. brucei. Here we show that tissues, not the blood, are the primary reservoir of antigenic diversity during both needle- and tsetse bite-initiated T. brucei infections, with more than 75% of VSGs found exclusively within extravascular spaces. We found that this increased diversity is correlated with slower parasite clearance in tissue spaces. Together, these data support a model in which the slower immune response in extravascular spaces provides more time to generate the antigenic diversity needed to maintain a chronic infection. Our findings reveal the important role that extravascular spaces can have in pathogen diversification.

 Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) replaces the stem cells responsible for blood production with those from a donor1,2. Here, to quantify dynamics of long-term stem cell engraftment, we sequenced genomes from 2,824 single-cell-derived haematopoietic colonies of ten donor–recipient pairs taken 9–31 years after HLA-matched sibling HCT3. With younger donors (18–47 years at transplant), 5,000–30,000 stem cells had engrafted and were still contributing to haematopoiesis at the time of sampling; estimates were tenfold lower with older donors (50–66 years). Engrafted cells made multilineage contributions to myeloid, B lymphoid and T lymphoid populations, although individual clones often showed biases towards one or other mature cell type. Recipients had lower clonal diversity than matched donors, equivalent to around 10–15 years of additional ageing, arising from up to 25-fold greater expansion of stem cell clones. A transplant-related population bottleneck could not explain these differences; instead, phylogenetic trees evinced two distinct modes of HCT-specific selection. In pruning selection, cell divisions underpinning recipient-enriched clonal expansions had occurred in the donor, preceding transplant—their selective advantage derived from preferential mobilization, collection, survival ex vivo or initial homing. In growth selection, cell divisions underpinning clonal expansion occurred in the recipient’s marrow after engraftment, most pronounced in clones with multiple driver mutations. Uprooting stem cells from their native environment and transplanting them to foreign soil exaggerates selective pressures, distorting and accelerating the loss of clonal diversity compared to the unperturbed haematopoiesis of donors.

 How the olfactory system detects and distinguishes odorants with diverse physicochemical properties and molecular configurations remains poorly understood. Vertebrate animals perceive odours through G protein-coupled odorant receptors (ORs)1. In humans, around 400 ORs enable the sense of smell. The OR family comprises two main classes: class I ORs are tuned to carboxylic acids whereas class II ORs, which represent most of the human repertoire, respond to a wide variety of odorants2. A fundamental challenge in understanding olfaction is the inability to visualize odorant binding to ORs. Here we uncover molecular properties of odorant–OR interactions by using engineered ORs crafted using a consensus protein design strategy3. Because such consensus ORs (consORs) are derived from the 17 major subfamilies of human ORs, they provide a template for modelling individual native ORs with high sequence and structural homology. The biochemical tractability of consORs enabled the determination of four cryogenic electron microscopy structures of distinct consORs with specific ligand recognition properties. The structure of a class I consOR, consOR51, showed high structural similarity to the native human receptor OR51E2 and generated a homology model of a related member of the human OR51 family with high predictive power. Structures of three class II consORs revealed distinct modes of odorant-binding and activation mechanisms between class I and class II ORs. Thus, the structures of consORs lay the groundwork for understanding molecular recognition of odorants by the OR superfamily. Use of the consensus protein design method facilitated the generation of stable engineered mammalian odorant receptors to gain insight into the molecular properties of odorant–receptor interactions."

 Anurans are characterized by a biphasic life cycle, with an aquatic larval (tadpole) stage followed by an adult (frog) stage, both connected through the metamorphic period in which drastic morphological and physiological changes occur1. Extant tadpoles exhibit great morphological diversity and ecological relevance2, but their absence in the pre-Cretaceous fossil record (older than 145 million years) makes their origins and early evolution enigmatic. This contrasts with the postmetamorphic anuran fossil record that dates back to the Early Jurassic and with closely related species in the Late Triassic (around 217–213 million years ago (Ma))3. Here we report a late-stage tadpole of the stem-anuran Notobatrachus degiustoi from the Middle Jurassic of Patagonia (around 168–161 Ma). This finding has dual importance because it represents the oldest-known tadpole and, to our knowledge, the first stem-anuran larva. Its exquisite preservation, including soft tissues, shows features associated with the filter-feeding mechanism characteristic of extant tadpoles4,5. Notably, both N. degiustoi tadpole and adult reached a large size, demonstrating that tadpole gigantism occurred among stem-anurans. This new discovery reveals that a biphasic life cycle, with filter-feeding tadpoles inhabiting aquatic ephemeral environments, was already present in the early evolutionary history of stem-anurans and has remained stable for at least 161 million years.

 The Paris Agreement mandates that signatory countries enhance the transparency of their national greenhouse gas inventories. China’s inventories have reported substantial forest carbon gains using ground-based forest plot measurements, but independent satellite-based support for such inventories is lacking and the contributions from human management and anthropogenic environmental changes (atmospheric CO2 growth, climate change and nitrogen deposition) are unknown. Here we use remote sensing and vegetation modelling to investigate the changes in woody biomass carbon and their drivers across China from 2001 to 2020. Our results show a forest cover increase of 6.2% (59.2 Mha) over this period and a woody biomass carbon sink of 208.6 ± 51.8 TgC yr−1, consistent with the national inventories. The conservation of forest and woodland areas made an unexpectedly large contribution (59.2%) to the observed sink, with an additional 29.4% from anthropogenic expansion. Of these management-driven sinks, 53.7% (99.2 TgC yr−1) is attributed to a direct management effect and the remaining 46.3% to the effects of environmental changes. China’s ecological restoration projects contributed 73.5% of the direct management effect.

 Large igneous provinces erupt highly reactive, predominantly basaltic lavas onto Earth’s surface, which should boost the weathering flux leading to long-term CO2 drawdown and cooling following cessation of volcanism. However, throughout Earth’s geological history, the aftermaths of multiple Phanerozoic large igneous provinces are marked by unexpectedly protracted climatic warming and delayed biotic recovery lasting millions of years beyond the most voluminous phases of extrusive volcanism. Here we conduct geodynamic modelling of mantle melting and thermomechanical modelling of magma transport to show that rheologic feedbacks in the crust can throttle eruption rates despite continued melt generation and CO2 supply. Our results demonstrate how the mantle-derived flux of CO2 to the atmosphere during large igneous provinces can decouple from rates of surface volcanism, representing an important flux driving long-term climate. Climate–biogeochemical modelling spanning intervals with temporally calibrated palaeoclimate data further shows how accounting for this non-eruptive cryptic CO2 can help reconcile the life cycle of large igneous provinces with climate disruption and recovery during the Permian–Triassic, Mid-Miocene and other critical moments in Earth’s climate history. These findings underscore the key role that outgassing from intrusive magmas plays in modulating our planet’s surface environment.

 The majority of anticancer agents have a reduced or even complete loss of a therapeutic effect within hypoxic tumors. To overcome this limitation, research efforts have been devoted to the development of therapeutic agents with biological mechanisms of action that are independent of the oxygen concentration. Here we show the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of the incorporation of a ruthenium (Ru) catalyst into polymeric nanoreactors for hypoxic anticancer therapy. The nanoreactors can catalyze the oxidation of glutathione (GSH) to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in hypoxic cancer cells. This initiates the buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxides, leading to the demise of cancer cells. It also stimulates the overexpression of the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) ion channels, triggering macrophage activation, leading to a systemic immune response. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoreactors can systemically activate the immune system, and nearly fully eradicate an aggressive osteosarcoma tumor inside a mouse model.

 The selective incorporation of a deuterium atom into small molecules with high selectivity is highly valuable for medical and chemical research. Unfortunately, this remains challenging due to the complete deuteration caused by commonly used hydrogen isotope exchange strategies. We report the development of a photocatalytic selective monodeuteration protocol utilizing C–C bond as the unconventional functional handle. The synergistic combination of radical-mediated C–C bond scission and deuterium atom transfer processes enables the effective constructions of benzylic CDH moieties with high selectivity for monodeuteration. The combinational use of a bisphosphonium photocatalyst, thiol catalyst, and CH3OD deuteration agent provides operationally simple conditions for photocatalytic monodeuteration. Moreover, the photoinduced electron transfer process of the bisphosphonium photocatalyst is elucidated through a series of spectroscopy experiments, identifying a peculiar back electron transfer process that can be regulated by subsequent nucleophilic additions.

 The current limitations in utilizing metal-organic frameworks for (photo)electrochemical applications stem from their diminished electrochemical stability. In our study, we illustrate a method to bolster the activity and stability of (photo)electrocatalytically active metal-organic frameworks through ligand engineering. We synthesize four distinct mixed-ligand versions of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67, and conduct a comprehensive investigation into the structural evolution and self-reconstruction during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions. In contrast to the conventional single-ligand ZIF, where the framework undergoes a complete transformation into CoOOH via a stepwise oxidation, the ligand-engineered zeolitic imidazolate frameworks manage to preserve the fundamental framework structure by in-situ forming a protective cobalt (oxy)hydroxide layer on the surface.

Here the authors demonstrate that genetically encoded and engineered α-hemolysin pores can be used to translocate functional peptides across lipid membranes. 
 The development of artificial cells has led to fundamental insights into the functional processes of living cells while simultaneously paving the way for transformative applications in biotechnology and medicine. A common method of generating artificial cells is to encapsulate protein expression systems within lipid vesicles. However, to communicate with the external environment, protein translocation across lipid membranes must take place. In living cells, protein transport across membranes is achieved with the aid of complex translocase systems which are difficult to reconstitute into artificial cells. Thus, there is need for simple mechanisms by which proteins can be encoded and expressed inside synthetic compartments yet still be externally displayed. Here we present a genetically encodable membrane functionalization system based on mutants of pore-forming proteins. We modify the membrane translocating loop of α-hemolysin to translocate functional peptides up to 52 amino acids across lipid membranes. Full membrane translocation occurs in the absence of any translocase machinery and the translocated peptides are recognized by specific peptide-binding ligands on the opposing membrane side. Engineered hemolysins can be used for genetically programming artificial cells to display interacting peptide pairs, enabling their assembly into artificial tissue-like structures. For artificial cells to mimic living cells and communicate with their environment, methods for the translocation of peptides and proteins are needed. Here the authors demonstrate that genetically encoded and engineered α-hemolysin pores can be used to translocate functional peptides across lipid membranes."

 The rapid release of high-performing computer vision models offers new potential to study the impact of different inductive biases on the emergent brain alignment of learned representations. Here, we perform controlled comparisons among a curated set of 224 diverse models to test the impact of specific model properties on visual brain predictivity – a process requiring over 1.8 billion regressions and 50.3 thousand representational similarity analyses. We find that models with qualitatively different architectures (e.g. CNNs versus Transformers) and task objectives (e.g. purely visual contrastive learning versus vision- language alignment) achieve near equivalent brain predictivity, when other factors are held constant. Instead, variation across visual training diets yields the largest, most consistent effect on brain predictivity. Many models achieve similarly high brain predictivity, despite clear variation in their underlying representations – suggesting that standard methods used to link models to brains may be too flexible. Broadly, these findings challenge common assumptions about the factors underlying emergent brain alignment, and outline how we can leverage controlled model comparison to probe the common computational principles underlying biological and artificial visual systems.

In this study, the authors employed operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy to demonstrate that mesoporous carbon supports facilitate optimal ionomer-catalyst interactions, enhancing catalyst performance. 
 To bridge the gap between oxygen reduction electrocatalysts development and their implementation in real proton exchange membrane fuel cell electrodes, an important aspect to be understood is the interaction between the carbon support, the active sites, and the proton conductive ionomer as it greatly affects the local transportations to the catalyst surface. Here we show that three Pt/C catalysts, synthesized using the polyol method with different carbon supports (low surface area Vulcan, high surface area Ketjenblack, and biomass-derived highly ordered mesoporous carbon), revealed significant variations in ionomer-catalyst interactions. The Pt/C catalysts supported on ordered mesoporous carbon derived from biomass showed the best performance under the gas diffusion electrode configuration. Through a unique approach of operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy combined with gas sorption analysis, we were able to demonstrate the beneficial effect of mesopore presence for optimal ionomer-catalyst interaction at both molecular and structural level.

Incorporating fish species movement into fisheries community-based managed areas can catalyse greater conservation and socioeconomic benefits. However, significant gaps exist in aligning small-scale fisheries management with fish connectivity or movement patterns, which can optimize benefits along coral reef systems and associated coastal small-scale fisheries.

 The impacts of Arctic sea ice loss on summertime weather in the Northern Hemisphere have garnered considerable attention. Despite the extensive focus on this relationship, the influence of tropical systems on Arctic regions has been relatively underexplored, with only a limited number of existing studies concentrating exclusively on either dynamic or thermodynamic effects. This study aims to address this gap by examining a barotropic anomalous circulation over the Arctic region associated with Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) rainfall. The observed anomalous circulation exhibits a distinct zonally dipole pattern, characterized by anomalous high pressure over Northern Canada and Asia, coupled with anomalous low pressure located east of Greenland. Verification through model experiments demonstrates that the diabatic heating of ISM rainfall contribute to the formation of the observed ISM-related circulation.

Additionally, from a dynamic standpoint, low-level wind-driven sea ice drift helps shape the spatial distribution and extent of sea ice cover. Besides, the impacts of ISM on Arctic sea ice are largely independent of contemporary ENSO. These findings present fresh perspectives on the role of extrapolar phenomena, such as the ISM, in driving variability in Arctic sea ice during the summer months. This enhanced comprehension holds promise for enhancing predictions of changes in summertime Arctic sea ice extent."

 Our understanding of drought evolution and land-atmosphere interactions under climate mitigation scenarios remains limited. Here, we analyzed future drought under net-zero and net-negative emission scenarios using the Community Earth System Model version 2, particularly focusing on three atmospheric CO2 states: linearly increases, decreases, and a return to the initial state. Interestingly, results revealed that net-zero emissions are more effective for drought mitigation than net-negative targets. Drying trends and drought characteristics — such as the duration, frequency, intensity, and area expansion are prominently increased under net-negative emissions due to higher potential evapotranspiration (PET). This is because the soil moisture and temperature couplings are stronger over drought regions and years, especially under net-negative forcing, with notable impacts in Central Africa and South Asia. Nevertheless, both target scenarios offer regional benefits, such as weakened dryness. This suggests that mitigating CO2 alone may not be sufficient to manage future droughts, highlighting the need for advanced water management strategies."

 Climate change and metals independently stress soil microbiomes, but their combined effects remain unresolved. Here we show that future climate affects soil cadmium through altered soil microbiome and nutrient cycles, with soil pH as critical factor. In soils with pH<7 and during summer temperatures, future climate increased porewater cadmium, shifting total and potentially active taxonomic microbiome structures. Microbial ammonium oxidation released protons liberating cadmium through cation exchange from mineral surfaces. When porewater cadmium levels became toxic to non-cadmium-tolerant bacteria, microbial activity, and nutrient cycling decreased, reducing carbon and nitrogen emissions. In contrast, pH>7 soil show no climate impacts on cadmium mobilization, though imprints on microbiome structure were apparent. Subsequent nutrient cycling increased under future climate, stimulating soil respiration and nitrous oxide release. These findings underscore complex interactions between climate change and soil contaminants affecting the soil microbiome and its activity and highlights potential impacts on crop production, groundwater quality, and climate feedback.

 Atmospheric aerosol radiative effects regulate surface air pollution (O3 and PM2.5) via both the aerosol–photolysis effect (APE) and the aerosol–radiation feedback (ARF) on meteorology. Here, we elucidate the roles of APE and ARF on surface O3 and PM2.5 in the heavily polluted megacity, Delhi, India by using a regional model (WRF-Chem) with constraints from limited surface observations. While APE reduces surface O3 (by 6.1%) and PM2.5 concentrations (by 2.4% via impeding the secondary aerosol formations), ARF contributes to a 2.5% and 17.5% increase in surface O3 and PM2.5, respectively. The ARF from smoke enhances PM2.5 (by 8%), black carbon (by 10%), and primary organic aerosol (by 18%) during late autumn when crop residue burning is significant. The synergistic APE and ARF have a negligible impact on the total concentrations of O3 and PM2.5. Hence, the reduction of PM2.5 may lead to O3 escalation due to weakened APE.

Therefore, this research aimed at quantifying the concentration of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) present in classroom dust and determine associated health risk through different environmental models by employing R-studio. Dust samples from 12 schools situated in rural and urban areas and close to the industrial zones in Khurrianwala, Faisalabad were analyzed on atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results showed that the dust samples contained Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in ranges of 0.02–2.5, 2.5–24.3, 5.4–41.5, 3.6–55.8, and 5.8–146.7 mg kg−1, respectively.

 This study investigates interactions between methylglyoxal (MGL) and 29 different samples, such as clays, proxies and natural dusts from the arid regions of the planet. Initial and quasi steady state uptake coefficients (ɣ0 and ɣqss) of MGL are determined using a Knudsen cell at concentration of 70 ppb, under dry conditions. Remarkably high ɣ0 values for MGL, ranging from 0.05 to 0.67, are determined, close to those of radical species, suggesting a high affinity for dusts. ɣ0 is evidenced to be linearly correlated with the Al/Si ratio of dust samples, indicating a specific initial affinity of MGL with aluminum surface sites. Ɣqss, determined after 40 min of exposure, ranges from 2.9 × 10−7 to 5.9 × 10−6. Ɣqss is linearly correlated with Ti/Si ratio, highlighting specific affinity of MGL with titanium. The impact of concentration on ɣqss is investigated on Gobi dust with MGL concentrations ranging from 0.1 ppt to 2.2 ppm. Ɣqss increases when MGL concentration decreases. Under typical dust storm conditions, MGL uptake competes with gas phase removal by OH radicals or photolysis. In addition, the maximum storage capacity of MGL by samples is determined at 2 ppm with Knudsen cell. MGL uptake does not exceed a compact monolayer on natural dust samples, whereas on some surrogates multilayer uptake is reached. Comparison of ɣ0 and ɣqss of glyoxal and MGL shows that MGL generally exhibits higher affinity with samples. The maximum number of molecules taken up by Gobi dust (Nmax) of MGL is compared with those for isoprene, isopropanol and acetic acid retrieved from literature. It points at the dependance of Nmax on chemical functionality of VOCs: oxygenated compounds exhibit higher interactions with dust. Data are available to increase the representativeness of modeling."

These inputs differ between independent and cooperative breeders: In cooperative breeders, infants interact with multiple caregivers. We study how the neurodevelopmental timing of the cooperatively breeding common marmoset maps onto behavioral milestones. To obtain structure-function co-constructions, we combine behavioral, neuroimaging (anatomical and functional), and neural tracing experiments. We find that brain areas critically involved in observing conspecifics interacting (i) develop in clusters, (ii) have prolonged developmental trajectories, (iii) differentiate during the period of negotiations between immatures and multiple caregivers, and (iv) do not share stronger connectivity than with other regions. Overall, developmental timing of social brain areas correlates with social and behavioral milestones in marmosets and, as in humans, extends into adulthood. This rich social input is likely critical for the emergence of their strong socio-cognitive skills. Because humans are cooperative breeders too, these findings have strong implications for the evolution of human social cognition."

NK cells have impaired cytotoxicity when cultured in hypoxia (1% oxygen) but not physiologic (>5%) or atmospheric oxygen (20%).

Dosing with interleukin-15 (IL-15) enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity in hypoxia, but preactivation with feeder cells bearing IL-21 and 4-1BBL was even better. Preactivation resulted in less perturbed metabolism in hypoxia; greater resistance to oxidative stress; and no hypoxia-induced loss of transcription factors (T-bet and Eomes), activating receptors, adhesion molecules (CD2), and cytotoxic proteins (TRAIL and FasL). There remained a deficit in CD122/IL-2Rβ when exposed to hypoxia, which affected IL-15 signaling.

Here, we used an invasive in vivo mechanistic approach to interrogate muscle insulin action while selectively manipulating the mitochondrial redox state in humans. To this end, we conducted insulin clamp studies combining intravenous infusion of a lipid overload with intake of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (mitoquinone). Under lipid overload, selective modulation of mitochondrial redox state by mitoquinone enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, mitoquinone did not affect canonical insulin signaling but augmented insulin-stimulated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation while reducing the mitochondrial oxidative burden under lipid oversupply. Complementary ex vivo studies in human muscle fibers exposed to high intracellular lipid levels revealed that mitoquinone improves features of mitochondrial bioenergetics, including diminished mitochondrial H2O2emission.

We find that the most stable structure of Bi18−consists of two Bi8cages linked by a Bi2dimer, where each atom is bonded to three neighboring atoms. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that each Bi uses its three 6pelectrons to form three covalent bonds with its neighbors, resulting in a Bi18−cluster without any dangling bonds. We find that the robust Bi18framework along with the totally delocalized unpaired electron is responsible for the surprising inertness of Bi18−toward O2.

The origin of this cognitive ability, constitutive of general intelligence, remains elusive. Here, we show that moderate levels of computation noise in artificial neural networks promote zero-shot generalization for decision-making under uncertainty. Unlike networks featuring noise-free computations, but like human participants tested on similar decision problems (ranging from probabilistic reasoning to reversal learning), noisy networks exhibit behavioral hallmarks of optimal inference in uncertain conditions entirely unseen during training. Computation noise enables this cognitive ability jointly through “structural” regularization of network weights during training and “functional” regularization by shaping the stochastic dynamics of network activity after training. Together, these findings indicate that human cognition may ride on neural variability to support adaptive decisions under uncertainty without extensive experience or engineered sophistication."

Here, we report that caspase-2–driven apoptosis is elicited in blood cells failing cytokinesis and that extra centrosomes are necessary to trigger this cell death. Activation of caspase-2 depends on the PIDDosome multi-protein complex, and priming of PIDD1 at extra centrosomes is necessary for pathway activation. Accordingly, loss of its centrosomal adapter, ANKRD26, allows for cell survival and unrestricted polyploidization in response to cytokinesis failure. Mechanistically, cell death is initiated upstream of mitochondria via caspase-2–mediated processing of the BCL2 family protein BID, driving BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Remarkably, BID-deficient cells enforce apoptosis by engaging p53-dependent proapoptotic transcriptional responses initiated by caspase-2. Consistently, BID and MDM2 act as shared caspase-2 substrates, with BID being kinetically favored. Our findings document that the centrosome limits its own unscheduled duplication by the induction of PIDDosome-driven mitochondrial apoptosis to avoid potentially pathogenic polyploidization events."

By altering communities, such compounds may have unexpected cascading effects on processes ranging from bioturbation to reproduction of species not obviously connected to the producing organisms, warranting greater attention by ecologists."

In this work, we exploit the inherent confocal effect of second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy to acquire highly resolved three-dimensional (3D) images of the chiral nematic phase of CNCs in a label-free manner. An in-depth analysis revealed a direct link between the observed variations in SHG intensity and the pitch. The highly contrasted 3D images provided unprecedented detail into liquid crystal’s native structure. Local alignment, morphology, as well as the presence of defects are readily revealed, and a provisional framework relating the SHG response to the orientational distribution of CNC nanorods within the liquid crystal structure is presented. This paper illustrates the numerous benefits of using SHG microscopy for visualizing CNC chiral nematic systems directly in the suspension-liquid phase and paves the road for using SHG microscopy to characterize other types of aligned CNC structures, in wet and dry states."

Among them, intracellularStaphylococcus aureusrelies on the host cells to protect itself from the attacks by antibiotics or immune system to achieve long-term colonization in the host, and the consequent clinical therapeutic failures and relapses after antibiotic treatment. Here, we demonstrate that intracellularS. aureussurviving well even in the presence of vancomycin can be effectively eliminated using an emerging cell-mimicking therapeutic strategy. These cell mimics with natural killer cell–like activity (NKMs) are composed of a redox-responsive degradable carrier, and perforin and granzyme B within the carrier. NKMs perform far more effectivly than clinical antibiotics in treating intracellular bacterial infections, providing a direct evidence of the NK cell–mimicking immune mechanism in the treatment of intracellularS. aureus."

Hummel,Noninvasive modulation of the hippocampal-entorhinal complex during spatial navigation in humans,"Because of the depth of the hippocampal-entorhinal complex (HC-EC) in the brain, understanding of its role in spatial navigation via neuromodulation was limited in humans. Here, we aimed to better elucidate this relationship in healthy volunteers, using transcranial temporal interference electric stimulation (tTIS), a noninvasive technique allowing to selectively neuromodulate deep brain structures. We applied tTIS to the right HC-EC in either continuous or intermittent theta-burst stimulation patterns (cTBS or iTBS), compared to a control condition, during a virtual reality–based spatial navigation task and concomitant functional magnetic resonance imaging. iTBS improved spatial navigation performance, correlated with hippocampal activity modulation, and decreased grid cell–like activity in EC. Collectively, these data provide the evidence that human HC-EC activity can be directly and noninvasively modulated leading to changes of spatial navigation behavior. These findings suggest promising perspectives for patients suffering from cognitive impairment such as following traumatic brain injury or dementia."

Ohashi;Michael Reedijk,Inhibition of Notch enhances efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in triple-negative breast cancer,"Aberrant Notch, which is a defining feature of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, regulates intercellular communication in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). This includes tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment through Notch-dependent cytokine secretion, contributing to an immunosuppressive TIME. Despite the low response rate of TNBC to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), here, we report that inhibition of Notch-driven cytokine-mediated programs reduces TAMs and induces responsiveness to sequentially delivered ICB. This is characterized by the emergence of GrB+cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the primary tumor. A more impressive effect of sequential treatment is observed in the lung where TAM depletion and increased CTLs are accompanied by near-complete abolition of metastases. This is due to (i) therapeutic reduction in Notch-dependent, prometastatic circulating factors released by the primary tumor, and (ii) elevated PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in lung metastases, rendering them profoundly sensitive to ICB. These findings highlight the potential of combination cytokine inhibition and ICB as an immunotherapeutic strategy in TNBC."

The long-standing vision of lakes as solely respirators of the organic matter leaking from the soils has been challenged by evidence that inorganic carbon produced by weathering of the catchment bedrock could also support lake CO2emissions. How inorganic carbon inputs ultimately generate lake CO2outgassing remains a blind spot. We develop and introduce a calcite module in a coupled one-dimensional physical-biogeochemical model that we use to simulate the carbon cycle of the large Lake Geneva over the past 40 years. We mechanistically demonstrate how the so-far neglected process of calcite precipitation boosts net CO2emissions at the annual scale. Far from being anecdotal, we show that calcite precipitation could explain CO2outgassing across various lakes globally, including some of the largest lakes in the world."

However, their impact on migration and mechanostability of highly adherent cells remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that loss of cortical actin filaments generated by the formins mDia1 and mDia3 drastically compromises cell migration and mechanics in highly adherent fibroblasts. Biophysical analysis of the mechanical properties of the mutant cells revealed a markedly softened cell cortex in the poorly adherent state. Unexpectedly, in the highly adherent state, associated with a hyperstretched morphology with exaggerated focal adhesions and prominent high-strain stress fibers, they exhibited even higher cortical tension compared to control. Notably, misguidance of intracellular forces, frequently accompanied by stress-fiber rupture, culminated in the formation of tension- and contractility-induced macroapertures, which was instantly followed by excessive lamellipodial protrusion at the periphery, providing critical insights into mechanotransduction of mechanically stressed and highly adherent cells."

In the crucial case of isothermal turbulence, the probability density function (PDF) of the logarithmic density,s, is well measured, but a theoretical understanding of the processes leading to this distribution remains elusive. We investigate these processes using Lagrangian tracer particles to tracksanddsdtin direct numerical simulations, and we show that their evolution can be modeled as a stochastic differential process with time-correlated noise. The temporal correlation functions ofsanddsdtdecay exponentially, as predicted by the model, and the decay timescale is ≈1/6the eddy turnover time. The behaviors of the conditional averages ofdsdtandd2sdt2are also well explained by the model, which shows that the density PDF arises from a balance between stochastic compressions/expansions, which tend to broaden the PDF, and the acceleration/deceleration of shocks by density gradients, which tends to narrow it."
