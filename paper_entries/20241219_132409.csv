10.5194/acp-24-14101-2024,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文探讨了城市公园的降温效果如何受到大气边界层稳定性影响。研究发现，在夏季热浪期间，夜间城市大气变得稳定，抑制了湍流运动。在这种情况下，城市公园和树林比周围的建筑区域降温效率更高，温度可低4至6°C，具体取决于公园的大小。研究人员使用气象站数据、小型无线电探空仪和多普勒风廓线雷达来量化几个城市公园和城市树林的降温效果，并确定了三种解释公园降温效果夜间变化的大气稳定性和混合机制。研究结果表明，城市绿地在热浪期间具有显著的降温潜力，夜间由于平流和混合输送过程最小，降温效果达到最大。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强，因为它主要关注城市地表特征（公园和建筑环境）与近地表大气之间的相互作用，而不是使用遥感技术来监测大气成分或质量。,"['urban heat island', 'park cooling effect', 'atmospheric stability', 'turbulent mixing', 'heat wave']",Martial Haeffelin;Jean-François Ribaud;Jonnathan Céspedes;Jean-Charles Dupont;Aude Lemonsu;Valéry Masson;Tim Nagel;Simone Kotthaus,Impact of boundary layer stability on urban park cooling effect intensity,"This study highlights how the state of the urban atmospheric boundary layer impacts urban park cooling effect intensity at night. Under summertime heat wave conditions, the urban atmosphere becomes stable at night, which inhibits turbulent motions. Under those specific conditions, urban parks and woods cool much more efficiently than the surrounding built-up neighbourhoods in the evening and through the night, providing cooler air temperatures by 4 to 6° C depending on park size. 
 The added heat in cities amplifies the health risks of heat waves. At night under calm winds and cloud-free skies, the air in the urban canopy layer can be several degrees warmer than in rural areas. This lower nocturnal cooling in the built-up settings poses severe health risks to the urban inhabitants, as indoor spaces cannot be ventilated effectively. With heat waves becoming more frequent and more intense in future climates, many cities are expanding their green spaces with the aim to introduce cooling through shading, evaporation and lower heat storage capacities. In this study, we assessed how the evening and nighttime cooling effect of urban parks (relative to nearby built-up settings) varies with the park size and the mesoscale atmospheric conditions during warm summer periods. Using a combination of meteorological surface station data and compact radiosondes, the cooling effect is quantified for several urban parks (about 15 ha) and urban woods (about 900 ha). A profiling Doppler wind lidar deployed in the city centre is used to measure turbulent vertical mixing conditions in the urban boundary layer. We find that the maximum nocturnal cooling effects in urban parks range around 1–5 °C during a 1-week heat wave event in mid-July 2022 but also in general during summer 2022 (June–August). Three atmospheric stability and mixing regimes are identified that explain the night-to-night variability in the park cooling effect. We find that very low turbulent vertical mixing in the urban boundary layer (<0.05 m2 s−2) results in the strongest evening cooling in both rural settings and urban parks and the weakest cooling in the built-up environment. This regime specifically occurs during heat waves in connection with large-scale advection of hot air over the region and corresponding subsidence. When nocturnal turbulent vertical mixing above the city is stronger, the evening cooling in urban green spaces is less efficient, so the atmospheric stratification above both urban parks and woods is less stable, and temperature contrasts compared to the built-up environment are less pronounced. These results highlight the fact that urban green spaces have a significant cooling potential during heat waves, with maximum effects at night as advection and mixing transport processes are minimal. This suggests adapting the opening hours of public parks to enable residents to benefit from these cooling islands."
10.5194/acp-24-14073-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文探讨了暖传送带（WCB）在大气水分输送中的作用，特别是快速上升气流的影响。WCB是中纬度气旋中将水汽输送到对流层上层和平流层下层（UTLS）的重要机制。水汽在UTLS中是一种重要的温室气体，WCB相关的卷云也会影响云辐射强迫。然而，控制WCB水分输送和云特性的过程尚不清楚。\n\n该研究使用对流允许模拟对WCB水分输送进行了拉格朗日研究。通过分析不同上升速度的空气轨迹，研究发现上升时间尺度对最终输送到UTLS的水分含量有重要影响。上升速度慢的空气轨迹由于较高的温度，输送的水汽更多。而上升速度快的空气轨迹则由于凝结物损失较少，输送的凝结物质量更大，并形成寿命更长的卷云。\n\n这项研究的意义在于，它揭示了上升时间尺度对WCB水分输送的影响，以及快速上升气流在将凝结物输送到UTLS中的重要性。这对于改进天气预报和气候预测模型具有重要意义，因为目前参数化对流的模型可能低估了这些过程的影响。,"['Atmospheric Composition', 'Water Vapor', 'Clouds', 'Cirrus Clouds', 'Upper Troposphere', 'Lower Stratosphere', 'UTLS', 'Moisture Transport', 'Warm Conveyor Belt', 'WCB', 'Extratropical Cyclones', 'Climate Modeling', 'Weather Forecasting']",Cornelis Schwenk;Annette Miltenberger,The role of ascent timescales for warm conveyor belt (WCB) moisture transport into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS),"Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) transport moisture into the upper atmosphere, where it acts as a greenhouse gas. This transport is not well understood, and the role of rapidly rising air is unclear. We simulate a WCB and look at fast- and slow-rising air to see how moisture is (differently) transported. We find that for fast-ascending air more ice particles reach higher into the atmosphere and that frozen cloud particles are removed differently than during slow ascent, which has more water vapour. 
 Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) are coherent ascending airstreams in extratropical cyclones. They are a major source of moisture for the extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), where moisture acts as a potent greenhouse gas and WCB-associated cirrus clouds contribute to cloud radiative forcing. However, the processes controlling WCB moisture transport and cloud properties are poorly characterised. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed (embedded) convection as a ubiquitous feature of WCBs, highlighting the importance of understanding their updraught and microphysical structure. We present a Lagrangian investigation of WCB moisture transport for a case from the WISE (Wave-driven ISentropic Exchange) campaign based on a convection-permitting simulation. Lagrangian non-dimensional metrics of the moisture budget suggest that the ascent timescale (τ600) strongly controls the end-of-ascent total moisture content, which is largest for slowly ascending trajectories (τ600≥20 h, 30 % of all WCB trajectories). This is due to relatively warm end-of-ascent temperatures and the strong temperature control on transported water vapour. Deviations from equilibrium water vapour condensate partitioning are largest for slow trajectories due to faster glaciation and lower ice crystal numbers. A local moisture transport minimum at intermediate τ600 results from a shift towards a riming-dominated precipitation formation pathway and decreasing outflow temperatures with decreasing τ600. The fastest trajectories (τ600≤5 h, 5 % of all WCB trajectories) transport the largest condensate mass to the UTLS due to less efficient condensate loss and produce the longest-lived outflow cirrus clouds. Models that parameterise convection may under-represent these processes, potentially impacting weather forecasts and climate predictions."
10.5194/amt-17-7077-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究如何利用卫星携带的宽视场辐射计来测量地球的能量不平衡，从而推断全球年平均能量不平衡和年际变化趋势。地球能量不平衡指的是入射太阳辐射和地球反射及发射辐射之间的差值，它是气候变化的主要驱动因素。由于能量不平衡的数值很小，并且是两个大通量之间的差值，直接测量非常困难。论文模拟了不同轨道类型的卫星（极地轨道、太阳同步轨道和进动轨道）以及这些轨道的组合，发现单颗卫星无法提供足够的采样来可靠地确定全球年平均能量不平衡。为了降低测量的不确定性，需要至少两颗甚至多颗卫星进行互补观测，以确保全球覆盖和充分采样昼夜和年度循环。这项研究对于未来卫星任务的设计和规划具有重要意义，可以帮助更精确地测量地球能量不平衡，从而更好地理解和应对气候变化。,"[""Earth's energy imbalance"", 'Satellite observations', 'Radiometers', 'Climate change', 'Radiation budget', 'Sampling', 'Orbits']",Thomas Hocking;Thorsten Mauritsen;Linda Megner,Sampling the diurnal and annual cycles of the Earth's energy imbalance with constellations of satellite-borne radiometers,"The imbalance between the energy the Earth absorbs from the Sun and the energy the Earth emits back into space gives rise to climate change, but measuring the small imbalance is challenging. We simulate satellites in various orbits to investigate how well they sample the imbalance and find that the best option is to combine at least two satellites that see complementary parts of the Earth and cover the daily and annual cycles. This information is useful when planning future satellite missions. 
 The Earth's energy imbalance, i.e. the difference between incoming solar radiation and outgoing reflected and emitted radiation, is the one quantity that ultimately controls the evolution of our climate system. However, despite its importance, there is limited knowledge of the exact magnitude of the energy imbalance, and the small net difference of about 1 W m−2 between two large fluxes (approximately 340 W m−2) makes it challenging to measure directly. There has recently been renewed interest in using wide-field-of-view radiometers on board satellites to measure the outgoing radiation, as a possible method for deducing the global annual mean energy imbalance. Here we investigate how to sample in order to correctly determine the global annual mean imbalance and interannual trends, using a limited number of satellites. We  simulate satellites in polar (90° inclination), sun-synchronous (98°) and precessing orbits (73, 82°), as well as constellations of these types of satellite orbits. We find that no single satellite provides sufficient sampling, both globally and of the diurnal and annual cycles, to reliably determine the global annual mean. If sun-synchronous satellites are used, at least six satellites are required for an uncertainty below 1 W m−2. One precessing satellite combined with one polar satellite results in root-mean-square errors of 0.08 to 0.10 W m−2, and a combination of two or three polar satellites results in root-mean-square errors of 0.10 or 0.04 W m−2, respectively. In conclusion, at least two satellites that complement each other are necessary to ensure global coverage and achieve a sampling uncertainty well below the current estimate of the energy imbalance."

Link;Rileigh Robertson;Tyler Boyle;Dustin Poppendieck,Methodology and uncertainty estimation for measurements of methane leakage in a manufactured house,"Methane leaks into houses that use natural gas from appliances, pipes, and fittings. We measured methane emitted from a manufactured house under different ventilation conditions using indoor and outdoor concentration measurements. We injected methane at prescribed rates into the house and then measured the emissions using our method. We report the error in the calculation based on these tests. We also describe the method and provide guidance on conducting this type of experiment. 
 Methane emissions from natural gas appliances and infrastructure within buildings have historically not been captured in greenhouse gas inventories, leading to under-estimates, especially in urban areas. Recent measurements of these post-meter emissions have indicated non-negligible emissions within residences, with impacts on both indoor air quality and climate. As a result, methane losses from residential buildings have been included in the latest US national inventory, with emission factors determined from a single study of homes in California. To facilitate future additional studies investigating building methane emissions, we conducted a controlled experiment to document a methodology for such measurements and estimated associated uncertainties. We determined whole-house methane emission rates with a mass balance approach using near-simultaneous measurements of indoor and outdoor methane mole fractions at a manufactured house. We quantified the uncertainty in whole-house methane emission rates by varying the forced outdoor air ventilation rate of the manufactured house, measuring the outdoor air change rate using both sulfur hexafluoride and carbon dioxide tracers, and performing methane injections at prescribed rates. We found that the whole-house quiescent methane emission rate (i.e., emission rate when all gas appliances were off) in the manufactured house averaged 0.33 g d−1 with methodological errors in the calculated emission rates of approximately 19 % (root-mean-square deviation). We also measured the quiescent leakage from the manufactured house over 3 months to find 26 % (1σ) variability in emissions over two seasons. Our findings can be used to inform plans for future studies quantifying indoor methane losses downstream of residential meters using similar methods. Such quantification studies are sorely needed to better understand building methane emissions and their drivers to inform inventories and plan mitigation strategies."

Its data has improved weather forecasting, with Mie-cloudy winds proving especially precise. Challenges emerged, such as unexpected misalignments in signal angles and reduced signal levels due to beam clipping and laser issues. Lessons from Aeolus highlight the need for better optical alignment and active control systems for future lidar missions. 
 This paper presents an extensive investigation of the signal fringe profile for the Fizeau interferometer used in the first spaceborne wind lidar Aeolus, and considers the fundamental implications for the wind measurement accuracy in Aeolus and future systems. The early Aeolus design phase considered that the basic fringe would be made up of a Fizeau instrumental component of ≈ 100 MHz (FWHM), folded with the laser pulse spectral width of ≈ 50 MHz (FWHM), both of Lorentzian form. Fringe anomalies observed before the mission and related to surface defects in the interferometer plates, triggered the development of wave-optic methods for analysis of the fringe formation. These methods, herein described in an instructional Appendix, were subsequently found to be essential for rigorous modelling of complex fringes for different physical and optical arrangements. Initial signal returns from Aeolus suggested that the Fizeau fringe profile was in fact broadened with a large Gaussian component. The laser pulse was subsequently shown to have a profile close to Gaussian of ≈ 45 MHz (FWHM) and thus provided a partial contribution. However, detailed examination of experimental Aeolus fringes constructed from ground return signals, showed a large Gaussian component up to ≈ 130 MHz (FWHM). Wave-optic modelling established that Fizeau ""aperture broadening"", of this form and magnitude, would be generated for the input signal beam of 500 µrad field of view set at large angles of incidence of 300 µrad. These findings have strong implications for fringe shift and wind measurement accuracy, as given in the quantum limited Cramer-Rao expression and the paramount importance of minimising line width. Extensive modelling and simulation for the broadened profiles calculated above, shows good agreement with measured Aeolus global wind measurement accuracies, and indicates that loss of signal could be due to beam clipping at the field stop for such large AOI. It is established that optimisation of the present Aeolus Fizeau parameters could lead to a factor of 2.5 improvement in wind measurement precision. Future upgrades of the Fizeau interferometer and the laser within reasonable parameters, suggest the potential for an factor of 7.6 improvement on the present performance."

 The Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) of the European Union (EU) presents a rich resource for detailed understanding of land cover and use, making it invaluable for Earth observation (EO) applications. This paper discusses the recent enhancements and improvements in the LUCAS Copernicus module, particularly the data collection process of 2022, its protocol simplifications, and geometry definitions compared to the 2018 survey and data. With approximately 150 000 polygons collected in 2022, an increase from 60 000 in 2018, the LUCAS Copernicus 2022 data provide a unique and comprehensive in situ dataset for EO applications. The protocol simplification also facilitates a faster and more efficient data collection process. In 2022, there were 137 966 polygons generated out of the original 149 408 LUCAS Copernicus points, which means that 92.3 % of the points were actually surveyed.

These can be valuable for filling observational data gaps and advancing our understanding of TC climatology, thereby facilitating risk assessments and defenses against TC-related disasters. 
 Tropical cyclones (TCs) are powerful weather systems that can cause extreme disasters. The International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) dataset provides widely used data to estimate TC climatology. However, it has low data coverage, lacking intensity and outer-size data for more than half of all recorded storms, and is therefore insufficient as a reference for researchers and decision makers. To fill this data gap, we reconstruct a long-term TC dataset by integrating IBTrACS and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) data. This reconstructed dataset covers the period 1959–2022, with 3 h temporal resolution. Compared to the IBTrACS dataset, it contains approximately 3–4 times more data points per characteristic. We establish machine learning models to estimate the maximum sustained wind speed (Vmax) and radius of maximum wind (Rmax) in six basins for which TCs are generated, using ERA5-derived 10 m azimuthal mean azimuthal wind profiles as input, with Vmax and Rmax data from the IBTrACS dataset used as learning target data. Furthermore, we employ an empirical wind–pressure relationship and six wind profile models to estimate the minimum central pressure (Pmin) and outer size of the TCs, respectively. Overall, this high-resolution TC reconstruction dataset demonstrates global consistency with observations, exhibiting mean biases of <1 % for Vmax and 3 % for Rmax and Pmin in almost all basins. The dataset is publicly available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13919874 (Xu et al., 2024) and substantially advances our understanding of TC climatology, thereby facilitating risk assessments and defenses against TC-related disasters."

 Development of long-term continues, consistent and high-quality satellite remote sensing aerosol and surface products is crucial to constrain climate models and improve our understanding on climate change.

The obtained POSP/GF-5(02) aerosol and surface products are validated and intercompared with ground-based AERONET reference aerosol dataset and other independent satellite products, such as NOAA-20 VIIRS/DB aerosol product and MODIS MCD43 surface product. The results show generally good consistency of POSP products with AERONET, VIIRS/NOAA-20 aerosol dataset and MODIS surface product. Moreover, it is possible to conclude the developed POSP product includes reliable estimates of not only total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), but also detailed properties of aerosol such as aerosol size, absorption, layer height, type, etc., as well as full surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Function (BPDF), and black-sky, white-sky albedos and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These parameters are of high importance to constrain the Earth-atmosphere radiation budget. The retrieval of these properties seems to be possible due to the polarimetric capabilities and wide UV-VIS-NIR-SWIR spectral range of from POSP observations and advances of used GRASP/Models retrieval approach.

This study introduces a high-time-resolution (approximately 15 minutes) dataset of vertical profile observations of atmospheric composition (aerosol, NO2, and HCHO) conducted using passive remote sensing technology across 32 sites in seven major regions of China from 2019 to 2023. The study meticulously documents the vertical distribution, seasonal variations and diurnal pattern of these pollutants, revealing long-term trends in atmospheric composition across various regions of China. This dataset provides essential scientific evidence for regional environmental management and policy-making. Its sharing would facilitate the scientific community in exploring of source-receptor relationships, investigating the impacts of atmospheric composition on regional and global climate and feedback mechanisms. It also holds potential for enhancing satellite retrieval methods and advancing the development of regional transport models. The dataset is available for free at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14194965; Jiao et al., 2024)."

 As one of the most widely cultivated grain crops, paddy rice is a vital staple food in China and plays a crucial role in ensuring food security. Over the past decades, the planting area of paddy rice in China has shown substantial variability. Yet, there are no long-term high-resolution rice distribution maps in China, which hinders our ability to estimate greenhouse gas fluxes and crop production.

The model can reproduce PAH distribution well. The concentration of BaP (indicator species for PAHs) could exceed the target values of 1 ng m-3 over some areas (e.g., in central Europe, India, and eastern China). The change in BaP is lower than that in PM2.5 from 2013 to 2018. China still faces significant potential health risks posed by BaP although the Action Plan has been implemented. 
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) significantly impact human health due to their persistence, toxicity, and potential carcinogenicity. Their global distribution and regional changes caused by emission changes, especially over areas in developing countries, remain to be understood along with their health impacts. This study implemented a PAH module in the global–regional nested Atmospheric Aerosol and Chemistry Model of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP-AACM) to investigate the global distribution of PAHs and the change in their health risks from 2013 to 2018 in China. An evaluation against observations showed that the model could capture well the spatial distribution and seasonal variation in Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), the typical indicator species of PAHs. On a global scale, the annual mean concentrations are the highest in China followed by Europe and India, with high values exceeding the target values of 1 ng m−3 over some areas. Compared with 2013, the concentration of BaP in China decreased in 2018 due to emission reductions, whereas it increased in India and southern Africa. However, the decline is much smaller than for PM2.5 during the same period. The concentration of BaP decreased by 8.5 % in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) and 9.4 % in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). It even increased over areas in the Sichuan Basin due to changes in meteorological conditions. The total incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) posed by BaP only showed a slight decrease in 2018, and the population in east China still faced significant potential health risks. The results indicate that strict additional control measures should be taken to reduce the pollution and health risks of PAHs effectively. The study also highlights the importance of considering changes in meteorological conditions when evaluating emission changes from concentration monitoring."

We found that the model did well simulating past ocean conditions like temperature, and nutrient and oxygen levels, and can even reproduce metrics used by and important to ecosystem managers. 
 Regional ocean models enable generation of computationally-affordable and regionally-tailored ensembles of near-term forecasts and long-term projections of sufficient resolution to serve marine resource management. Climate change, however, has created marine resource challenges, such as shifting stock distributions, that cut across domestic and international management boundaries and have pushed regional modeling efforts toward “coastwide” approaches. Here we present and evaluate a multidecadal hindcast with a Northeast Pacific (NEP) regional implementation of the Modular Ocean Model version 6 with sea ice and biogeochemistry that extends from the Chukchi Sea to the Baja California Peninsula at 10-km horizontal resolution (MOM6-COBALT-NEP10k, or “NEP10k”). This domain includes an Arctic-adjacent system with a broad shallow shelf seasonally covered by sea ice (the Eastern Bering Sea, EBS), a sub-Arctic system with upwelling in the Alaska Gyre and predominant downwelling winds and large freshwater forcing along the coast (the Gulf of Alaska, GoA), and a temperate, eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem (the California Current Ecosystem, CCE). The coastwide model was able to recreate seasonal and cross-ecosystem contrasts in numerous ecosystem-critical properties including temperature, salinity, inorganic nutrients, oxygen, carbonate saturation states, and chlorophyll. Spatial consistency between modeled quantities and observations generally extended to plankton ecosystems, though small to moderate biases were also apparent. Fidelity with observed zooplankton biomass, for example, was limited to first-order seasonal and cross-system contrasts. Temporally, simulated monthly surface and bottom temperature anomalies in coastal regions (< 500 m deep) closely matched estimates from data-assimilative ocean reanalyses. Performance, however, was reduced in some nearshore regions coarsely resolved by the model’s 10-km resolution grid, and the time series of satellite-based chlorophyll anomaly estimates proved more difficult to match than temperature. System-specific ecosystem indicators were also assessed. In the EBS, NEP10k robustly matched observed variations, including recent large declines, in the area of the summer bottom water “cold pool” (< 2 °C) which exerts a profound influence on EBS fisheries. In the GoA, the simulation captured patterns of sea surface height variability and variations in thermal, oxygen and acidification risk associated with local modes of inter-annual to decadal climate variability. In the CCE, the simulation robustly captured variations in upwelling indices and coastal water masses, though discrepancies in the latter were evident in the Southern California Bight. Enhanced model resolution may reduce such discrepancies, but any benefits must be carefully weighed against computational costs given the intended use of this system for ensemble predictions and projections. Meanwhile, the demonstrated NEP10k skill level herein, particularly in recreating cross-ecosystem contrasts and the time variation of ecosystem indicators over multiple decades, suggests considerable immediate utility for coastwide retrospective and predictive applications."

The model is described in detail and evaluated against grid-resolved urban canopy simulations, demonstrating its ability to model urban surfaces accurately. By bridging the gap between computational efficiency and physical detail, PALM-SLUrb broadens PALM's potential for urban climate research. 
 Urban areas are recognized as critical zones for climate research due to the high number of people living in these areas and their significant impacts on local and regional climates. However, understanding urban boundary layer processes remains a challenge, as existing mesoscale models cannot resolve their fine-scale features and dynamics, while microscale fluid dynamics simulations remain computationally expensive or unfeasible for the full extent of the urban atmosphere. To address this gap, we present PALM-SLUrb, a single-layer urban canopy model for the PALM model system, offering a computationally efficient and physics-based model to represent urban surfaces on non-building-resolving grids. Together with the model description, we present sensitivity tests and a model comparison against grid-resolved urban canopies to demonstrate the model’s performance. The results demonstrate the model's ability to extend the representation of key urban–atmosphere interactions in PALM into coarser grid resolutions on the order of 10 metres.

Our simulations demonstrate that chlorine chemistry increases the annual mean boundary layer SOA by 5–12% over most continents while decreasing SOA by 5–11% over northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans, which are in the right direction to narrow existing discrepancies between models and observations. Notably, sensitivity simulations in China with observed high chlorine levels capture the temporal variations of both observed fine Cl– and organic aerosol, showing an increase in SOA by more than 100%.

We then show how this framework can be extended to other processes, such as those employing dilution schemes.

Ultrafine particle formation occurred when cannabis smoke was exposed to ozone levels greater than 10 ppb, over the entire observed primary particle concentration range (1030–4580 μg m–3).

Here, we interestingly found that LDR specifically elevated the percentage of CD4+IFNγ+ Th1 splenocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, without affecting the percentage of CD8+IFNγ+ Tc1 cells and regulatory T cells. A similar phenomenon was found in T cells from peripheral blood. Mechanistically, we found that LDR can induce mitochondrial damage, which stimulated the STING signaling pathway, leading to the enhanced expression of T-bet, the master transcriptional factor of Th1-cell differentiation. The specific STING signal inhibitor can abrogate the effect of LDR on Th1 differentiation, confirming the central role of the STING pathway. To further validate the immunoregulatory role of LDR, we exposed mice with whole body LDR and evaluated if LDR could protect mice against triple-negative breast cancer through enhanced antitumor immunity. As expected, LDR significantly delayed tumor development and promoted cell death. Meanwhile, LDR resulted in increased tumor-infiltrating Th1 cells, while the proportion of Tc1 and Treg cells remained unchanged. Furthermore, the infiltration of antitumor macrophages was also increased. In summary, we revealed that environmental LDR could specifically regulate Th1 T-cell activities, providing critical information for the potential application of LDR in both clinical and nonclinical settings."

The extracellular organic matter (EOM) secreted by algae omnipresent in eutrophic waters may affect MnOx dissolution thus the fate of organic micropollutants. This study investigates the mechanisms of MnOx reductive dissolution mediated by EOM and examines the effects of this process on 17α-ethinylestradiol degradation. The influences of EOM concentration (1.0–20.0 mgC/L) and pH (6.0–9.0) in both dark and irradiated conditions were assessed. In the dark, EOM was found to facilitate MnOx reductive dissolution via the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). The dissolution was further enhanced under irradiation, with the participation of superoxide ions (O2•–). Higher EOM concentrations increased the contents of available reducing substances and O2•–, accelerating the reductive dissolution. Higher pH slowed the photoreductive dissolution rates, while O2•–-mediated reduction became more important. Polyphenols and highly unsaturated carbon and phenolic formulas in EOM were found to drive the reductive dissolution. Soluble reactive Mn(III) formed through reductive dissolution of MnOx effectively removed 17α-ethinylestradiol in solution. Overall, the findings regarding the mechanisms behind reductive dissolution of MnOx have broad implications for Mn geochemical cycles and organic micropollutant fate."

Thus, there is a need to better understand contaminant movement and human exposure to wildfire smoke. Vapor-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are elevated during wildfires, but little is known about how these chemicals move during and after wildfire events for exposure risk assessment. Paired air and soil pore air passive samplers were deployed before, during, and after wildfires to determine diffusive flux of vapor-phase parent (p-PAH) and alkylated (a-PAH) PAHs in the Western United States. Naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene contributed to most of the volatilization and deposition (6.3–89%) before and after a wildfire. Retene (41%) and phenanthrene (27%) contributed substantially to deposition during a wildfire. During wildfires, the number of PAHs in deposition increased at sites with worse air quality. Most p-PAHs and a-PAHs were either depositing or near equilibrium after a wildfire, except for retene at several locations. A majority (≥50%) of PAHs had a 50% magnitude difference between flux before and after a wildfire.

Here, we investigated the hydrolysis patterns of PPDs by analyzing their hydrolysis half-lives, hydrolysis products around neutral pH (pH 6.0–7.7), and the role of atoms within the C–N bonds in PPDs. Hydrolysis preferentially targets the aromatic secondary amine N with the strongest proton affinity and the C atom of C–N with the highest nucleophilic-attack reactivity. The hydrolysis half-life (t1/2) shortens when the maximum proton affinity of N increases. These results are supported by theoretical calculations, demonstrating a hydrolysis reaction propelled by proton transfer from water to N and complemented by aromatic nucleophilic substitution of N in C–N by water hydroxyl. With the experimental results and the atom reactivity-based predictive model, the t1/2 around neutral pH for 60 PPDs (monitored in environment, commercially available, or under investigation) is determined, showing variations ranging from 2.2 h to 47 days.

Placental trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles (T-EVs) could transport to the fetus through maternal-fetal circulation. TPhP significantly upregulated the protein level of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in T-EVs.

Meanwhile, in vitro experiments verified that TPhP upregulated PPARγ in HTR8/SVneo cells derived EVs, and these EVs promoted adipogenesis in preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. Knock down of PPARγ in HTR8/SVneo could alleviate the adipogenensis effects of EVs derived from TPhP exposed HTR8/SVneo cells.

However, whether ROS can be generated during redox manipulation in activated sludge wastewater treatment processes (AS-WTPs) and the underlying impacts remain largely unknown. This study demonstrates that ROS production is ubiquitous in AS-WTPs due to redox manipulation and that the frequency and capacity of ROS production depend on the operating modes. The anaerobic/oxic continuous-flow reactor showed persistent ROS generation (0.8–2.1 μM of instantaneous H2O2), whereas the oxic/anoxic sequencing batch reactor (0.21–0.28 mM of H2O2 per cycle) and the anaerobic/anoxic digestion reactor (0.27–0.29 mM of H2O2 per cycle) exhibited periodic ROS production. Our results illustrated that ROS generated during redox manipulation can contribute to the removal of organic micropollutants. Due to their high activity, ROS can directly accelerate the abiotic oxidation of organic phenolics and Fe(II) minerals in sludges. ROS could also affect biotic nitrification by changing the microbial community composition and regulating the relative expression of functional genes, such as amoA, nrxA, and nrxB.

Fluoroelastomers, which are considered a polymeric form of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), have historically involved the use of shorter-chain PFAS as surfactants in the polymerization process. In this study, 22 watch bands were analyzed across numerous brands and price points for the presence of PFAS. Products were first screened for total fluorine using particle-induced gamma-ray emission spectroscopy on the surface of these bands, and 15 of the 22 watch bands contained total F concentrations >1% fluorine, suggesting the widespread use of fluoroelastomers in this product category. Watch bands then underwent solvent extraction and targeted LC-MS/MS analysis for 20 PFAS. Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) was the most frequently detected compound with concentrations from <LoD to 16662 ng/g. A subset of six watch bands also underwent direct total oxidative precursor (dTOP) assay to determine the presence of PFAS precursors.

However, a more prominent atmospheric blocking high (i.e., Alaskan Ridge) initiated and intensified the extreme heat during the second winter warm spell. Increased incoming solar radiation and positive sensible heat flux due to a dry surface fostered extreme heat during the second winter warm spell event.

Reliable MO data sets of air temperature (Ta), water vapor density (WVD) and relative humidity (RH) with high spatio‐temporal resolution over the TP were obtained and assimilated to improve precipitation forecast using the four‐dimensional variational (4DVAR) data assimilation (DA) method. The results show that Ta, WVD and RH profile data retrieved with the mobile microwave radiometer (MR) are credible over the TP. The atmospheric vertical structure measured by the mobile MR can reproduce the spatio‐temporal evolution characteristics of water vapor transport, temperature stratification and cloud structure. The distribution pattern of 24‐hr accumulated rainfall prediction with Ta profile DA was closer to measurements, and 6–12 hr forecasts for low to moderate rainfall in the central and western regions of Qinghai province were improved significantly. Data assimilation with air temperature retrievals from mobile MR observations were found beneficial for accurate simulation of water vapor transport, convergence and divergence of wind field, and upward motion associated with precipitation events.

Most studies documenting the impacts of CAFOs rely almost exclusively on CAFO locations known from incomplete public records. Poultry CAFOs generate dry waste and operate without federal permits; thus, their environmental justice (EJ) impacts are undocumented. North Carolina (NC), a leading poultry producer, has seen a significant increase in poultry CAFOs, particularly since the 1997 swine CAFO moratorium. Using literature‐derived heuristics, this study refined the locations of poultry CAFOs derived based on Earth Observation (EO) data and deep learning, reducing the overestimation of poultry CAFO density by 54% after heuristic adjustments. We removed 51.8% of misclassified features in NC and 61.5% across the US, significantly improving data set accuracy. Spatial analysis, including Local Indicators of Spatial Association, revealed that poultry CAFOs often cluster in census tracts with high Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) scores, indicating potential EJ issues. Notably, one‐third of NC's census tracts with high poultry CAFO density also have high SVI, primarily in rural eastern regions. Similar patterns were observed in the South and Southeast of the US. However, not all high‐density CAFO areas correspond with high SVI, suggesting a complex relationship between CAFO locations and community vulnerabilities. This study highlights the critical need for comprehensive, high‐quality data on unpermitted poultry CAFOs derived using AI algorithms to fully understand their impacts on communities and accurately inform EJ evaluations."

 Human treponemal infections are caused by a family of closely related Treponema pallidum that give rise to the diseases yaws, bejel, pinta and, most famously, syphilis1. Debates on both a common origin for these pathogens and the history of syphilis itself has weighed evidence for the “Columbian hypothesis”2, which argues for an American origin, against that for the “pre-Columbian hypothesis”3, which argues for presence of the disease in Eurasia in the Medieval period and possibly earlier. While molecular data has provided a genetic basis for distinction of the typed subspecies4, deep evolution of the complex has remained unresolved due to limitations in the conclusions that can be drawn from the sparse paleogenomic data currently available. Here we explore this evolutionary history through analyses of five pre- and peri-contact ancient treponemal genomes from the Americas that represent ancient relatives of the T. pallidum pallidum (syphilis), T. pallidum pertenue (yaws) and T. pallidum endemicum (bejel) lineages. Our data indicate unexplored diversity and an emergence of T. pallidum that post-dates human occupation in the Americas. Together these results support an American origin for all T. pallidum characterized at the genomic level, both modern and ancient."

 Diamond is an exceptional material with great potential across various fields owing to its interesting properties1,2. However, despite extensive efforts over the past decades3–5, producing large quantities of desired ultrathin diamond membranes for widespread use remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that edge-exposed exfoliation using sticky tape is a simple, scalable and reliable method for producing ultrathin and transferable polycrystalline diamond membranes. Our approach enables the mass production of large-area (2-inch wafer), ultrathin (sub-micrometre thickness), ultraflat (sub-nano surface roughness) and ultraflexible (360° bendable) diamond membranes. These high-quality membranes, which have a flat workable surface, support standard micromanufacturing techniques, and their ultraflexible nature allows for direct elastic strain engineering and deformation sensing applications, which is not possible with their bulky counterpart. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the quality of the exfoliated membranes depends on the peeling angle and membrane thickness, for which largely intact diamond membranes can be robustly produced within an optimal operation window. This single-step method, which opens up new avenues for the mass production of high-figure-of-merit diamond membranes, is expected to accelerate the commercialization and arrival of the diamond era in electronics, photonics and other related fields.

 Cellular identity requires the concerted action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) bound together to enhancers of cell-type-specific genes. Despite TFs recognizing specific DNA motifs within accessible chromatin, this information is insufficient to explain how TFs select enhancers1. Here we compared four different TF combinations that induce different cell states, analysing TF genome occupancy, chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning and 3D genome organization at the nucleosome resolution. We show that motif recognition on mononucleosomes can decipher only the individual binding of TFs. When bound together, TFs act cooperatively or competitively to target nucleosome arrays with defined 3D organization, displaying motifs in particular patterns. In one combination, motif directionality funnels TF combinatorial binding along chromatin loops, before infiltrating laterally to adjacent enhancers. In other combinations, TFs assemble on motif-dense and highly interconnected loop junctions, and subsequently translocate to nearby lineage-specific sites. We propose a guided-search model in which motif grammar on nucleosome fibres acts as signpost elements, directing TF combinatorial binding to enhancers.

 Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention used to promote health and longevity1,2. CR causes various metabolic changes in both the production and the circulation of metabolites1; however, it remains unclear which altered metabolites account for the physiological benefits of CR. Here we use metabolomics to analyse metabolites that exhibit changes in abundance during CR and perform subsequent functional validation. We show that lithocholic acid (LCA) is one of the metabolites that alone can recapitulate the effects of CR in mice. These effects include activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), enhancement of muscle regeneration and rejuvenation of grip strength and running capacity. LCA also activates AMPK and induces life-extending and health-extending effects in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. As C. elegans and D. melanogaster are not able to synthesize LCA, these results indicate that these animals are able to transmit the signalling effects of LCA once administered. Knockout of AMPK abrogates LCA-induced phenotypes in all the three animal models. Together, we identify that administration of the CR-mediated upregulated metabolite LCA alone can confer anti-ageing benefits to metazoans in an AMPK-dependent manner. Lithocholic acid is one of the metabolites upregulated during calorie restriction, and treatment of mice, worms and flies with this bile acid alone can reproduce the health benefits of calorie restriction."

 Lithocholic acid (LCA) is accumulated in mammals during calorie restriction and it can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to slow down ageing1. However, the molecular details of how LCA activates AMPK and induces these biological effects are unclear. Here we show that LCA enhances the activity of sirtuins to deacetylate and subsequently inhibit vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase), which leads to AMPK activation through the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway. Proteomics analyses of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) identified TUB-like protein 3 (TULP3), a sirtuin-interacting protein2, as a LCA receptor. In detail, LCA-bound TULP3 allosterically activates sirtuins, which then deacetylate the V1E1 subunit of v-ATPase on residues K52, K99 and K191. Muscle-specific expression of a V1E1 mutant (3KR), which mimics the deacetylated state, strongly activates AMPK and rejuvenates muscles in aged mice. In nematodes and flies, LCA depends on the TULP3 homologues tub-1 and ktub, respectively, to activate AMPK and extend lifespan and healthspan. Our study demonstrates that activation of the TULP3–sirtuin–v-ATPase–AMPK pathway by LCA reproduces the benefits of calorie restriction. The molecular mechanism underlying how lithocholic acid recapitulates the lifespan and healthspan benefits of calorie restriction is revealed to involve TULP3, sirtuins, v-ATPase and AMPK."

 RNA conformational diversity has fundamental biological roles1–5, but direct visualization of its full conformational space in solution has not been possible using traditional biophysical techniques. Using solution atomic force microscopy, a deep neural network and statistical analyses, we show that the ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA adopts heterogeneous conformations consisting of a conformationally invariant core and highly flexible peripheral structural elements that sample a broad conformational space, with amplitudes as large as 20–60 Å in a multitude of directions, with very low net energy cost. Increasing Mg2+ drives compaction and enhances enzymatic activity, probably by narrowing the conformational space. Moreover, analyses of the correlations and anticorrelations between spatial flexibility and sequence conservation suggest that the functional roles of both the structure and dynamics of key regions are embedded in the primary sequence. These findings reveal the structure–dynamics basis for the embodiment of both enzymatic precision and substrate promiscuity in the RNA component of the RNase P.

 After nearly 50 years of searching, the vacuum ultraviolet 229Th nuclear isomeric transition has recently been directly laser excited1,2 and measured with high spectroscopic precision3. Nuclear clocks based on this transition are expected to be more robust4,5 than and may outperform6,7 current optical atomic clocks. These clocks also promise sensitive tests for new physics beyond the standard model5,8–12. In light of these important advances and applications, a substantial increase in the need for 229Th spectroscopy targets in several platforms is anticipated. However, the growth and handling of high-concentration 229Th-doped crystals5 used in previous measurements1–3,13,14 are challenging because of the scarcity and radioactivity of the 229Th material. Here we demonstrate a potentially scalable solution to these problems by performing laser excitation of the nuclear transition in 229ThF4 thin films grown using a physical vapour deposition process, consuming only micrograms of 229Th material. The 229ThF4 thin films are intrinsically compatible with photonics platforms and nanofabrication tools for integration with laser sources and detectors, paving the way for an integrated and field-deployable solid-state nuclear clock with radioactivity up to three orders of magnitude smaller than typical 229Th-doped crystals1–3,13. The high nuclear emitter density in 229ThF4 also potentially enables quantum optics studies in a new regime.

 The global aim to move away from fossil fuels requires efficient, inexpensive and sustainable energy storage to fully use renewable energy sources. Thermal energy storage materials1,2 in combination with a Carnot battery3–5 could revolutionize the energy storage sector. However, a lack of stable, inexpensive and energy-dense thermal energy storage materials impedes the advancement of this technology. Here we report the first, to our knowledge, ‘trimodal’ material that synergistically stores large amounts of thermal energy by integrating three distinct energy storage modes—latent, thermochemical and sensible. The eutectic mixture of boric and succinic acids undergoes a transition at around 150 °C, with a record high reversible thermal energy uptake of 394 ± 5% J g−1. We show that the transition involves melting of the boric acid component, which simultaneously undergoes dehydration into metaboric acid and water that dissolve into the liquid. Being retained in the liquid state allows the metaboric acid to readily rehydrate to re-form boric acid on cooling. Thermal stability is demonstrated over 1,000 heating–cooling cycles. The material is very low cost, environmentally friendly and sustainable.

 Aquatic life is strongly structured by the distribution of light, which, besides attenuation in intensity, exhibits a continuous change in the spectrum with depth1. The extent to which these light changes are perceived by phytoplankton through photoreceptors is still inadequately known. We addressed this issue by integrating functional studies of diatom phytochrome (DPH) photoreceptors in model species2 with environmental surveys of their distribution and activity. Here, by developing an in vivo dose–response assay to light spectral variations mediated by DPH, we show that DPH can trigger photoreversible responses across the entire light spectrum, resulting in a change in DPH photoequilibrium with depth. By generating dph mutants in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, we also demonstrate that under simulated low-blue-light conditions of ocean depth, DPH regulates photosynthesis acclimation, thus linking optical depth detection with a functional response. The latitudinal distribution of DPH-containing diatoms from permanently stratified regions to seasonally mixed regions suggests an adaptive value of DPH functions in coping with vertical displacements in the water column.

 Old age is associated with a decline in cognitive function and an increase in neurodegenerative disease risk1. Brain ageing is complex and is accompanied by many cellular changes2. Furthermore, the influence that aged cells have on neighbouring cells and how this contributes to tissue decline is unknown. More generally, the tools to systematically address this question in ageing tissues have not yet been developed. Here we generate a spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics brain atlas of 4.2 million cells from 20 distinct ages across the adult lifespan and across two rejuvenating interventions—exercise and partial reprogramming. We build spatial ageing clocks, machine learning models trained on this spatial transcriptomics atlas, to identify spatial and cell-type-specific transcriptomic fingerprints of ageing, rejuvenation and disease, including for rare cell types. Using spatial ageing clocks and deep learning, we find that T cells, which increasingly infiltrate the brain with age, have a marked pro-ageing proximity effect on neighbouring cells. Surprisingly, neural stem cells have a strong pro-rejuvenating proximity effect on neighbouring cells. We also identify potential mediators of the pro-ageing effect of T cells and the pro-rejuvenating effect of neural stem cells on their neighbours. These results suggest that rare cell types can have a potent influence on their neighbours and could be targeted to counter tissue ageing. Spatial ageing clocks represent a useful tool for studying cell–cell interactions in spatial contexts and should allow scalable assessment of the efficacy of interventions for ageing and disease.

 Controlling the functional properties of quantum materials with light has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, leading to the discovery of various light-induced phases of matter, such as superconductivity1, ferroelectricity2,3, magnetism4–6 and charge density waves7. However, in most cases, the photoinduced phases return to equilibrium on ultrafast timescales after the light is turned off, limiting their practical applications. Here we use intense terahertz pulses to induce a metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature approaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical order parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the extended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a specific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours a ground state with finite magnetization near the Néel temperature. This analysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant antiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the new magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of the magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using terahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced order parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden quantum states. Intense terahertz pulses are used to induce metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, FePS3."

 The formation of the vertebrate body involves the coordinated production of trunk tissues from progenitors located in the posterior of the embryo. Although in vitro models using pluripotent stem cells replicate aspects of this process1–10, they lack crucial components, most notably the notochord—a defining feature of chordates that patterns surrounding tissues11. Consequently, cell types dependent on notochord signals are absent from current models of human trunk formation. Here we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of chick embryos to map molecularly distinct progenitor populations and their spatial organization. Guided by this map, we investigated how differentiating human pluripotent stem cells develop a stereotypical spatial organization of trunk cell types. We found that YAP inactivation in conjunction with FGF-mediated MAPK signalling facilitated WNT pathway activation and induced expression of TBXT (also known as BRA). In addition, timely inhibition of WNT-induced NODAL and BMP signalling regulated the proportions of different tissue types, including notochordal cells. This enabled us to create a three-dimensional model of human trunk development that undergoes morphogenetic movements, producing elongated structures with a notochord and ventral neural and mesodermal tissues. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying vertebrate notochord formation and establish a more comprehensive in vitro model of human trunk development. This paves the way for future studies of tissue patterning in a physiologically relevant environment.

 Focal gene amplifications are among the most common cancer-associated mutations1 but have proven challenging to engineer in primary cells and model organisms. Here we describe a general strategy to engineer large (more than 1 Mbp) focal amplifications mediated by extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs)2 in a spatiotemporally controlled manner in cells and in mice. By coupling ecDNA formation with expression of selectable markers, we track the dynamics of ecDNA-containing cells under physiological conditions and in the presence of specific selective pressures. We also apply this approach to generate mice harbouring Cre-inducible Myc- and Mdm2-containing ecDNAs analogous to those occurring in human cancers. We show that the engineered ecDNAs spontaneously accumulate in primary cells derived from these animals, promoting their proliferation, immortalization and transformation. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of Mdm2-containing ecDNAs to promote tumour formation in an autochthonous mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings offer insights into the role of ecDNA-mediated gene amplifications in tumorigenesis. We anticipate that this approach will be valuable for investigating further unresolved aspects of ecDNA biology and for developing new preclinical immunocompetent mouse models of human cancers harbouring specific focal gene amplifications.

 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow regions of intense water vapour transport in the Earth’s atmosphere. These transient phenomena carry water from the subtropics to the mid-latitudes and polar regions1,2, making up the majority of polewards moisture transport3–5 and exerting control on the precipitation and water resources in many regions6,7. In addition to transporting moisture, ARs also transport heat, but the impact of this transport on global near-surface air temperatures has not yet been characterized. Here we show that seasons with more frequent ARs also have warmer than average temperatures in many mid-latitude regions, and that AR events are associated with temperature anomalies of 5–10 °C above the climatological mean. This is due to anomalous horizontal transport and convergence of sensible heat and moisture in the lower atmosphere, which increases both downward sensible heat flux and downwelling long-wave radiation at the surface. On an hourly timescale, over 70% of extreme warm-temperature anomalies occur within ARs in large portions of the mid-latitudes, and ARs are associated with moist and compound heatwaves in many regions worldwide, suggesting that consideration of ARs may improve predictive capability for certain extreme heat events. Our results demonstrate that ARs significantly impact air temperatures on a wide array of timescales, and that they may play a wider role in global energy transport than previously recognized.

 Much of the human genome is transcribed into RNAs1, many of which contain structural elements that are important for their function. Such RNA molecules—including those that are structured and well-folded2—are conformationally heterogeneous and flexible, which is a prerequisite for function3,4, but this limits the applicability of methods such as NMR, crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy for structure elucidation. Moreover, owing to the lack of a large RNA structure database, and no clear correlation between sequence and structure, approaches such as AlphaFold5 for protein structure prediction do not apply to RNA. Therefore, determining the structures of heterogeneous RNAs remains an unmet challenge. Here we report holistic RNA structure determination method using atomic force microscopy, unsupervised machine learning and deep neural networks (HORNET), a novel method for determining three-dimensional topological structures of RNA using atomic force microscopy images of individual molecules in solution. Owing to the high signal-to-noise ratio of atomic force microscopy, this method is ideal for capturing structures of large RNA molecules in distinct conformations. In addition to six benchmark cases, we demonstrate the utility of HORNET by determining multiple heterogeneous structures of RNase P RNA and the HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) RNA.

 A central question in neuroscience is how synaptic plasticity shapes the feature selectivity of neurons in behaving animals1. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons display one of the most striking forms of feature selectivity by forming spatially and contextually selective receptive fields called place fields, which serve as a model for studying the synaptic basis of learning and memory. Various forms of synaptic plasticity have been proposed as cellular substrates for the emergence of place fields. However, despite decades of work, our understanding of how synaptic plasticity underlies place-field formation and memory encoding remains limited, largely due to a shortage of tools and technical challenges associated with the visualization of synaptic plasticity at the single-neuron resolution in awake behaving animals. To address this, we developed an all-optical approach to monitor the spatiotemporal tuning and synaptic weight changes of dendritic spines before and after the induction of a place field in single CA1 pyramidal neurons during spatial navigation. We identified a temporally asymmetric synaptic plasticity kernel resulting from bidirectional modifications of synaptic weights around the induction of a place field. Our work identified compartment-specific differences in the magnitude and temporal expression of synaptic plasticity between basal dendrites and oblique dendrites. Our results provide experimental evidence linking synaptic plasticity to the rapid emergence of spatial selectivity in hippocampal neurons, a critical prerequisite for episodic memory.

 The last giant impact on Earth is thought to have formed the Moon1. The timing of this event can be determined by dating the different rocks assumed to have crystallized from the lunar magma ocean (LMO). This has led to a wide range of estimates for the age of the Moon between 4.35 and 4.51 billion years ago (Ga), depending on whether ages for lunar whole-rock samples2–4 or individual zircon grains5–7 are used. Here we argue that the frequent occurrence of approximately 4.35-Ga ages among lunar rocks and a spike in zircon ages at about the same time8 is indicative of a remelting event driven by the Moon’s orbital evolution rather than the original crystallization of the LMO. We show that during passage through the Laplace plane transition9, the Moon experienced sufficient tidal heating and melting to reset the formation ages of most lunar samples, while retaining an earlier frozen-in shape10 and rare, earlier-formed zircons. This paradigm reconciles existing discrepancies in estimates for the crystallization time of the LMO, and permits formation of the Moon within a few tens of million years of Solar System formation, consistent with dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation11. Remelting of the Moon also explains the lower number of lunar impact basins than expected12,13, and allows metal from planetesimals accreted to the Moon after its formation to be removed to the lunar core, explaining the apparent deficit of such materials in the Moon compared with Earth14.

 Recent Antarctic sea-ice decline is a substantial source of concern, notably the record low in 2023 (ref. 1). Progress has been made towards establishing the causes of ice loss1–5 but uncertainty remains about its consequences for ocean–atmosphere interaction. Resolution of this uncertainty is important as ice decline can substantially alter surface heat loss and thus the ocean and atmosphere6. Here we show that the strongest winter 2023 ice-retraction regions provide an important new source of turbulent ocean heat loss to the atmosphere in wintertime. Ice concentration in these regions (located primarily in the Weddell, Bellingshausen and Ross seas) is reduced by up to 80% and is accompanied by an unprecedented doubling of mid-winter ocean heat loss. Also, there is a phase shift in the time of peak heat loss from late April to mid-June, with weaker than normal heat loss in austral autumn. The winter surface-heat-loss intensification is accompanied by substantial changes on both sides of the ocean–atmosphere interface. These include increases in atmospheric-storm frequency and surface-heat-loss-driven dense water formation, although the implications of the densification for broader processes such as Antarctic bottom water formation remain unclear. Our results reveal that the 2023 Antarctic sea-ice loss has substantially modified air–sea interaction in the Southern Ocean and motivate in-depth analysis of the wider climate-system impacts.

 The demand for the three-dimensional (3D) integration of electronic components is steadily increasing. Despite substantial processing challenges, the through-silicon-via (TSV) technique emerges as the only viable method for integrating single-crystalline device components in a 3D format1,2. Although monolithic 3D (M3D) integration schemes show promise3, the seamless connection of single-crystalline semiconductors without intervening wafers has yet to be demonstrated. This challenge arises from the inherent difficulty of growing single crystals on amorphous or polycrystalline surfaces after the back-end-of-the-line process at low temperatures to preserve the underlying circuitry. Consequently, a practical growth-based solution for M3D of single crystals remains unknown. Here we present a method for growing single-crystalline channel materials, specifically composed of transition metal dichalcogenides, on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces at temperatures low enough to preserve the underlying electronic components. Building on this developed technique, we demonstrate the seamless monolithic integration of vertical single-crystalline logic transistor arrays. This accomplishment leads to the development of unprecedented vertical complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) arrays composed of grown single-crystalline channels.

 Recent observations have found a large number of supermassive black holes already in place in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang, many of which seem to be overmassive relative to their host galaxy stellar mass when compared with local relation1–9. Several different models have been proposed to explain these findings, ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing bursts of high accretion rate10–16. Yet, current datasets are unable to differentiate between these various scenarios. Here we report the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad Hα emission in a galaxy at z = 6.68, which traces a black hole with a mass of about 4 × 108M⊙ and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The black hole to host galaxy stellar mass ratio is about 0.4—that is, about 1,000 times above the local relation—whereas the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely an indication of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionization.

Here the authors compare expression profiles between different human inflammatory skin diseases and identify gene modules such as cytokines or inflammatory mediators and a molecular map to assist in diagnosis and treatment. 
 Previous advances have identified immune pathways associated with inflammatory skin diseases, leading to the development of targeted therapies. However, there is a lack of molecular approaches that delineate these pathways at the individual patient level for personalized diagnostic and therapeutic guidance. Here, we conduct a cross-comparison of expression profiles from multiple inflammatory skin diseases to identify gene modules defining relevant immune pathways. Seven modules are identified, representing key immune pathways: Th17, Th2, Th1, Type I IFNs, neutrophilic, macrophagic, and eosinophilic. These modules allow the development of a molecular map with high diagnostic efficacy for inflammatory skin diseases and clinico-pathologically undetermined cases. Aligning dominant modules with treatment targets offers a rational framework for treatment selection, improving response rates in both treatment-naïve patients and non-responders to targeted therapies. Overall, our approach offers precision medicine for inflammatory skin diseases, utilizing transcriptional modules to support diagnosis and guide personalized treatment selection.

 Affinity chromatography is the method of choice for the rapid purification of proteins from cell extracts or culture supernatants. Here, we present the light-responsive Azo-tag, a short peptide comprising p-(phenylazo)-L-phenylalanine (Pap), whose side chain can be switched from its trans-ground state to the metastable cis-configuration by irradiation with mild UV light. Since only trans-Pap shows strong affinity to α-cyclodextrin (α-CD), a protein exhibiting the Azo-tag selectively binds to an α-CD chromatography matrix under daylight or in the dark but elutes quickly under physiological buffer flow when illuminating the column at 355 nm. We demonstrate the light-controlled single-step purification – termed Excitography – of diverse proteins, including enzymes and antibody fragments, without necessitating competing agents or harsh buffer conditions as normally applied. While affinity chromatography has so far been governed by chemical interactions, introducing control by electromagnetic radiation as a physical principle adds another dimension to this widely applied separation technique.

 Phase stability, and the limits thereof, are a central concern of materials thermodynamics. However, the temperature limits of equilibrium liquid stability in chemical systems have only been widely characterized under constant (typically atmospheric) pressure conditions, whereunder these limits are represented by the eutectic. At higher pressures, the eutectic will shift in both temperature and chemical composition, opening a wide thermodynamic parameter space over which the absolute limit of liquid stability, i.e., the limit under arbitrary values of the thermodynamic forces at play (here pressure and concentration), might exist. In this work, we use isochoric freezing and melting to measure this absolute limit for the first time in several binary aqueous brines, and nodding to the etymology of “eutectic”, we name it the “cenotectic” (from Greek “κοινός-τῆξῐς”, meaning “universal-melt”). We discuss the implications of our findings on ocean worlds within our solar system and cold ocean exoplanets; estimate thermodynamic limits on ice crust thickness and final ocean depth (of the cenotectic or “endgame” ocean) using measured cenotectic pressures; and finally provide a generalized thermodynamic perspective on (and definition for) this fundamental thermodynamic invariant point.

The authors here elucidate cryo-EM structures of CB1 bound to peripherally restricted inhibitors to explain these drugs’ molecular mechanism of action. 
 The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) regulates synaptic transmission in the central nervous system, but also has important roles in the peripheral organs controlling cellular metabolism. While earlier generations of brain penetrant CB1R antagonists advanced to the clinic for their effective treatment of obesity, such molecules were ultimately shown to exhibit negative effects on central reward pathways that thwarted their further therapeutic development. The peripherally restricted CB1R inverse agonists MRI-1867 and MRI-1891 represent a new generation of compounds that retain the metabolic benefits of CB1R inhibitors while sparing the negative psychiatric effects. To understand the mechanism of binding and inhibition of CB1R by peripherally restricted antagonists, we developed a nanobody/fusion protein strategy for high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination of the GPCR inactive state, and used this method to determine structures of CB1R bound to either MRI-1867 or MRI-1891. These structures reveal how these compounds retain high affinity and specificity for CB1R’s hydrophobic orthosteric site despite incorporating polar functionalities that lead to peripheral restriction. Further, the structure of the MRI-1891 complex along with accompanying molecular dynamics simulations shows how differential engagement with transmembrane helices and the proximal N-terminus can propagate through the receptor to contribute to biased inhibition of β-arrestin signaling. Peripherally restricted CB1 inhibitors retain the weight loss benefits of this drug class while sparing the negative psychiatric side effects.

However, the de novo design of protein hetero-oligomers with three or more distinct chains with nearly identical structures is a challenging unsolved problem because it requires the accurate design of multiple protein-protein interfaces simultaneously. Here, we describe a divide-and-conquer approach that breaks the multiple-interface design challenge into a set of more tractable symmetric single-interface redesign tasks, followed by structural recombination of the validated homo-oligomers into pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomers. Starting from de novo designed circular homo-oligomers composed of 9 or 24 tandemly repeated units, we redesigned the inter-subunit interfaces to generate 19 new homo-oligomers and structurally recombined them to make 24 new hetero-oligomers, including ABC heterotrimers, A2B2 heterotetramers, and A3B3 and A2B2C2 heterohexamers which assemble with high structural specificity. The symmetric homo-oligomers and pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomers generated for each system have identical or nearly identical backbones, and hence are ideal building blocks for generating and functionalizing larger symmetric and pseudosymmetric assemblies. Hetero-oligomeric proteins offer many advantages for bioengineering efforts but are difficult to make from scratch.

Here, the authors identify the key role of collagen signaling and ECM stiffness in regulating stem cell multipotency in glandular epithelia. 
 Glandular epithelia, including mammary gland (MG) and prostate, are composed of luminal and basal cells. During embryonic development, glandular epithelia arise from multipotent stem cells (SCs) that are replaced after birth by unipotent basal and unipotent luminal SCs. Different conditions, such as basal cell transplantation, luminal cell ablation, and oncogene expression can reinduce adult basal SC (BaSCs) multipotency in different glandular epithelia. The mechanisms regulating the reactivation of multipotency are incompletely understood. Here, we have found that Collagen I expression is commonly upregulated in BaSCs across the different multipotent conditions. Increasing collagen concentration or stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) promotes BaSC multipotency in MG and prostate organoids. Single cell RNA-seq of MG organoids in stiff conditions have uncovered the importance of β1 integrin/FAK/AP-1 axis in the regulation of BaSC multipotency. Altogether our study uncovers the key role of Collagen signaling and ECM stiffness in the regulation of multipotency in glandular epithelia.

 The three-runway system expansion project of the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) began with the land reclamation to the north of its original runway. To facilitate quick stabilization, the Deep Cement Mixing (DCM) in this project was featured as the novel reclamation method firstly applied in Hong Kong. Understanding ground deformation and underground consolidation is crucial for subsequent soil improvement, civil construction, and future planning at the new platform. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is used to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of land deformation following the completion of the third runway pavement. A combined strategy of persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) interferometry was implemented to address low radar coherence at the site. The new reclamation is subject to varying degrees of land subsidence, with a maximum monitored sinking rate to be ∼150 mm/year during September 2021 and October 2023. Whereas the 3rd runway was urgently transformed to operation, spatial details of consolidation status of this new land were not yet evaluated. We applied the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify the underlying sources leading to the measured deformation from InSAR. Three distinct sources have been unveiled, including an exponential decay signal (a quick compaction subsidence of surficial materials), a linear signal (a continuous subsiding from marine deposits) and a periodic signal (thermal effects correlated with buildings and bridges). Notably, the linear deformation component is mainly located in areas with prefabricated vertical drains (PVD), which is strongly correlating with the current monitored subsidence pattern. We incorporated the Terzaghi consolidation theory to further characterize InSAR displacement and estimate the subsidence decay property, consolidation time, ultimate primary settlement and consolidation degree at the 3rd runway, with unprecedented spatial details. Our results indicate the DCM method achieves geological stability more rapidly than the PVD method, with a time advantage of approximately 0.08–1.39 years. Meanwhile, DCM can effectively control the primary settlement to 29 % - 83 % of the PVD method. This research benefits our understanding of the consolidation process at the 3rd runway and offer reliable and detailed data of underground properties. This facilitates more accurate planning of follow-up reinforcement measures at specific locations if needed, which also serves as a valuable reference for future reclamation practices in Hong Kong, particularly using the DCM method."

 Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification based on deep learning has demonstrated promising performance. In general, using patch-wise samples helps to extract the spatial relationship between pixels and local contextual information. However, the presence of background or other category information in an image patch that is inconsistent with the central target category has a negative effect on classification. To solve this issue, a patch confidence-enhanced transformer (PCET) approach for HSI classification is proposed. To be specific, we design a patch quality assessment (PQA) branch model to evaluate the input patches during training process, which effectively filters out the intrusive non-central pixels. The output confidence of the branch model serves as a quantitative indicator of the contribution degree of the input patch to the overall training efficacy, which is subsequently weighted in the loss function, thereby endowing the model with the capability to dynamically adjust its learning focus based on the qualitative of the inputs. Second, a spectral–spatial multi-feature fusion (SSMF) module is devised to procure scores of representative information simultaneously and fully exploit the potential of multi-scale feature HSI data. Finally, to enhance feature discrimination, global context is efficiently modeled using the efficient additive attention transformer (EA2T) module, which streamlines the attention process and allows the model to learn efficient and robust global representations for accurate classification of the central pixel. A series of experimental results executed on real HSI datasets have substantiated that the proposed PCET can achieve outstanding performance, even when only 10 samples per category are used for training."

 Northern ecosystems, encompassing boreal forests, tundra, and permafrost areas, are increasingly affected by the amplified impacts of climate change. These ecosystems play a crucial role in determining the global carbon budget. To improve our understanding of carbon uptake in these regions, we evaluate the effectiveness of employing the physically-based Plant Phenology Index (PPI) to estimate gross primary productivity across ten different ecosystems. Based on eddy-covariance measurements from 65 sites, the vegetation index (VI)-driven GPP models (six different algorithms) are calibrated and validated. Our findings highlight that the Michaelis–Menten algorithm has the best performance and PPI is superior to the other five VIs, including NDVI, NIRv, EVI-2, NDPI, and NDGI, at predicting gross primary productivity (GPP) rates on a weekly scale (with an average R2 of 0.64 and RMSE of 1.70 g C m−2 d−1), regardless of short-term environmental constraints on photosynthesis. Through our scaled-up analysis, we estimate the annual GPP of the vast 37 million km2 study region to be around 22 Pg C yr−1, aligning with other recently developed products such as GOSIF-GPP, FluxSat-GPP, and FLUXCOM-X GPP. Derived from a climate-independent approach, the PPI-GPP product offers distinct advantages in exploring relationships between climate variables and terrestrial ecosystem productivity and phenology. Furthermore, this product holds significant value for assessing forestry and agricultural production in northern regions and for benchmarking terrestrial biosphere models and Earth system models."

 Glacial lakes (GLs), which serve as natural reservoirs, are also prospective sources of risk, and their risk levels are continuously increasing as a result of global climate warming. Nevertheless, GLs are situated in mountainous and valley regions, which are distinguished by their complex terrain and unpredictable weather conditions. This leads to restricted availability of optical imagery as a consequence of the frequent cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), however, encounters issues with geometric distortion. This paper introduces an unsupervised method based on geometric distortion detection (without orbit state information) and historical positioning using dual-orbit SAR imagery to research GL extraction effectively. This method detects low-quality pixels from dual-orbit SAR imagery through geometric distortion. It extracts GLs using a majority voting integration of unsupervised classification algorithms constrained by historical GL center points. The Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) was chosen as a representative region for the study, and experiments were conducted from July to August 2018 using dual-orbit Sentinel-1 imagery. A total of 600 refined samples were used for comparative verification. The results demonstrate that this method is capable of reliably identifying the active and passive geometric distortions in SAR imagery. The fusion of dual-orbit SAR based on geometric distortion can effectively enhance the classification performance of remote sensing imagery and achieve the acquisition of GL water storage area during the flood season. The geometric distortion rate was reduced from 29.9% to 7.9% after fusion correction, and the accuracy, recall rate, precision, Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1-Score were 0.989, 0.900, 0.908, 0.825, and 0.904, respectively.

 Cloud base height (CBH) is one of the most uncertain parameters in surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR) estimation. Climatology statistical models of cloud vertical structure (CVS), which provide 1-degree grid averages or latitude zone averages of CBH and cloud thickness (CT), have been frequently applied to improve coarse-resolution SDLR estimation. This study aims to develop a regional CVS climatology statistical model containing CT and CBH statistics at a kilometer scale, using CloudSat, CALIPSO, and MODIS data, and to explore its potential in kilometer-scale CBH and SDLR estimations. The RMSE of CBH estimated from the new CVS model ranges from 0.4 to 2.6 km for different cloud types when validated using CloudSat/CALIPSO data. CBH RMSEs are 2.20 km for Terra data and 1.99 km for Aqua data when validated against ground measurements. The simple Minnis CT model greatly overestimated CBH, while the new CVS model produced much better results. Using CBH from the new CVS model, the RMSEs of estimated cloudy SDLR are 26.8 W/m2 and 29.2 W/m2 for the Gupta-SDLR and Diak-SDLR models, respectively. These results are significantly better than those from the Minnis CT model and are comparable to those from the more advanced Yang-Cheng CT model. Moreover, the RMSEs of all-sky SDLR range from 22.6 to 21.5 W/m2 with resolution from 1 km to 20 km. These findings indicate that the regional CVS model is feasible for high-resolution CBH and SDLR estimation and can be effectively combined with other CBH estimation methods. This study provides a novel approach for estimating SDLR by integrating active and passive satellite data."

 The Canopy Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a pivotal factor in wildfire risk assessment within the fire triangle model, representing the ratio of canopy moisture content to its dry weight. Against the backdrop of degraded Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) performance and the underutilization of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in LFMC inversion, this study harnessed the coupled radiative transfer models (RTMs) to probe the spectral sensitivity of the VIIRS to LFMC and pinpoint the optimal band combination for LFMC inversion. To tackle the challenge of ill-posed inversion, we leveraged the correlation coefficient matrix to mitigate erroneous combinations of free parameters in the construction of the lookup table. Results showcase that VIIRS-based LFMC inversion yields marginally superior accuracy (R2= 0.57, R2= 0.32) for both grassland and forest types, with VIIRS-based inversion demonstrating a lower relative root mean square error (rRMSE = 5.84%), compared to results from the MODIS. By scrutinizing LFMC trends alongside precipitation (PP) data in four forest fires spanning from 2019 to 2022 in southwest China, varied degrees of LFMC decrease preceding fire outbreaks. Those results substantiated the validity of the proposed method for wildfire warning. Consequently, our study asserts the reliability of VIIRS in LFMC inversion, positioning it as a viable substitute and extension of MODIS. VIIRS offers continuous and effective product support for wildfire warning assessment, enhancing our ability to monitor and mitigate wildfire risks."

Shapley Additive Explanations analysis reveals past observed ozone as the most crucial feature, followed by water vapor mixing ratio and CMAQ ozone forecast. Temperature's impact varies seasonally, ranking first in winter and sixth in summer. Two calibrated uncertainty quantification methods, Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) and Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), are implemented. MCD performs better with a Spread-Skill Reliability of 0.23 ppb on test data. The calibrated MCD method effectively captures temporal uncertainty patterns across the 72-h forecast period, showing a high correlation (R = 0.89) between RMSE and standard deviation. Our bias-corrected air quality forecasts, with robust uncertainty quantification, can support applications demanding high-fidelity data, such as source identification, health assessments, and data assimilation, providing a reliable foundation for accurate modeling and decision-making."

 A deep atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) with a height of up to 4000–6000 m can develop over the Taklimakan Desert (TD). Nevertheless, the deep ABL in the TD was only studied for clean days. To date, the observational evidence concerning the interaction between the ultra-high ABL and dust aerosols over the TD remains scarce. In May 2022, we conducted the inaugural observational particle-sounding experiment in the TD, selecting representative cases of light and heavy dust days. The results captured a distinctive stratified structure of the daytime ABL induced by dust aerosols characterized by an ultra-thick residual layer (RL) in the afternoon. On heavy dust days, the daytime ABL was divided into convective boundary layer (CBL), capping inversion layer (CIL), RL and residual capping inversion layer (RCIL). Dust aerosols exerted a warming effect in the atmosphere reaching a maximum of about 1.0 K/day at the top of the dust aerosol layer and causing a temperature inversion. A CIL about 1000 m occurred between the CBL and the RL, which acted as a barrier, restraining CBL development and hindering dust aerosol transport. Furthermore, a deeper stable boundary layer on heavy dust days at night was observed. A unique vertical structure of nocturnal dust aerosol concentrations peaks of 477 μg/m3 was also observed in the deep RL at 1800–2600 m. The radiation effects of dust aerosols strengthened and weakened the stability of the RL above and below the dust layer, respectively. The study provided vertical observational evidence of the impact of dust aerosols on the deep ABL structure, thus contributing to a more profound comprehension of aerosol–radiation interactions over the desert arid region."

 The Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) represents a non-stationary time series characterized by distribution drift, posing a significant challenge to timely, effective, and accurate prediction. The Koopman operator theory provides a powerful mathematical tool for modeling nonlinear dynamic systems. It transforms nonlinear dynamic systems into linear dynamic systems, utilizing the linear Koopman operator to describe the evolution of system states. In this study, we propose an adaptation Koopman (Ada-Koopman) model based on the Koopman operator for predicting PM2.5 time series. The Ada-Koopman employs structural reparameterization and dynamic learning methods to effectively address the distribution drift problem arising from the non-stationarity of data. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline models, our model exhibits higher prediction accuracy in HPR, MPR and LPR of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. For the 24th hour, the Ada-Koopman model showed the most improvement in the accuracy of prediction in the high pollution regions with 39.82%, 17.44%, 15.95%, 5.80% and 14.21% improvement in RMSE compared to ARIMA, LSTM, DeepKoopman, KoopmanAE and KNF respectively. With segmented prediction and augmentation operators, Ada-Koopman alleviates the problem of error accumulation.

 A twenty-year (2004–2023) trend analysis of marine background air was conducted to explore potential changes in non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) emissions and atmospheric oxidation capacity using the Propylene Equivalent (Propy-Equiv) concentration. The focus was on C2-C6 NMHCs including alkanes, aromatics, acetylene, and isoprene, as those were most frequently found in the air samples. During wintertime, least impacted by photochemical impacts, a clear increase in n-pentane was observed from 2004 to 2023 (2.07 ± 2.26 % year−1) (statistically significant). Ethane (−3.82 ± 8.65 % year−1) and n-butane (−1.35 ± 15.62 % year−1) decreased from 2004 to 2008, but this was not statistically significant, but a statistically significant increase was then observed until 2023 (ethane: 1.05 ± 0.51 % year−1; n-butane: 1.09 ± 1.26 % year−1). Iso-pentane decreased (−4.25 ± 1.91 % year−1) steadily from 2004 to 2011 (statistically significant), then remained constant but with increased variability until 2023 (0.28 ± 2.49 % year−1). Propane increased (5.51 ± 23 1.35 % year−1) from 2004 to 2014 (statistically significant) and decreased thereafter until 2023 (−3.63 ± 3.91 % year−1). Acetylene (−1.67 ± 0.51 % year−1), benzene (−2.43 ± 0.14 % year−1), and i-butane (−0.58 ± 25 0.25 % year−1) showed a steady decreasing (statistically significant) trend from 2004 to 2023. The increasing ethane trend for the last 15 years is due to global oil and natural gas extraction, especially in the US, which began in mid-2009. Improvements in gasoline technologies are causing the decline of acetylene and benzene trends. The slower than expected decreasing trend of acetylene mixing ratio might have been offset by the impact of biomass burning emissions. Other NMHCs show varying trends indicating the merge of different emission sources and strengths in separate time periods. During the summertime, 80–90% Propy-Equiv concentration is due to isoprene, with a statistically significant increasing trend (0.45 ppbC/year) between 2004 and 2023. This increase is largely due to rising temperatures (1.58 ± 0.14 °C) leading to increased isoprene emissions (20 ± 1.6%)."

 The influence of microphysical processes on surface wind speeds is primarily indirect, primarily occurring through downdraft cooling and latent heat variations. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was adopted in this study to simulate a squall line that occurred in South China from May 6 to 7, 2023, during which the strongest observed surface wind reached 40.1 m s−1. This study analyzed the impact of microphysical processes on the strong surface winds of the squall line. The results showed that all four microphysics schemes—Thompson, Thompson aerosol-aware (Thompson-A), Morrison, and WSM6—could reproduce the strong winds of the squall line. The Thompson scheme was best suited for simulating the extremely high winds associated with the squall line process selected for this experiment. This scheme generated the strongest winds, largely owing to a concentrated precipitation area that produced strong negative buoyancy in localized regions. This effect was further intensified by high rates of rain evaporation and precipitation particle drag, which reduced downdraft interference and concentrated strong winds in specific areas. Additionally, the smaller raindrop sizes in both the Thompson and Thompson-A schemes enhanced evaporation, increased cooling, and strengthened downdrafts. However, the Thompson scheme achieved greater wind intensities than the Thompson-A scheme because of higher localized evaporation rates and a more focused precipitation distribution. In contrast, the Morrison and WSM6 schemes resulted in more dispersed cooling effects and weaker surface winds owing to broader evaporation areas and increased downdraft interference. However, in the Thompson-A scheme, the actual evaporation was somewhat weaker, likely influenced by the environmental temperature, which, along with the broader precipitation distribution, resulted in weaker surface winds than in the Thompson scheme. The Morrison scheme showed interference among downdrafts as they spread at the surface, leading to weaker surface winds. In the WSM6 scheme, a wider evaporation region and multiple negative buoyancy centers dispersed the effects of negative buoyancy because of broad precipitation and evaporation regions, further weakening the surface winds."

Previous studies have proposed numerous mechanisms by which acute metformin lowers blood glucose, including the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC). Here, we used transgenic mice that globally express theSaccharomyces cerevisiaeinternal alternative NADH dehydrogenase (NDI1) protein to determine whether the glucose-lowering effect of acute oral administration of metformin requires inhibition of mitochondrial complex I of the ETC in vivo. NDI1 is a yeast NADH dehydrogenase enzyme that complements the loss of mammalian mitochondrial complex I electron transport function and is insensitive to pharmacologic mitochondrial complex I inhibitors including metformin. We demonstrate that NDI1 expression attenuates metformin’s ability to lower blood glucose levels under standard chow and high-fat diet conditions.

Motor-related cortical areas, predominantly primary motor cortex (M1), encode subsequent afferent activities attributed to forelimb movement. M1 also encodes a subcomponent of muscle activity evoked by these afferent activities, corresponding to spinal reflexes. Furthermore, selective disruption of the afferent pathway specifically reduced this subcomponent of muscle activity, suggesting that M1 output drives muscle activity not only through direct descending pathways but also through the “transafferent” pathway composed of descending plus subsequent spinal reflex pathways.

We next aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which CIN dynamics control behavioral flexibility. We found that extinction learning enhances acetylcholine (ACh) release and that mimicking this enhancement through optogenetic induction of CIN burst firing accelerates the extinction process. In addition, we demonstrate that disrupting CIN pauses via continuous optogenetic stimulation reversibly impairs the updating of goal-directed behaviors. Overall, we demonstrate that CIN burst firing, which increases ACh release, promotes extinction learning, aiding the extinguishment of learned behaviors. Conversely, CIN firing pauses, which lead to ACh dips, are crucial for reversal learning, facilitating the adaptation of new actions.

10.1126/sciadv.adq4624,False,Science Advances,这篇论文研究了大肠杆菌中磷脂酰丝氨酸合酶 (PssA) 的膜结合机制和催化机制。PssA 是一种外周膜蛋白，参与细菌膜主要磷脂磷脂酰乙醇胺的生物合成。它以活性状态与细胞膜结合，或以非活性状态存在于细胞质中。PssA 催化胞苷二磷酸二酰甘油 (CDP-DG) 生成胞苷一磷酸和一个共价中间体，随后丝氨酸作用于该中间体生成磷脂酰丝氨酸。研究人员解析了两种 PssA 的晶体结构：一种与 CDP-DG 结合，另一种未结合。与CDP-DG结合的结构模拟了共价中间体形成前的米氏复合物，揭示了底物识别和催化的关键决定因素。此外，研究发现无膜结合的 PssA 处于单体-二聚体平衡状态，只有单体能够与膜结合，这表明磷脂生物合成可能受到酶寡聚状态的调控。这项研究的重点是酶的结构和功能，与大气环境遥感技术无关。,[],Eunju Lee;Gyuhyeok Cho;Jungwook Kim,Structural basis for membrane association and catalysis by phosphatidylserine synthase in Escherichia coli,"Phosphatidylserine synthase (PssA) is essential in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, a major phospholipid of bacterial membranes. A peripheral membrane protein PssA can associate with the cellular membrane in its active state or exist in the cytosol in an inactive form. The membrane-bound enzyme acts on cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DG) to form cytidine monophosphate and a covalent intermediate, which is subsequently targeted by serine to produce phosphatidylserine. Here, we present two crystal structures ofEscherichia coliPssA, one complexed with CDP-DG and the other without. The lipid-bound structure mimics the Michaelis complex before the formation of a covalent intermediate, revealing key determinants for substrate recognition and catalysis. Notably, membrane-free PssA is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, with only the monomer capable of associating with the membrane, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for phospholipid biosynthesis dependent on the oligomerization state of the enzyme."
10.1126/sciadv.ads6885,False,Science Advances,这篇论文研究的是一种新的合成方法，用于构建C(sp3)─C(sp3)键。具体来说，它描述了一种镍氢催化的自由基接力策略，结合氢原子转移（HAT）过程，实现了未活化烯烃与烷烃的加氢烷基化反应。该反应条件温和，具有广泛的官能团兼容性，并且可以通过催化剂控制实现区域选择性和对映选择性。这项研究的重点在于有机合成方法学，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Jiang-Ling Shi;Youcheng Wang;Yufeng Han;Jinqi Chen;Xiaolan Pu;Ying Xia,Hydroalkylation of unactivated olefins with C(sp3)─H compounds enabled by NiH-catalyzed radical relay,"The hydroalkylation reaction of olefins with alkanes is a highly desirable synthetic transformation toward the construction of C(sp3)─C(sp3) bonds. However, such transformation has proven to be challenging for unactivated olefins, particularly when the substrates lack directing groups or acidic C(sp3)─H bonds. Here, we address this challenge by merging NiH-catalyzed radical relay strategy with a HAT (hydrogen atom transfer) process. In this catalytic system, a nucleophilic alkyl radical is generated from a C(sp3)─H compound in the presence of a HAT promotor, which couples with an alkyl metallic intermediate generated from the olefin substrate with a NiH catalyst to form the C(sp3)─C(sp3) bond. Starting from easily available materials, the reaction not only demonstrates wide functional group compatibility but also provides hydroalkylation products with regiodivergence and excellent enantioselectivity through effective catalyst control under mild conditions."
10.1126/sciadv.adu7436,False,Science Advances,这篇论文的标题和摘要表明其研究重点是二甲双胍的作用机制。二甲双胍是一种降血糖药物，新证据表明它通过抑制线粒体复合物I发挥作用。这属于生物化学和药理学的研究范畴，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接联系。大气环境遥感技术主要关注地球大气层的组成、结构和动态，以及污染物在大气中的传播和影响。而本研究的主题是药物的作用机制，与大气环境无关。,[],Douglas R.
