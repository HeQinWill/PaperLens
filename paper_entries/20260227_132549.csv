These functions are increasingly threatened by soil degradation, especially in climate-vulnerable regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where unstable soils are prone to severe erosion. As soils continue to degrade, farmers face multiple challenges; they cannot afford accurate tests to assess soil, their livelihoods are constrained by demand for food, fuel and water, and competition for valuable resources hampers farming. Hence, there is a pressing need for accessible tools to assess soil health and methods to provide tailored advice on resilient, climate-smart agricultural management and optimal use of resources. This narrative review offers a comprehensive overview of key issues and potential solutions. We highlight tools and approaches that can support farmers to improve soil and secure livelihoods. Practical indicators and field-ready tests are evaluated, with examples from Ethiopia, but tailored to support farmers and advisors across sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries. A wide range of tests are reviewed, including physical, biological, chemical, function and service-related tests, drawing on scientific and farmers knowledge. Science-based tests require expertise, equipment and incur costs, while locally-derived tests are affordable and seamlessly applicable. We also review Nature-based Solutions for improving soil quality, and assess them against factors such as labour, costs, and crop production. There is no single universally applicable practice; suitability depends on farmers’ priorities and circumstances. Therefore, we explore predictive methods—mechanistic, process-based soil models, data- and knowledge-driven Artificial Intelligence and systems models—to simulate the impact of practices on soil and farm dynamics. Promising approaches include hybrid approaches assimilating data, physics and knowledge through digital soil mapping. Overall, this review emphasizes the need to empower farmers with accessible tools and methods to harness Nature-based Solutions, build climate resilience and secure sustainable futures for generations ahead."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae3dfb,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注能源技术（如光伏、风能、核能）的社会接受度，探讨了公众对能源技术与环境目标之间权衡和协同的认知，以及这种认知如何影响政策制定和公众态度。虽然涉及环境问题，但未直接涉及大气环境遥感技术、空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等具体技术领域。,[],Simon Montfort;Jonas Schmid;Jair Campfens;Isabelle Stadelmann-Steffen;Claudia R Binder,"Own trade-off and synergy beliefs, not others’, drive public acceptance of energy technologies","The decarbonization of energy systems can create both synergies and trade-offs with societal goals such as biodiversity conservation and landscape protection. Although existing research has focused on objective and physical trade-offs, the politics around energy technologies like Alpine photovoltaics (PVs), wind energy, and nuclear energy are not least shaped by how trade-offs are perceived by the people (first-order beliefs about trade-offs), including how respondents believe others in society view them (second-order beliefs about trade-offs). However, these remain insufficiently understood. Here, we conduct a population-representative survey experiment among 1,899 Swiss residents. We find that most participants perceive biodiversity conservation and landscape protection to be synergetic rather than a null-sum trade-off. Furthermore, most participants underestimate others’ preferences for emission reductions over landscape protection. Rural residents—who typically report lower trust in science and are more conservative—are more likely to expect that others favor landscape protection over emission reductions, even though 62% of Swiss residents prefer emission reductions. Strikingly, our survey experiment showing respondents information about the true societal preferences reveals that people are reluctant to revise their own preferences when seeing information about others’ trade-off preferences (social influence) or their acceptance of energy projects, like Alpine PV, wind parks, sustaining nuclear stations, and new nuclear power plants. Non-experimental results show that people’s own trade-off beliefs and perceptions of synergies with landscape protection and biodiversity conservation are more important for energy technology acceptance than second-order beliefs about how others in society view these trade-offs. Thus, people are unlikely to give way to peer pressure. This suggests that political debates may strategically emphasize trade-offs to advance particular agendas. Where renewable energy preferences are polarized, or political awareness is high, as in Switzerland, preferences may remain stable even when individuals learn that others hold different views."

ROS events remain a highly challenging hydrometeorological problem in several aspects of land surface model development, pushing the limits of land-atmosphere, snowpack, and runoff modeling. In particular, the representation of turbulent fluxes during these events is critical as energy into the snowpack controls the rate of melt and may impact the magnitude of resulting flooding. In this study, we investigate the representation of these turbulent fluxes in the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model coupled to the Noah-MP land model during a ROS event. For this case study, we use an extreme ROS event which occurred on 12–13 March 2019 across Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri, resulting in historic flooding and damages. Our WRF simulation of this event was compared with observations from AmeriFlux, snow products, and ERA5 reanalysis fields. While the simulation was able to produce the synoptic dynamics leading up to and during the event, there were notable discrepancies between the observed and modeled turbulent fluxes, suggesting that during ROS events, latent heat flux into the snowpack is underrepresented. Furthermore, analysis of the kilometer-scale WRF simulation run across the CONtiguous United States for 40 years at 4 km resolution (CONUS404) reveals the same underrepresented latent heat fluxes. Simple snowmelt and runoff models, forced with the observed fluxes as well as an experiment with reduced latent heat fluxes, shows that including the latent heat flux melts the snowpack quicker than without it, which has implications for the modeling of flooding in the region."

This study investigates whether daily exposure to wildfire-derived PM2.5 increases violent assaults in Seattle, Washington, between 2013 and 2023. Using ground-level wildfire smoke presence as an instrument for PM2.5 and crime report data from the Seattle Police Department, this study estimates a robust relationship between air pollution and urban violence. Over the study period, an average smoke-impacted day increased mean ambient PM2.5 by 7.0 μg m−3, which corresponds to 3.6% more assaults. The findings contribute to the emerging literature linking environmental change to social tensions and demonstrate that climate-driven pollution may increase violence even in relatively low-pollution, high-capacity urban settings like Seattle. The study establishes the first direct estimate of a causal effect of wildfire smoke on assaults, leveraging eleven years of daily data and high-resolution smoke exposure data. As wildfires become a globally relevant source of pollution under future climate scenarios, these results underscore the societal benefits of climate change mitigation."

Using remote sensing data, we present for the first time a comprehensive assessment of vegetation expansion across the ecologically fragile Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. During 2002–2023, vegetation expanded across nearly 1/5 of the barren land, with a change rate (–3.89 to −4.95 × 104 km2/10a) comparable in magnitude to the regional glacier retreat and permafrost thaw. The upper limit shifted upslope (∼35 m), while the lower limit shifted downslope (∼150 m). This bidirectional expansion mode is associated with the alleviation of water limitation at lower elevations (due to wetting) and energy limitation at higher elevations (due to warming). Nevertheless, projections suggest this rapid downslope expansion may decelerate. The identified bidirectional pattern challenges the prevailing assumption of a uniform upslope shift in alpine vegetation under climate change."

Here we use a frequently cited SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model to systematically assess the influence of climate extreme frequencies, defined by type intensity, duration, seasonality and co-occurrence of precipitation and temperature events, on the delivery of total nitrogen to river channels in the contiguous United States. Through multiple recalibrations of the model, we test the explanatory power of a wide range individual and combined mean and extreme climate predictors of total nitrogen flux at 425 US Geological Survey monitoring sites over a two-decade period. We use the Akaike information criterion for final optimized model selection. We find that hot/dry autumns, wet summers, and cool years enhance delivery, while dry summers and hot/wet autumns reduce delivery of total nitrogen. Using the final recalibrated model with temperature and precipitation inputs from three global circulation models, INM-CM4-8, GFDL-CM4, and CanESM5, under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 245 and 585, we compare the simulated impacts of changes in mean climate alone with changes in a combination of mean and extreme climate occurrence frequencies on total nitrogen flux from current levels to flux levels averaged over 2045–2054. We find that simulations accounting for the effects of extreme climate conditions differ significantly from those which consider only mean temperature (MT) and precipitation changes. Several regions, including some with significant agricultural activity, show a reversal in direction of simulated future total nitrogen flux, from reductions in flux due to a dominant effect of increased MT to an increase in flux due to an overriding effect of more frequent extreme events. These findings suggest that changing extreme climate regimes can substantially alter watershed nitrogen processing and underscore the need to account for them in the future."

When adequately thick and stable, river ice serves as a key transportation corridor for residents of remote Arctic and sub-Arctic communities. Climate change is altering the timing, extent, and duration of river ice cover, impacting both environmental processes and human activities. This study examines regional variability and temporal change in river ice phenology across Alaska using satellite observations and climate-driven modeling. We extracted reach-scale surface water extent from the Landsat archive to characterize river ice cover at sub-monthly time scales, capturing spatial heterogeneity and seasonal transitions during freeze-up and break-up. We then developed statistical models driven by ERA5-Land climate reanalysis to reconstruct annual metrics identifying the beginning, end, and duration of ice-covered conditions from water years 1979–2023. Model results show that typical river ice duration varied strongly along climatic gradients, ranging from 2.4 months in a southern coastal region to 7.3 months in northern Alaska (2000–2023). Decadal comparisons show that river ice duration during 2014–2023 was substantially shorter than in the 1980s across much of the state, with reductions exceeding three weeks within western and southwestern Alaska. These recent declines reflect the combined influence of delayed freeze-up and, to a lesser extent, earlier break-up onset. Long-term trend analyses (1979–2023) reveal persistent declines in ice duration, primarily driven by later freeze-up, with rates of change from 3–5 d decade−1 where trends are significant. Together, these findings demonstrate substantial, regionally structured changes in Alaska’s river ice regimes and underscore growing challenges in transportation, public safety, and access in river-dependent communities."

Source analysis indicated that ships contributed notably to organic aerosol and alkylated PAHs, and dominated ultrafine particles. These results support continued monitoring as the Mediterranean becomes a sulfur emission control area in 2025. 
 Maritime transport exerts a substantial influence on local air quality, particularly in port cities. Ship emissions are recognized as major contributors to air pollution, with comparable magnitude to those of road transport. This study, conducted in 2021 in Toulon, a port city on the French Mediterranean coast, assessed ship emissions one year after the implementation of IMO2020 sulfur regulations. Emission factors (EFs) were determined for key pollutants such as SO2, NOx, CO, NO, CH4 and particulate matter (PM), including black carbon (BC), organics (Org), sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as well as the particle number concentration (PN). The IMO2020 regulation led to a marked reduction in sulfur-related emissions, whereas pollutants such as BC, Org, and PAHs remained at pre-regulation levels. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis of PM1 organic aerosol (OA) measured by a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) was used to investigate shipping contribution to local air quality. PMF successfully distinguished between road and marine transport emissions, revealing a shipping contribution to the total OA of 11.2 %. Eight factors were resolved: three shipping-related OA, a Hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), a Cooking-like OA (COA), an Oxidized Hydrocarbon-like OA (OxHOA), a Less Oxidized OA (LOOA), and a More Oxidized OA (MOOA). Shipping and HOA factors were the dominant contributors to ultrafine particles, accounting together for 51.9 % of the alkylated PAHs (APAHs). These findings highlight the persistent influence of shipping emissions in port areas and demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced source apportionment methods to improve emission monitoring strategies, particularly as the Mediterranean region prepares for the implementation of Emission Control Area (ECA) regulations in 2025."

Harvey;Ashish Singh;Die Wang;Maria Zawadowicz;Chongai Kuang,Implications of Sea Breeze Circulations on boundary layer aerosols in the southern coastal Texas region,"Using TRacking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment field campaign observations and model simulations, we studied summertime sea-breeze events in southern Texas. When sea-breeze fronts moved inland, they mixed marine and continental air, changing aerosol concentrations by up to a factor of two as far as 50 km inland. The sea breeze also reduced the number of particles that can form cloud droplets, highlighting the connection between coastal meteorology and aerosol-cloud interactions. 
 The Sea Breeze Circulation (SBC) influences atmospheric processes at multiple scales in coastal regions. Understanding how SBCs impact the aerosol number budget and aerosol–cloud interaction processes is essential. This study investigates sea breeze–aerosol interactions (SAIs) during 46 summertime SBC events using data from the TRacking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER) field campaign across urban (main) and rural (supplemental) coastal sites in southern Texas. Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations complement observations to explore spatio-temporal meteorological controls on boundary layer aerosols. During the summertime, Sea Breeze Fronts (SBF) penetrating inland transported cool, moist air over the land, introducing air masses with distinct properties compared to the preexisting continental air. These SAIs cause variability in number concentrations of up to a factor of two, with events typically lasting ∼ 5 h before returning to background conditions. SAI impact on aerosols varies with site proximity to water and the preceding sea breeze (SB) history, primarily affecting the marine-influenced accumulation mode. The main site, influenced by both Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, reflects a stronger marine influence. In contrast, a supplemental site, at a similar shoreline distance but exposed only to the Gulf of Mexico and typically upstream of the urban core, samples SB air that has traversed land and partially regained continental characteristics. Simulations show that the regional SAIs extend ∼ 50 km inland and reach up to the boundary layer height. SAIs further decrease cloud condensation nuclei relevant aerosol number concentrations in ∼ 20 % of events during SBF passage."

We conducted field measurements in Hangzhou, China, to examine how the mass ratio (MR, coating-to-BC) affects light absorption enhancement (Eabs). Our results show that widely used optical models overestimate Eabs, especially under clean conditions. A new MR-dependent parameterization improves model accuracy and reduces this uncertainty. 
 Black carbon (BC) is a strong climate forcer, but considerable uncertainty remains in estimating its radiative impact, largely due to persistent gaps between observed and modeled light absorption enhancement (Eabs). In this study, we employed a Centrifugal Particle Mass Analyzer and Single Particle Soot Photometer tandem system to characterize mass ratio (MR, coating-to-BC) of BC-containing particles in Hangzhou, China. Observations across a field campaign revealed low, medium, and high Eabs values under varying atmospheric conditions. The uniform core-shell Mie model overestimated Eabs, particularly during clean periods (low Eabs). To address this, we developed an observationally constrained parameterization for transition-state particles based on MR-dependent optical transitions behaviors. This approach effectively reconciles modeled and measured Eabs across varying pollution conditions. It also emphasizes the importance of incorporating MR heterogeneity and transition-state optical behavior to improve BC light absorption estimates and reduce uncertainties in assessing radiative effects."

Distinct acetylene plumes at Linyuan (R² > 0.99) provided an internal consistency check. Results reveal spatial–seasonal source variability and highlight the roles of petroleum, mixed, and aged air sources in ozone formation management. 
 Ozone pollution remains a persistent challenge in Taiwan's Kaoping region due to dense industrial and urban emissions. Using high-resolution, hourly observations from three Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) combined with Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), this study resolved eight distinct sources of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), key precursors of ozone formation. The time-resolved PMF output captured source-specific temporal patterns – as shown by the acetylene factor at Linyuan (R2 = 0.99 with observations) – providing an intrinsic check on model performance and facilitating spatial interpretation of sources. Petroleum-related emissions dominate NMHC mass at all sites but are more prominent at Xiaogang, while aged air masses substantially enhance ozone pollution at downwind locations such as Linyuan and Chaozhou, underscoring the role of regional transport and atmospheric aging. Although mixed sources from vehicular and solvent emissions contributed less mass, they dominated ozone formation potential (OFP) due to higher chemical reactivity. Notably, their influence persisted even under moderate ozone conditions, indicative of a VOC-limited regime. Overall, these results emphasize that effective ozone mitigation in southern Taiwan requires coordinated control of petroleum, mobile, and solvent emissions, and demonstrate the value of multi-site, year-round, high-time-resolution NMHC measurements for constraining ozone precursors."

 Methane emissions from the oil and gas (O&G) industry play a major role in the global methane budget. The MethaneSAT space-based mission, which operated between March 2024 and June 2025, was designed to provide high-quality data on O&G methane emissions, from regional fluxes to high-emitting point sources. This was enabled by MethaneSAT's measurements in the 1598–1683 nm window with a high spectral resolution (0.25 nm), medium spatial sampling (100×400 m2 at nadir), and wide-area coverage (about 200 km at nadir). In this work, we showcase the potential of MethaneSAT to survey high-emitting point sources across O&G basins. We first assess MethaneSAT's performance for the detection, quantification and attribution of methane plumes through the analysis of key observation-related parameters, including wind speed, surface albedo and spatial sampling. We estimate a minimum detection limit of about 500 kg h−1 for a bright surface and low wind conditions, and an average detection limit around 1300 kg h−1 corresponding to an ensemble of sites with different observation conditions. We analyzed selected MethaneSAT datasets from the main O&G methane hotspots in the world. We observe particularly strong and persistent sources in the  Turkmenistan's South Caspian basin and in the Midland sub-basin of the US Permian Basin, and reveal major super-emissions in Maturin (Venezuela) and Zagros Foldbelt and Widyan (Iran), and the Appalachian basin. We also present other examples of strong methane sources at high latitudes (West Siberia), in offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, and from the waste sector. Our results illustrate the potential of MethaneSAT data to map methane emissions from hotspot regions and super-emitters around the planet."

We developed a high-resolution inventory of air pollutants and greenhouse gases for a heavily polluted Chinese province. This valuable resource reveals seasonal and spatial emission patterns across sources, cities, and hotspots, highlighting key differences among megacity clusters, industrial hubs, and agricultural regions. 
 A high-resolution inventory provides scientific basis for numerical simulations and control strategies. Under the background of synergistic carbon reduction and pollution control, constructing a carbon-pollutant co-emission inventory is of great significance for regional air quality improvement. Taken Henan Province in the Central Plains region as an example, the most polluted regions in China, an update emission inventory was developed. The study presents results showing that in 2022, the total emissions of SO2, NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, VOCs, NH3, BC, OC, CO2, CH4, and N2O in Central China, particularly Henan Province, were 408.7, 1336.2, 4647.3, 901.1, 440.0, 759.3, 672.7, 47.4, 90.3, 540462.0, 12462.0 and 42.9 kt respectively. The emissions were predominantly attributed to industrial combustion, electricity generation, motor vehicles, and agricultural activities. Significant spatial heterogeneity was observed. Northern heavy industrial cities exhibited high carbon and pollution intensities with carbon emission 1.75–3.7 times higher than the provincial average. In contrast, central transportation hubs were primarily characterized by elevated emissions of NOx and VOCs. Southern agricultural areas showed low carbon but high NH3 emissions. Temporally, emissions of SO2, CO, PM10 and PM2.5 peaked during winter, whereas NH3, CH4 and N2O increased during the summer agricultural season. High-emission grids were predominantly concentrated in urban agglomerations of the north-central region, especially around Zhengzhou, Jiaozuo, and Anyang. Co-hotspot analysis identified the central-northern industrial zone, especially around Zhengzhou, as the key region for coordinated control, with winter offering the most significant synergistic potential. This inventory provides a critical scientific basis for targeted, region-specific mitigation strategies."

Our measurements show good accordance with previous COS observations. Moreover, laboratory tests of ozone (O3) scrubbers proved squalene to remove O3 very efficiently without biasing the measurements of other trace gases. 
 Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is a low abundance atmospheric trace gas that has a tropospheric lifetime of 2–2.5 years, allowing it to reach the stratosphere, where it undergoes photolysis and reactions with ⋅OH and O⋅ radicals, generating precursors of stratospheric aerosols. Vertical profiling of COS has rarely been realised, especially for stratospheric observations. In this study, we introduce a new technique for continuous and discrete vertical profiling of COS based on the analysis of air samples collected by AirCore, the LIghtweight Stratospheric Air (LISA) sampler, and its scaled-up version BigLISA, in three campaigns in Trainou (2019), Kiruna (2021) and Sodankylä (2023) using a Quantum Cascade Laser Spectrometer (QCLS). To eliminate potential COS measurement biases, we have investigated the efficiency of different scrubbers based on cotton and squalene for removing ozone (O3) and assessed their potential impacts on COS measurement. Furthermore, we examined the influence of different inlet configurations and O3 scrubbers on the retrieved COS profiles, and found no significant impact within the uncertainties. We found that the differences with the averaged profiles obtained from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment – Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and the measured AirCore profiles and LISA samples were less than 10 % (±50 ppt) at both mid and polar latitudes. Differences between our observations and COS observations from the SPectromètre InfraRouge d'Absorption à Lasers Embarqués (SPIRALE) ranged from 10 % to 15 %, with both methods showing similar COS trends over altitude.

All isotopes exhibit strong seasonal cycles controlled by temperature, monsoon rainfall, and moisture source humidity. d-excess reflects source-region evaporation, while Δ′¹⁷O shows reduced seasonal sensitivity and highlights atmospheric mixing and transport processes, providing new constraints on East Asian hydroclimate dynamics. 
 Precipitation stable isotopes are critical tracers for understanding climate variability and the hydrological cycle, as they enable the tracing of moisture sources, air mass mixing, and evaporation vs. condensation mechanisms. In mid-latitude regions such as South Korea, which are influenced by tropical and extratropical circulation, long-term isotope records remain scarce. Here, we analyze stable isotopes in precipitation collected bi-weekly in Seoul, South Korea, from 2016 to 2020. The oxygen isotope composition (δ18O) ranged widely from 1.15 ‰ to −18.21 ‰, hydrogen isotope composition (δ2H) varied from 3.3 ‰ to −132.0 ‰, the deuterium excess (d-excess) ranged from 23.7 ‰–2.1 ‰ and the 17O-excess (Δ′17O) ranged from 69 to −28 per meg. All three primary isotopes exhibited a coherent sinusoidal seasonal cycle, with the most depleted values in winter, gradual enrichment through spring, and sharp depletion during the summer monsoon, reflecting the combined influence of temperature and the amount effect. The d-excess was highest during cold, dry months and lowest in humid, rainy months, reflecting shifts in near-surface relative humidity at the moisture source region and associated kinetic fractionation. Meanwhile, Δ′17O exhibited a similar season trend with a smaller amplitude, indicating a reduced sensitivity to seasonal variations in relative humidity compared to d-excess and suggesting additional modulation by large-scale transport and water vapor mixing. The local meteoric water line closely matches the global line but winter samples show a higher intercept and a slightly steeper δ17O–δ18O slope, suggesting enhanced kinetic fractionation under continental air masses. A consistently negative δ18O–Δ′17O relationship was observed except in winter when it weakened. This integrated analysis of δ18O, d-excess, and Δ′17O provides a comprehensive picture of source humidity, transport dynamics, and seasonal precipitation processed in a mid-latitude East Asia, and offers a valuable reference for refining isotope-enabled climate models over East Asia.

We created the first long-term record of these glaciers and their lakes from 1990 to 2022 by analyzing satellite images. Our results show that many glaciers are shrinking while their lakes are growing. These changes matter because they affect water supply, flood risks, and mountain landscapes. This dataset offers new knowledge to support research and planning for climate change impacts. 
 Lake-terminating glaciers (LTGs) typically exhibit higher rates of retreat and thinning compared to land-terminating glaciers. However, a comprehensive inventory for LTGs and their associated proglacial lakes across High Mountain Asia (HMA) is currently lacking, limiting further understanding of their spatial heterogeneity in glacier change. This study employs a semi-automated identification method, coupled with rigorous visual inspection, to construct a comprehensive inventory of LTGs and proglacial lakes in HMA for 1990 and 2022. Our data indicate that, by 2022, HMA hosted 1740 LTGs (5082.08 ± 13.15 km2), among which 667 glaciers (3454.59 ± 12.43 km2) remained in contact with proglacial lakes since 1990, 1073 (1627.49 ± 4.30 km2) are newly developed and 468 (960.13 ± 3.18 km2) had disconnected from proglacial lakes during the investigation period. Accordingly, 645 proglacial lakes (207.18 ± 0.82 km2) remained in contact with ice, 1123 new lakes (54.85 ± 0.35 km2) formed, and 485 lakes (45.31 ± 0.34 km2) detached from ice (including 25 disappeared). During the past 32 years, the total area of proglacial lakes increased by 138.19 ± 1.18 km2 (81.7 %), alongside a glacier area loss of 324.43 ± 19.23 km2 (5.1 %). The southern regions of HMA, particularly the Hindu Kush, Himalayas, Nyainqentanglha, and Gangdise Mountains, exhibited the highest concentration and most rapid changes of the glacier-lake system.

We aim to highlight the challenges and opportunities in advancing our understanding of regional ocean variability and allow to understand the reasons behind the notable scarcity of such records and explore how we can improve mechanisms to prevent misinterpretation and ensure that these efforts effectively support future research. About 24 records indicated that SST anomalies fluctuated throughout the entire Common Era, with values between (-5.84 to 0.62). The limited availability of high-resolution SST records constrains our ability to fully grasp regional climate dynamics and their broader implications for the global climate system. To address this, it is essential to prioritize acquiring records that minimize coastal influences, thereby providing clearer insights into large-scale oceanic and climatic patterns. Enhancing the representation of currently under-sampled regions is crucial for constructing a more comprehensive picture of Earth’s climate history. However, addressing these gaps involves more than data collection alone. It requires a concerted effort to produce and disseminate SST reconstructions spanning the Common Era, while also raising awareness of their value to the scientific community. Ultimately, such initiatives will enhance our ability to anticipate and respond to future climate change, equipping policymakers and communities with the knowledge necessary to build resilience and adapt to an increasingly dynamic climate system."

Global trends are robust across methodological configurations. Most of the spread comes from the choice of temperature dataset, while other methodological impacts remain small. Our results show that both research and operational indicators consistently track global ocean warming, supporting their reliability and traceability for climate monitoring and Earth energy budget assessments. 
 The Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI), defined as the difference between the incoming solar radiation and the outgoing terrestrial radiation at the top of the atmosphere, provides a fundamental measure of anthropogenic climate change. Today, this imbalance is positive, indicating that the Earth system is accumulating heat, of which more than 90 % is stored in the ocean. The evolution of Global Ocean Heat Content (GOHC) thus constitutes a critical indicator of planetary warming and underpins the Earth Heat Inventory, currently the only approach capable of quantifying the observed absolute value of the EEI. Yet, the lack of standardized calculation protocols and the diversity of methodological choices across studies hinder the comparability of GOHC estimates and obscure the traceability of associated uncertainties. Here, we present a comprehensive, transparent assessment of GOHC trends and uncertainties based on an ensemble of 13 gridded in situ ocean temperature products spanning 1960–2024. Building on prior community efforts, we systematically evaluate the sensitivity of GOHC trends to key methodological choices, including (i) the temperature product, (ii) the definition of the temperature variable, (iii) the treatment of seawater density and heat capacity, (iv) the ocean domain used for integration, and (v) the method used for trend estimation. Our results demonstrate that GOHC trends are remarkably robust across methodological configurations. Variations associated with the temperature variable definition, thermodynamic parameters, ocean domain, or trend estimation method remain below 0.1 W m⁻², well within the ensemble-mean uncertainty range of 0.21 W m⁻², across both recent decades and multi-decadal timescales. We further show that the substantial spread among published EEI estimates reflects pronounced temporal variability in ocean heat uptake rates. This variability renders EEI estimates highly sensitive to the selected averaging period, underscoring that present-day absolute EEI values can only be meaningfully interpreted in a long-term context. We demonstrate that the ensemble spread provides a practical and comprehensive proxy for GOHC uncertainty, consistent with product-specific uncertainty estimates. By consolidating international assessment practices, this study delivers a transparent characterization of the state of ocean warming and provides a fully documented, openly available framework for constructing a GOHC indicator. Together, these advances strengthen the Earth Heat Inventory estimate, establish a reliable benchmark for monitoring ocean warming and EEI, facilitate intercomparison across studies, and reinforce international climate assessments at the science and policy interface."

Data gaps caused by clouds and other non-optimal conditions limit comprehensive analyses like trend monitoring. This study evaluated DINCAE and DINEOF gap-filling methods for reconstructing chlorophyll a datasets, including total chlorophyll a and five major phytoplankton groups. Both methods showed robust reconstruction capabilities, aiding pattern detection and long-term ocean colour analysis. 
 Phytoplankton are vital to marine biogeochemical cycles and form the base of the marine food web. Comprehensive datasets offering a spatiotemporal perspective on phytoplankton composition are essential for assessing the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. Phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) classify phytoplankton based on their biogeochemical functions, enabling assessments of nutrient cycling, primary productivity, and ecosystem structure. However, satellite-derived ocean colour products like PFTs chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations are challenged by limited temporal and spatial coverage due to the exclusion of data collected under non-optimal observing conditions, such as strong sun glint, clouds, thick aerosols, straylight, and large viewing angles or due to the specific sensor configuration and sensor malfunction. This highlights the importance of gap-filling techniques for producing consistent datasets, which are currently missing for operational data sets. This study evaluates two robust gap-filling methods for satellite observations: Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) and Data Interpolating Convolutional Auto Encoder (DINCAE). These methods were applied to Sentinel 3A/B OLCI-derived Chl a concentration products in several regions of the Atlantic Ocean over three years of data, including total Chl a (TChl a) and Chl a concentration of five major PFTs, namely diatoms, dinoflagellates, haptophytes, green algae, and prokaryotic phytoplankton. The reconstructed datasets were assessed using test dataset evaluation and validated with in situ measurements collected during the transatlantic RV Polarstern expedition PS113 in 2018. The test dataset evaluation indicates that DINCAE performs slightly better than DINEOF in representing transient-scale variability, particularly within highly dynamic regions. DINCAE achieves an average root-mean-square-logarithmic-error (RMSLE) in cross-validation that is 66 % lower for TChl a and 16 % lower for PFTs compared to DINEOF. However, external validation using in situ measurements indicates better performance for DINEOF than DINCAE, with improved regression metrics for PFTs, including a 12.5 % better slope, 13.6 % better intercept, and 68 % higher coefficient of determination (R2). The gap-filled datasets exhibit slightly reduced but still robust accuracy compared to the original satellite data while preserving statistical trends, improving spatial structure restoration, and increasing matchup data for validation. It is concluded that DINCAE and DINEOF each have unique strengths for gap-filling ocean colour products. DINCAE performs well in complex water bodies, effectively reproducing patterns from the original satellite product. In contrast, DINEOF shows higher overall reliability, supported by independent validation, and is better suited for larger areas due to its lower computational demands."

Fridlind;Israel Silber;Nicole Riemer;Daniel A. Knopf,Prognostic simulations of mixed-phase clouds with model AC-1D v1.0: the impact of aerosol types and freezing parameterizations on ice crystal budgets,"The role of Arctic clouds in the regional climate remains uncertain due to insufficient understanding of the amount of liquid droplets and ice crystals present in these clouds. An aerosol-cloud model is employed to examine the role of different aerosol types and freezing parameterizations on the number of ice crystals. The choice of freezing parameterization significantly changes the number of ice crystals impacting the interpretation of the evolution and warming effect of Arctic clouds. 
 Mixed-phase clouds at high latitudes contribute to the uncertainty in predicting cloud feedbacks and climate sensitivity, mainly due to the complexity of microphysical processes that influence the partitioning between the supercooled liquid and ice phases, and hence, cloud radiative effects on regional scales. Particularly in Arctic mixed-phase clouds, the activation of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) from various aerosol populations remains a leading source of uncertainty.  We developed an aerosol-cloud one-dimensional (AC-1D) model, which provides a novel framework to prognostically treat INP and ice crystal budgets while explicitly accounting for polydisperse and multicomponent aerosol that activate INPs following different freezing parameterizations. The AC-1D model is informed by large-eddy simulations to probe the impact of INP representation on predicted ice crystal number concentrations (Ni) and ice crystal budgets in mixed-phase Arctic stratus. We apply three immersion freezing (IMF) parameterizations, two time-independent (singular) and one time-dependent (classical nucleation theory), to predict the evolution of the INP reservoir and resulting ice crystal budget from polydisperse mineral dust, organic (humic-like substances), and sea spray aerosol particle size distributions. Our analysis focuses on how variations in aerosol number concentration and cloud system parameters such as cloud cooling rate, cloud-top entrainment rate, and ice crystal fall speed influence the INP reservoir and ice crystal budgets. Furthermore, this study investigates the competitive ice nucleation dynamics in mixed aerosol environments and provides a process-level quantification of the INP budget terms, which directly controls ice crystal budgets. For all studied case scenarios, the aerosol types and associated particle size distributions significantly impact INP and Ni, and the choice between a time-dependent and a singular freezing description yields orders-of-magnitude differences in the predicted INP and Ni over the 10 h simulation time, reflecting typical cloud lifetimes. Our results show that the influence of cloud cooling, INP entrainment, and sedimentation varies significantly depending on the chosen freezing parameterization. These findings underscore the critical need for robust IMF parameterizations and precise cloud system observations to enhance the accuracy of models in predicting mixed-phase cloud structure and evolution."

However, the dominant Cd species released in this process remain incompletely understood, particularly under different pH conditions. Herein, we investigated dynamic Cd speciation during the anaerobic reduction of Cd-bearing birnessite by Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA), revealing a progressive dominance of colloidal Cd throughout the experiment. This trend was amplified at higher pH, as evidenced by its ultimate contributions of 36.6%, 57.8%, and 77.1% to total dissolved Cd at pH 4.5, 6.0, and 8.0, respectively. Moreover, two distinct colloidal Cd fractions were identified by asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The first fraction (1 kDa to 50 nm) carried 27.7–45.6% dissolved Cd via complexation with SRFA derivatives, exhibiting a lower oxidation state, higher susceptibility to reoxidation, and increased Cd release risk. The second fraction (200–450 nm) carried 8.9–31.6% dissolved Cd and evolved from organic aggregates into MnOx-OM colloids. These composite colloids could enhance colloidal Cd stability and potential mobility, especially under pH 6.0 and 8.0, due to stable crystalline manganite/hausmannite formation and enriched oxidized OM. We highlight that the released colloidal Cd during MnOx reductive dissolution under varying pH could exhibit variable mobility, reactivity, and environmental risk."

By manipulating the concentration of gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) surrounding sessile saliva droplets, we altered their chemistry and then assessed the impacts of these changes on the infectivity of influenza A virus at relative humidities of 30, 50, and 80%. For virus exposed to low CO2 (<0.005% CO2 in N2) vs high CO2 (4.3–5% CO2 in N2), differences in inactivation were small except at 80% RH, where the virus decayed less (i.e., maintained greater infectivity) in low CO2 than in high CO2. The difference exceeded 1log10 at 2 h. For comparison, virus inactivation in ambient air (0.04% CO2) varied across conditions, sometimes exceeding and sometimes falling below that observed under high- and low-CO2 atmospheres. Collectively, these results suggest that the driving factors for virus inactivation vary with RH. We measured droplet pH using gold nanoprobes in combination with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and found that pH increased in low CO2 and decreased in high CO2 at 80% RH by ∼1 pH unit in both cases. Results were consistent with chemical equilibrium modeling, which indicated that both carbonate and phosphate buffering were important. Changes in pH were smaller or insignificant at 30 and 55% RH. At these low and medium RHs, rapid evaporation of water from the droplets and the resulting increase in viscosity may limit changes in pH. Measured changes in pH did not appear to be sufficient to drive virus inactivation under any tested condition. This finding suggests that pH likely does not impact influenza transmission by fomites."

However, their performance in complex flue gases containing NOx, aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs, e.g., toluene), and chlorinated VOCs (e.g., chlorobenzene) remains limited. This study evaluates the crystalline phase-dependence of TiO2-supported V2O5 catalysts (anatase: V/TiO2-A; rutile: V/TiO2-R) for synergistic multipollutant control. We identify a crystal-dependent reversal in synergistic catalytic performance: V/TiO2-A exhibits superior activity for NOx-toluene coremoval, while V/TiO2-R achieves optimal NOx-chlorobenzene elimination. Mechanistic studies reveal that oxygen vacancies in V/TiO2-A enhance toluene activation, whereas high V5+/V4+ ratios and Brønsted acidity in V/TiO2-R promote chlorobenzene activation and HCl formation. This insight enabled the design of a tandem catalyst system (V/TiO2-R upstream + V/TiO2-A downstream) within a single SCR reactor, achieving >90% simultaneous conversion of NOx, chlorobenzene, and toluene at 375 °C─outperforming individual catalysts, physical mixtures, and commercial benchmarks with high HCl selectivity. The configuration exploits phase-specific strengths─rutile for chlorinated VOC oxidation at high temperatures, followed by anatase for aromatic VOC degradation─avoiding separate control units and easing retrofit cost and space constraints."

Herein, we establish a metal-free catalytic framework for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) by synergistically integrating vacancy-defect engineering with a mild electrothermal coupling strategy (<100 °C). The defective carbon nanotubes (d-CNTs) create localized electron-rich pockets that optimize the adsorption of NOx intermediates and facilitate proton-coupled electron transfer. Under electrothermal coupling at 50 °C, the d-CNTs achieve a Faradaic efficiency of 64.4% and an NH3 yield rate of 2.54 mg h–1 cm–2 at a nitrate concentration of 10 mM. A combination of in situ spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations unravels a dual-channel acceleration mechanism: defect-induced electronic redistribution enhances NO3– activation, while thermally promoted atomic hydrogen (H*) mediates the sequential hydrogenation steps. This synergy not only suppresses the competing hydrogen evolution but also enables remarkable stability over 20 cycles in simulated wastewater. Beyond the laboratory performance, we demonstrate a practical product recovery route via gas stripping and acid absorption, and a comparative life-cycle assessment confirms a >90% reduction in carbon footprint relative to conventional industrial routes. The significance of this work lies in the conceptual integration of defect engineering and electrothermal operation within a metal-free NO3RR system, offering a generalizable strategy for low-carbon nitrate remediation and nitrogen valorization."

While photolysis dominates the degradation of neonicotinoids in atmospheric liquid water, existing studies focus primarily on bulk-solution reactions, overlooking the ubiquitous atmospheric microdroplets. Here, we employed in situ single-droplet ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, revealing that the photolysis rate of neonicotinoids in microdroplets was 25–76 times faster than in bulk solution. A comprehensive characterization of photoproduced reactive intermediates demonstrated that direct photolysis proceeded through denitrification pathways. Mechanistic investigation showed that interfacial enrichment combined with an ultrahigh electric field promotes photolysis, as evidenced by in situ FTIR, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. Free energy barriers for excited-state generation decreased linearly with increasing electric field strength at a rate of 104–105 kJ mol–1 au–1. Moreover, we established quantitative structure–activity relationship models to predict photolysis rate constants of neonicotinoids.

This study investigated the effects of sucralose (SUC) and UV-aged poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) MPs using an in vivo model of Caenorhabditis elegans. Exposure to SUC and/or MPs (1–100 μg/L) induced significant obesity phenotypes, including increased body width and volume alongside elevated lipid accumulation and lipid droplet levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Critically, coexposure produced stronger obesogenic effects than predicted additive values from single exposures, demonstrating a synergistic interaction. Behavioral analyses revealed that coexposure concurrently increased pharyngeal pumping rates but decreased crawling locomotion, with obesogenic parameters positively correlating with feeding activity and negatively with locomotor capacity. Molecular analysis confirmed the corresponding dysregulation of genes governing feeding behavior (mgl-1), energy sensing (aak-2), and lipid metabolism (daf-16, sbp-1), supporting the hyperphagia-hypolocomotion phenotype. Metabolomics analysis demonstrated exposure-specific disruption of nicotinate/nicotinamide metabolism and glutamate-mediated biosynthesis pathways, which collectively accelerated lipid accumulation. These results suggest that MPs can act not merely as obesogens but also synergistically amplify SUC’s obesogenic toxicity associated with altered locomotion and metabolism. Our findings highlight the necessity to incorporate cocontaminant interaction assessments into microplastic risk frameworks for addressing underestimated environmental health threats."

A common belief is that the sorption of hydrophobic EDCs is key to their rejection, while high sorption often leads to low rejection. However, this study reported distinct sorption–rejection behavior of EDCs by various chlorinated polyamide membranes. Specifically, the chlorinated NF90 membrane exhibited significantly reduced sorption and, thus, enhanced rejection for EDCs. This is primarily attributed to the enhanced hydrophilic carboxyl groups through chlorination-induced hydrolysis, which can suppress the hydrophobic interactions between the membrane and the EDCs. More interestingly, the chlorinated VNF1 membrane demonstrated higher sorption but also higher rejection of EDCs than that of the virgin membrane. The high sorption can be attributed to the strong hydrophobic interaction between EDCs and the hydrophobic chlorine attached to the membrane. Meanwhile, the large size of chlorine also strengthened membrane size exclusion, thereby enhancing its rejection of EDCs. Such enhanced size exclusion overperformed the impact of increased sorption, thus leading to enhanced rejection. These findings elaborate the existing membrane sorption–rejection framework and offer valuable insights for the rational design of advanced NF membranes aiming for the effective elimination of EDCs in water and wastewater treatment."

We investigated how projected increases in mean summer surface water temperature alter per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) toxicokinetics and their effects on the physiological performance of sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus). Adult fish were chronically exposed to an environmentally relevant PFAS mixture (perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) + perfluorooctanoate (PFOA)) under current and projected mean-temperature scenarios. Tissue PFAS concentrations, whole-organism metabolic rates, swimming performance, reproductive output, and somatic indices were assessed. Temperature modified PFAS tissue concentrations in a compound- and tissue-specific manner, notably promoting PFOA redistribution to eggs. Metabolic responses were temperature-dependent: at 26 °C, higher tissue PFAS concentrations were associated with elevated standard and maximum metabolic rates (SMR and MMR), maintaining aerobic scope (AS). At 28.5 °C, SMR remained stable while MMR and AS declined with rising PFAS, indicating less oxygen for energetically demanding activities. Despite unchanged performance outcomes for swimming and reproduction,  increase in hepatosomatic index with increasing tissue PFAS concentrations and altered PFAS distribution suggests detoxification costs. These findings indicate that increases in mean water temperature are likely to exacerbate contaminant stress, with consequences for coastal fish population resilience and offspring development. PFAS risk assessment should consider costressors under projected warming."

This study introduces an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework using a curated A549 cytotoxicity data set (19,841 compounds) that integrates customized Molecular Access System (MACCS) fingerprints, six base models, and a stacking ensemble meta-model, all optimized with a biobjective strategy to assess the toxicity of organic compounds in PM2.5. The stacking ensemble model demonstrated satisfactory performance (test AUC > 0.8), exhibiting good generalization, adaptability, and robustness. Nontargeted analysis generated and experimentally validated a prediction set from the Hong Kong PM2.5 samples (51 of 387 compounds confirmed from 13 classes), demonstrating broad applicability on an independent Nanjing PM2.5 set (572 compounds). Key substructures driving toxicity, identified through a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and cell experimental validation, revealed that PM2.5 compounds with aromatic rings and nitrogen-based functional groups (e.g., aromatic α,β-unsaturated ketones, aromatic amines, aromatic nitro compounds, and tertiary amines) likely contribute to high toxicity. The derived “structure–toxicity” rules narrow the search space from thousands of compounds to those containing critical substructures, enabling efficient prioritization of toxic components and providing a foundation for improving model specificity and predictive accuracy in future studies."

Also, over the past two decades, the progressive implementation of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) fuel sulfur content (FSC) regulations has driven major shifts in both fuel characteristics and compliance technologies. The widespread adoption of desulfurized marine fuels has markedly decreased average V/Ni ratios in coastal environments (to ∼1), whereas the continued use of heavy fuel oil (HFO) with exhaust gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) appears to maintain pre-IMO values. Compiling two decades of V/Ni data from ship emission studies, this work assesses temporal and technological trends to evaluate the robustness of this ratio as a diagnostic marker. The results show a global decrease in V/Ni ratios driven by fuel desulfurization with residual variability reflecting fuel type, sampling context, and industrial influence. Overall, the V/Ni ratio is a relevant tracer of shipping emissions in coastal areas and a potential indicator of scrubber operation in an evolving regulatory landscape."

By systematically replacing mineral salt medium components, we demonstrate that a modified HEPES/Cl–-rich medium allows colorimetric F– quantification (20–200 μM) during biodefluorination of 1-fluorodecane (FD), 4,5,5-trifluoropent-4-enoic acid (TFEA), and 4,4,4-trifluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl) crotonic acid (SFCA). Applied in a deep 96-well microtiter plate format, this approach explored the biodefluorination of these compounds in growing axenic cultures, resting cell incubations, and mixed environmental cultures. Sphingopyxis sp. strain NJF-3 and Rhodococcus sp. strain NJF-7 exhibited differential defluorination of TFEA and SFCA. Resting cells exhibited limited defluorination activity to TFEA and SFCA, but strain NJF-7 displayed higher TFEA defluorination (219 μM F–) than strain NJF-3 (39.1 μM F–), indicating a greater growth-independent defluorination capacity. Defluorination by environmentally sourced microbial communities varied, potentially reflecting differences in sample origin (water vs soil). Correlation analysis of intermediates measured in different SFCA-defluorinating cultures indicated that abiotic and biotic reactions contribute to SFCA transformation, with a β-oxidation-type pathway inferred for the biotransformation. The refined approach expands the tool box for investigating biodefluorination in microbial enrichment and pure culture studies."

Here, we investigated emissions from a pan, an air fryer, and an oven under controlled residential conditions with constant chicken quantity and varying oil quantity and marination. The pan generated the highest PM2.5 concentrations and mass-based emission rates, whereas the air fryer emitted moderate levels and the oven had minimal emissions. Variations in PM2.5 mass concentration are tightly associated with the size distribution of emitted particles, with diameter (dp) peaking at 120–140 nm, 55–62 nm, and 20–30 nm from the pan, air fryer, and oven, respectively. Oil quantity and marination substantially affected mass-based emissions, whereas number concentrations were not substantially influenced. Organic compounds dominated the aerosols, and spectral marker ratios (f55/f57, f67/f69) clearly differentiated them from ambient aerosols. Based on the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) model with particle hygroscopic growth, the air fryer produced the highest particle number dose, while pan frying generated the largest mass and surface area dose, with over 50% depositing in the alveolar region. These findings demonstrate that cooking method is a critical determinant of indoor particle exposure and that different cooking methods present distinct exposure profiles depending on the metric considered."

However, the scientific evidence remains limited, particularly in studies on clinically diagnosed precocious puberty (PP), and the specific pollutant drivers underlying this condition are poorly characterized. Identifying the key hazardous substances contributing to PP thus represents a critical research priority. This study conducted a population-based case–control study to profile the internal exposure to organic pollutants. Using a combination of liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction, we performed suspect screening and nontargeted analysis with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (liquid chromatography-/GC-Orbitrap HRMS). Nontargeted analysis revealed a broad spectrum of EDCs, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalate esters (PAEs), organophosphate esters (OPEs), phenols, amides, and acrylates. Differential analysis between cases and controls further highlighted several pollutant classes, such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), phenols, and chlorinated paraffins. These pollutants were significantly elevated in the PP group. These findings provide new internal exposure data and methodological support for environmental health research. They also offer a scientific foundation for targeted source–control strategies to reduce children’s exposure to harmful pollutants, supporting the broader public health objectives of “Healthy China 2030”."

Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of predicting fault permeability using cumulative seismic moments of MEQs quantitatively. To understand the underlying physical processes, we conduct fault reactivation experiments using Utah FORGE granitoid and analyze acoustic emission (AE) signals generated during stepwise increases in fluid injection pressure. Frequency analysis of thousands of calibrated AE signals reveals that fault reactivation produces multiple AE source patches with millimeter‐scale radii—smaller than the sample fault radius. The cumulative area of the reactivated patches covers the fault multiple times over (∼10x–50x area) for each pressure step. These findings provide mechanistic insight that measured permeability enhancement is not driven by a single large slip event, but by the sequential and interacting activation of multiple slip patches that create a continuous flow pathway."

This study used field observation data to reveal the key factors affecting the albedo of two typical underlying surfaces (bare land, alpine grassland) under snow free conditions. Results show that the solar elevation angle, soil ice content, soil liquid content, and near canopy surface air relative humidity are the primary determinants of albedo for these typical surfaces. Based on these findings, the albedo schemes suitable for the bare land and alpine grassland on the TP have been constructed by considering more comprehensive affecting factors. Evaluation of single‐point simulations at four stations indicates that adopting the new albedo schemes can clearly improve the albedo simulations of Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) with the root mean square error reduced by ∼10% to ∼60% relative to adopting the original albedo schemes, further leading to the surface net radiation simulations improved and thereafter the warm biases of soil temperature simulations reduced by ∼0.2°C to ∼1°C. Regional simulation verification further confirms that adopting the new albedo schemes in CLM5 can obviously improve the surface net radiation simulations by increasing the albedo simulation accuracy on the TP, thereby mainly reducing the overestimation of surface sensible heat flux and land surface temperature by the original albedo schemes, further resulting in the performance of CLM5 to simulate the TP surface heat conditions enhanced."

Whereas prior research on TC climatologies has relied on proxies like Potential Intensity and synthetic storm models, the cyclones simulated by newer TC‐resolving GCMs can now be analyzed directly. This is particularly useful for studying projected global storm distributions under radically altered future climates, including high‐emissions warming scenarios, and those shaped by climate interventions. In this paper, we utilize a high‐resolution model configuration to conduct experiments examining the effects of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) on tropical cyclones. These experiments are constructed based on prior work on SAI, using the Geoengineering Large Ensemble Project (GLENS) ensemble. Our analysis focuses on three uncoupled 10‐year simulations conducted using 30‐km grid spacing and forced with modeled sea surface temperatures from earlier work. The first is a recent‐past calibration run. The second simulates the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 5–8.5, for the years 2090–2099, with no SAI. The third simulation also uses SSP 5–8.5 for the years 2090–2099, but with SAI keeping global temperature rise at no more than 1.5 K. We use a novel TC tracking scheme to analyze resulting changes in storm tracks and properties. Our results show that while SAI may return global storm counts back to late 20th‐century levels, there are still large basin‐by‐basin changes in storm number and intensity. These are likely driven by increases in mean ENSO indices that occur with warming, but seemingly also with intervention."

Here, we investigate the impacts of the TP surface sensible heating on the surrounding Asian cloud fraction and surface radiation budget using numerical climate experiments that vary sensible heat exchange. The TP surface sensible heating, as an elevated heating source, can induce a low‐level cyclone surrounding the TP and ascent over the central‐eastern TP, pumping air into the middle troposphere. Consequently, spring cloud fractions significantly increase over the east TP and East China (EC) owing to the TP surface heating, enhancing cloud radiative effects and longwave radiation but reducing shortwave and net radiation at the surface, whereas the opposite changes occur over the west TP. The summer TP impacts exhibit more substantial changes in both magnitude and spatial coverage relative to spring states. Due to the coupling between the upper and lower circulations forced by the TP surface heating, increased cloud fractions extend over the whole TP in summer, with enhanced ascent and cloud radiative cooling dominated by the shortwave component. Meanwhile, cloud fractions decrease over Central and North Asia, accompanied by abnormal descent, weakened cloud radiative cooling, and minimal change in net surface radiation due to a weak offset between longwave and shortwave radiations. Our results indicate that the TP surface sensible heating significantly influences the distribution and magnitude of the surrounding Asian cloud fraction and surface radiation budget via circulation responses."

Wildfire emissions increase the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere and thus affect cloud properties (e.g., cloud brightness). For this study, we conducted open laboratory burning experiments with less studied biomass types from South African savannah and European boreal forest, to quantify the particle hygroscopicity, an important factor affecting CCN concentrations. We also investigated the effect of burning conditions (characterized by the modified combustion efficiency (MCE)) and aging on the hygroscopicity of the particles. Considering all the experiments, the primary hygroscopicity parameter κ $\kappa $ is constant (0.079 ± $\pm $ 0.007 (mean ± $\pm $ STD) for supersaturation of 0.43%) with respect to MCE for particles from smoldering combustion and increases to a maximum of 0.19 with increasing contribution of flaming. With aging, the hygroscopicity increases (boreal forest biomass) or remains unchanged (savannah biomass) in smoldering experiments, while it decreases in experiments with more flaming‐dominated burning, decreasing the overall variability in κ $\kappa $. Using complementary chemical analysis methods, we provide insights into the markedly different CCN results under different burning conditions. Our results indicate that even in organic carbon‐dominated aerosol representative of wildfires, a small fraction of inorganic material can significantly influence the aerosol hygroscopicity, highlighting the impact of combustion efficiency on biomass burning aerosol CCN activity."

However, the roles of aerosol aqueous conditions in regulating nitrate formation and loss are still poorly constrained. Here, 744 hourly PM2.5 samples collected during the winter of 2023–2024 in a typical northern Chinese city were analyzed to investigate the drivers of severe nitrate pollution. The mean PM2.5 concentration reached 106.0 ± 84.4 μg m−3, with a maximum of 377.8 μg m−3. The NO3−/Total Ions (TI) ratio increased steadily to 43% in 2023, reflecting rising NO2 and effective SO2 emission reductions that shifted winter aerosol composition from sulfate‐to nitrate‐dominated. Four pollution episodes (PE1‐PE4) were identified relative to a clean background period. Both PM2.5 and NO3−/TI ratios were strongly enhanced during all episodes. NO3− exhibited a strong dependence on aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) when ALWC <200 μg m−3, but this relationship weakened at higher ALWC, indicating a transition in dominant formation and loss pathways. Nitrate consistently dominated NH4+ neutralization. PE1 showed the highest aerosol pH but the lowest ALWC and nitrogen oxidation ratio, suggesting that more acidic conditions favor NO2 oxidation. At ALWC >200 μg m−3, gas‐particle partitioning of nitrate approached quasi‐equilibrium, while enhanced deposition indicated accelerated loss. Meanwhile, elevated ALWC increased the particle size through hygroscopic growth, reducing the PM1/PM2.5 ratio. These results demonstrate a threshold‐dependent control of ALWC on nitrate production and removal, with ALWC = 200 μg m−3 representing a critical turning point for wintertime nitrate pollution."

While these drivers independently alter grassland structure, their interactive effects on the critical diversity‐productivity relationship remain poorly understood, particularly under contrasting precipitation regimes. Through a 3‐year split‐plot experiment (four grazing intensities × N addition) in a Loess Plateau steppe, we examined how interannual precipitation variability modulates the effects of grazing and N on the coupling strength between diversity (species richness, SR) and productivity (peak aboveground biomass, ANPP). Three key findings emerged: First, SR–ANPP coupling was strongly precipitation‐dependent: low grazing with N enhanced their synergy in wet years, whereas drought combined with heavy grazing triggered severe decoupling. Second, functional group asynchrony drove these dynamics: ephemeral forbs amplified SR responses to wet years, whereas drought‐tolerant grasses stabilized ANPP but accelerated SR collapse in dry years. Third, soil pathways mediated the coupling dynamics: precipitation and soil C‐N pools facilitated coordination, while grazing‐induced increases in bulk density exerted counteracting effects. Our CDS (Climate‐Disturbance‐Soil feedback) framework demonstrates that moderate grazing optimizes precipitation responsiveness when combined with strategic N inputs, offering actionable thresholds for maintaining coupled ecosystem functions under climate extremes."

We have developed an hourly temporal, 10‐m spatial resolution biogenic CO2 flux estimation framework based on the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) and its variants (UrbanVPRM and VPRM‐modified). Unlike lower‐resolution models, our approach captures finer‐scale variability, particularly in fragmented urban green spaces like street trees and lawns. Results show that vegetation in Munich offsets 2.0%–2.8% of annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the study domain, with tree‐covered areas as primary sinks and grasslands as net sources.

 Growing concerns about plastic pollution and climate change worldwide are driving research into the effects of microplastics on carbon cycling. Although the impacts of microplastics on soil organic carbon (SOC) levels and carbon emissions have been demonstrated, their role in SOC sequestration remains understudied. Here we discuss how interactions between microplastics and organic matter may affect SOC sequestration through biological, geochemical and physical processes. Microplastics and co-occurring contaminants alter SOC content and quality by leaching dissolved organic matter (DOM) and affecting native SOC mineralization. These changes may influence the efficacy of the microbial carbon pump and mineral-associated organic carbon formation. Furthermore, microplastic surfaces adsorb DOM for long-term preservation and form hotspots for mineral–organic matter interactions, thereby altering carbon storage within soil aggregates. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the role of microplastics in soil carbon dynamics, from local to global scales, is essential to address both microplastic pollution and carbon neutrality.

Here, the authors show that weakly localized electrons enhance the electronic coherence in fluorine-functionalized covalent organic frameworks strengthening charge separation and promoting directional electron transport to boost the photocatalytic uranium removal from nuclear wastewater. 
 Photocatalytic uranium removal from nuclear wastewater is a promising strategy for radionuclide mitigation, yet its practical deployment is greatly hampered by inefficient charge separation of electron-hole pairs in photocatalytic systems, which critically limits the generation of reactive oxygen species essential for uranium precipitation. Herein, we propose a approach that leverages weakly localized electrons to enhance electronic coherence in fluorine-functionalized covalent organic frameworks, thereby strengthening charge separation and promoting directional electron transport for greatly boosting photocatalytic uranium removal from nuclear wastewater. We demonstrate that the partial fluorination in covalent organic frameworks induce weak electron localization and strong electronic coherence, which delivers a record-high solar-to-chemicals conversion efficiency of 1.52% and achieves 100% uranium removal efficiency within the pH range of 3-6, outperforming non-fluorinated (0.31%) and over-fluorinated (0.85%) counterparts. More importantly, a self-designed flow-type reactor achieves 99% uranium removal efficiency and superior U processing capacity of 281.3 g m-2 day-1 under natural sunlight, significantly surpassing reported photocatalytic systems and meeting World Health Organization discharge limits. Mechanism investigation reveal that the partial fluorination enhanced electronic coherence improves photogenerated carrier transport and reparation for accelerating reactive oxygen species synthesis, thereby promoting uranium removal from nuclear wastewater.

 Substrate specificity is a defining feature of enzyme function, but its molecular underpinnings remain difficult to decode and engineer. Here, we leverage enzyme proximity sequencing (EP-Seq) to systematically map how single-point and combinatorial mutations reshape the substrate preferences of D-amino acid oxidase (DAOx) from Rhodotorula gracilis, a model promiscuous enzyme. We generate ~40,000 sequence–phenotype pairs, enabling us to profile the activities of ~6,500 unique DAOx variants against five D-amino acid substrates with distinct physicochemical properties. Our analysis reveals that substrate-specific mutations are distributed throughout the enzyme structure. Mutations near the active site drive strong specificity shifts but also incur catalytic penalties, while distal mutations subtly rewire intramolecular contacts in order to modulate specificity with minimal loss of activity. We identify and validate positional hotspots that act allosterically to influence specificity, and characterize key variants that acquire exclusive substrate specificity or exhibit up to 230-fold changes in substrate preference. Combining mutations with complementary effects further sharpens substrate discrimination, enabling rational design of highly selective biocatalysts. This work establishes a powerful framework for decoding enzyme specificity and provides foundational datasets to advance AI-guided enzyme engineering.

Here, we show that PKD1, an 11-transmembrane protein with a noncanonical transient receptor potential (TRP) channel architecture, functions as a GPCR with unique biochemical properties. PKD1 acts as a WNT-activated receptor, directly coupling to heterotrimeric Gαi1-3 subunits to inhibit cellular cAMP accumulation. While PKD1 contains both ligand-binding and G protein recruitment sites, PKD2, an associating TRP channel subunit, chaperones PKD1 to the plasma membrane to operate as a GPCR. This represents a striking departure from classical GPCR architecture and expands the functional repertoire of the TRP channel family. Given that mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 are linked to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, a multisystemic disorder marked by elevated cAMP levels, our results provide molecular insights into disease pathogenesis and highlight potential new therapeutic avenues for this debilitating and costly condition.

 The COVID-19 pandemic prompted widespread school closures and a swift transition to distance learning, raising concerns about consequences for student success. This study explores academic outcomes in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) courses during COVID-induced distance learning using student-course records at an U.S. public university. We particularly focus on students from underserved populations and who have below average academic outcomes. Employing an expected shortfall regression strategy, we examine outcomes in the bottom quintile and compare differences between students whose household income were in the lowest bracket or without a parent holding a four-year college degree and peers for whom this was not the case, in distance and in-person learning. We show that during distance learning, students in disadvantaged populations in the lowest quintile had average grade differences of 0.11 and 0.06 points, respectively. We also find that targeted instructional changes in an introductory physics course were associated with narrower achievement gaps. These results suggest that while distance learning posed challenges for underserved students, deliberate strategies to increase interaction may potentially support greater equity in STEM education.

This study identifies a CD19+ macrophage subset in hepatocellular carcinoma and evaluates strategies to target them for improved immunotherapy. 
 Tumor-associated macrophages are a key component that contributes to the immunosuppressive microenvironment in human cancers. However, therapeutic targeting of macrophages has been a challenge in clinic due to the limited understanding of their heterogeneous subpopulations and distinct functions. Here, we identify a clinically relevant CD19+ subpopulation of macrophages that is enriched in many types of cancer, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CD19+ macrophages exhibit increased levels of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and CD73, enhanced mitochondrial oxidation, and compromised phagocytosis, indicating their immunosuppressive functions. Targeting CD19+ macrophages with anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells inhibited HCC tumor growth. We identify Paired Box 5 (PAX5) as a primary driver of up-regulated mitochondrial biogenesis in CD19+ macrophages, which depletes cytoplasmic Ca2+, leading to lysosomal deficiency and consequent accumulation of CD73 and PD-L1. Inhibiting CD73 or mitochondrial oxidation enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in treating HCC, suggesting great promise for CD19+ macrophage-targeting therapeutics.

 China experienced substantial millennial-scale climate and anthropogenic land use changes, yet their combined impacts on land carbon dynamics remain largely unexamined. Here, we quantify spatiotemporal changes in terrestrial organic carbon over 851–2022 using a land surface model driven by reconstructed climate and land cover forcings. Simulated results show China’s pre-industrial millennial land carbon dynamics aligned with global carbon stock and atmospheric CO2 fluctuations, such as the ~284 ppm peak in the 12th century linked to land use during the Medieval Climate Anomaly-warmed Song Dynasty. Notably, China’s total land carbon emissions (13 ± 0.5 PgC) accounted for 22% of global land carbon emissions during 1700–1900, with Northeast and Southwest China experiencing the largest historical land carbon losses from intensive deforestation. Nevertheless, the 17.0 ± 1.7 PgC emissions during 851–1980 were fully offset by rapid carbon sinks over 1980–2022, driven by CO2 fertilization and large-scale afforestation. These findings provide insights into China’s historical land carbon dynamics, their underlying drivers, and global implications.

Here, authors introduce a model with critical mass dynamics that explains how rumors spread and fade in online groups, uncovering tipping points and showing agreement with real message cascades on social media platform. 
 The rapid spread of information and rumors through social media platforms, especially in group settings, motivates the need for more sophisticated models of rumor propagation. Traditional pairwise models do not account for group interactions, a limitation that we address by proposing a higher-order rumor model based on hypergraphs. Our model incorporates a group-based annihilation mechanism, where a spreader becomes a stifler when the fraction of hyperedges aware of the rumor exceeds a threshold. The dynamics has two distinct subcritical behaviors: exponential and power-law decay, which can coexist depending on the heterogeneity of the hypergraph. Interestingly, in the set of parameters we analysed, we found continuous phase transitions in both homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs. This finding aligns with the literature suggesting that real-world rumor propagation occurs near criticality. Finally, we validated our model using empirical data from Telegram and email cascades, which provides additional evidence and possible explanations for this criticality claim. These results open the door to a more detailed understanding of rumor dynamics in higher-order systems. Rumors often spread through collective exposure rather than simple pairwise contacts. Here, authors introduce a model with critical mass dynamics that explains how rumors spread and fade in online groups, uncovering tipping points and showing agreement with real message cascades on social media platform."

 A past 3-million-year transient simulation with Community Earth System Model version 1.2 reveals precessional dominance in El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability intensity and spatial structure. Under boreal winter-solstice perihelion (like late Holocene), basin-scale ENSO variability intensifies through strengthened thermocline and zonal advective feedbacks, driven by a broad El Niño-like mean surface warming and enhanced tropical Pacific rainbands. Under boreal vernal-equinox perihelion, central-Pacific ENSO variability shifts eastward moderately, primarily due to intensified zonal advective feedback, following a strengthened background South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and interhemispherically opposing rainband changes. ENSO responses under boreal summer-solstice and autumn-equinox perihelion are contrastingly weaker. Consequently, both ENSO characteristics coevolve with the precession’s magnitude set by orbital eccentricity. Precessional modulation of ENSO progressively strengthened toward the present, mediated by a gradually intensified background SPCZ under greenhouse gas and ice-sheet forcings. We suggest that sea surface warming patterns and associated tropical rainbands are paramount in past ENSO changes."

 The Gulf Stream is part of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The AMOC is a tipping element and may collapse under changing forcing. However, the role of the Gulf Stream in such a tipping event is unknown. Here, we investigate the link between the AMOC and Gulf Stream using a high-resolution (0. 1°) stand-alone ocean simulation, in which the AMOC collapses under a slowly-increasing freshwater forcing. AMOC weakening gradually shifts the Gulf Stream near Cape Hatteras northward, followed by an abrupt northward displacement of 219 km within 2 years. This rapid shift occurs a few decades before the simulated AMOC collapse. Satellite altimetry shows a significant (1993–2024, p < 0.05) northward Gulf Stream trend near Cape Hatteras, which is also confirmed in subsurface temperature observations (1965–2024, p < 0.01).

 Understanding the impacts of permafrost thawing on the carbon cycle requires a closer look at the proportion of dissolved and particulate organic carbon released upon thaw, and the magnitude of its conversion into greenhouse gases, which remain critically underexplored. In Central Yakutia (Siberia), we show evidence of contrasting influence of permafrost degradation on dissolved and particulate organic matter in both old and recent thermokarst lakes. Particulate organic carbon is largely modern and originates from lake primary production. In contrast, up to 75% of dissolved organic carbon originates from permafrost thaw in recent lakes and early-Holocene lakes modified by recent thermokarst, leading to the highest concentrations ever measured in such lakes.

 Glacial melting in West Antarctica has intensified with the increased intrusion of warm ocean water beneath ice shelves, but the processes controlling the export of meltwater-associated micronutrient iron (Fe) to Southern Ocean surface waters remain unclear. Here, we report Fe concentrations and dissolved Fe (dFe) isotope ratios in the inflowing deepwater layer that drives melting of the Dotson Ice Shelf and in the meltwater-enriched outflow to determine meltwater-derived dFe. Isotopic mass balance points to an anoxic Fe-reducing region of the upstream subglacial hydrologic system as the dominant source of meltwater dFe, rather than ice shelf melt itself. Remarkably, total meltwater contributes only ~10% of outflowing dFe, with the majority contributed by inflowing deep water (62%), augmented by inputs from shelf sediments (28%). Outflowing suspended particulate Fe exceeds inflow by 46%, at 100 times the dFe concentration, with 25% in reactive phases. Predictive models of future ecosystem effects should consider that the primary role of ice shelf melting is to provide buoyancy that transports Fe from deep sources to the Fe-limited surface ocean, stimulating phytoplankton growth.

 The COVID-19 pandemic inadvertently offered a condition to evaluate how abrupt human-activity reductions affect freshwater ecosystems, particularly water turbidity. Using satellite-derived data from 774 lakes worldwide (2017–2022), here we show turbidity declined significantly in highly turbid zones of lakes following COVID-19 containment, with minor effects elsewhere. Globally, average peak turbidity decreased 7.0% in 2020 relative to 2019; 5.9% was directly attributable to containment measures, independent of climate. Without these measures, peak turbidity would have been ~5% higher (0.45 Nephelometric Turbidity Units) during 2020–2022. Lakes in regions with stricter containment and higher anthropogenic footprint exhibited larger declines and faster rebounds post-restriction. Among individual lakes, 75.2% experienced average peak turbidity reductions. For 168 lakes, containment-driven improvements averaged –18.6%, strongly correlated with reduced night-time light as a proxy for anthropogenic inputs. By disentangling human and climatic influences, our study provides globally relevant, actionable insights for targeted lake restoration strategies.

Unlike previous methods requiring specialized geographic analysis tools or domain expertise, SpatialLLM leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to address various spatial intelligence tasks. The core of SpatialLLM lies in constructing detailed and structured scene descriptions from raw spatial data to prompt LLMs for scene-based analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with our designs, general-purpose LLMs can accurately perceive spatial distribution information and execute advanced spatial intelligence tasks, including urban planning, ecological analysis, traffic management. We further investigate key factors influencing LLM performance in urban analysis, such as multi-field knowledge, context length, and reasoning ability. We hope that SpatialLLM offers a viable perspective for intelligent urban analysis and management. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/SpatialLLM."

 Under a sustained warming climate, reservoir‐area landslides exhibit increasingly complex, non-linear interactions. The cascade “climate or seasonal variability-soil rheology-vegetation response/feedback-impulse-wave risk” constitutes an emerging safety threat in alpine gorge reservoirs; yet how such cascades propagate—and how their key links manifest—remains insufficiently resolved. Here, adopting a geomorphological–ecological, multi-feedback perspective, we develop a research paradigm that couples heterogeneous geological modeling with surface-ecosystem diagnostics and analyses of spatiotemporal lag effects, and apply it to an empirical study of the Likan Landslides in the Lijia Gorge Reservoir on the upper Yellow River. We show that the landslide undergoes a northward-deflecting motion as a quasi-rigid block, and we identify and quantitatively characterize three heterogeneous zones with distinct activity signatures: (1) Horizontally dominated displacement zone (0.7 km2; mean thickness 10.6 m; maximum displacement rate 73 mm yr⁻1) showing thick-slope shear-creep behavior; (2) Downslope displacement-dominated zone (0.3 km2; 7.9 m; 33 mm yr⁻1) characterized by thin-slope creep and brittle unloading; (3) Severe dual-motion zone (2.2 × 10⁻2 km2; 7.03 m; 33–73 mm yr⁻1) manifesting block tensile-fracture movement. We further detect a 3–6-month lag between precipitation forcing and landslide response, coupled with a vegetation recovery suppression effect, confirming the system as a hydrologically lag-driven, progressive heterogeneous landslide. Its long-term creep–spatial differentiation–environmental feedback composite mechanism induces cumulative damage to the ground surface and poses the potential to trigger secondary wave surges. The study establishes a multi-field coupling framework of remote sensing that links process analysis with risk-warning decision-making, provides an empirical case for understanding landslide responses under climate change, and offers a transferable paradigm for cascading landslide risk assessment in reservoir regions."

 Aviation emissions of ultrafine particles and nitrogen oxides have adverse effects on climate, air quality, and public health. Modern engines tend to emit less pollutants and carbon dioxide by improving combustion technology and reducing fuel consumption. However, the performance of these optimized engines under real-world operating conditions remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted field measurements of particle number (PN), NO, and CO2 concentrations during the aircraft taxi-out, landing, and take-off phases by utilizing a roadside platform situated near the taxiway. We successfully identified 1,040 PN plumes and 582 NO plumes for calculating real-world aircraft engine emission factors. The median engine-specific PN emission factors range from 1.5 × 1016 to 7.3 × 1016 particles/kg-fuel, which was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than non-volatile PN emission factors reported by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), indicating substantial emissions of volatile and semi-volatile particles from aviation sources under real-world operational conditions. The median engine-specific NO emission factors varied from 1.9 to 29.0 g/kg. Notably, a significantly higher NO emission factor was observed for new-generation engines compared to their predecessors. Additionally, an inverse variation trend between NO and PN emission factors was identified across different operating phases and engine types. Linear regression yielded slopes of −2 × 1015 and −8 × 1015, accompanied by coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.63 and 0.92, respectively. These findings underscore a trade-off between improved fuel efficiency and increased pollutant emissions. Furthermore, thrust settings, aircraft maximum take-off weight (MTOW) as well as aircraft service duration were also found to exert considerable influence on PN and NO emissions."

 This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient framework for the inverse identification of atmospheric pollution sources, with a focus on real-time applicability in complex environments. The proposed method combines stochastic modelling of pollutant dispersion with Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HoSVD) and machine learning-based surrogate modelling. A case study centred on the Singapore region demonstrates the method’s ability to accurately reconstruct pollution fields from sparse sensor data over a 900-hour simulation window. The approach leverages a multi-objective optimization strategy, using Gaussian Process Regression (notably, the regression task is carried out in a parametric space of relatively low dimensionality) to approximate parametric modes and the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm for source localization. Results show that the localization error remains within a fraction of the spatial grid resolution, and the entire computational pipeline—from simulation to optimization—can be executed in under 30 min on standard desktop hardware. This efficiency enables frequent or continuous deployment in operational monitoring systems. The framework’s modularity allows for extension to higher-dimensional parametric spaces, making it suitable for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications."

 Amines in fine particles influence atmospheric chemistry by promoting the formation of new particles and contributing to the growth of secondary aerosol mass through acid-base reactions and aminium salt formation. To investigate their abundance, seasonal dynamics, and sources of particulate amines in different environments in Pakistan, concurrent particulate matter (PM2.5) sampling campaigns were conducted at an urban site in Lahore and a rural site in Bhakkar, during the summer (southwest monsoon) and winter of 2022. We report an unexpected observation: the total mean concentrations of thirteen quantified amines are significantly higher in the rural area (60.52 ng m−3 in summer; 79.57 ng m−3 in winter) than in the urban area (1.88 ng m−3 in summer; 11.63 ng m−3 in winter), revealing a reversed urban-rural gradient. Both sites exhibited consistent wintertime enhancements. Dimethylamine was the most abundant species (17–48% of total amines), followed by diethylamine (7–23%) and ethylamine (1–17%). The concentrations of amines showed strong positive correlations with sulfur dioxide, PM2.5, and organic carbon, and were elevated during periods of low temperatures and weak winds, suggesting thermodynamic partitioning of haze in winter. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model identified distinct sources, with rural amines mainly contributed by proteinaceous waste emissions and agrochemical emissions (40.7% and 34.1% respectively). In contrast, urban amines were primarily contributed by waste and biomass burning, fugitive dust, and chemical manufacturing (60.2%, 19.1%, and 14.0% respectively). This study reveals a significant predominance of particulate amines in rural Pakistan, challenging the conventional view of urban-industrial dominance and highlighting the critical influence of localized agricultural and domestic sources on atmospheric chemistry."

 As a typical coastal city in northern China, Tianjin often suffered severe co-pollution of PM2.5 and ozone (O3), with maximum daily 8h average ozone concentration (MDA8 O3) ≥ 160 μg m−3 and the daily mean PM2.5 concentration (PM2.5_24h) ≥ 35 μg m−3 during the warm season (April-September). However, the meteorological characteristics and formation mechanism of co-pollution in Tianjin remain unclear. In this study, the temporal variations of co-polluted days in Tianjin were analyzed based on the observation data from 2017 to 2024. Two typical episodes were selected to investigate the meteorological influence and driving factors of co-pollution by using Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The number of co-polluted days fell during 2018-2021 and rose to 35 days in 2024, which accounted for 45.5% of the total polluted days during the warm season in Tianjin. The MDA8 O3 on co-polluted days was higher than that on O3-single polluted days, highlighting the role of intensified atmospheric oxidation. Co-pollution is prone to occur on the days with high temperature and relative humidity, weak wind or sea-land circulation and temperature inversion. Two formation mechanisms of co-pollution in Tianjin were investigated. The O3-initiated co-pollution on June 27, 2020 was characterized by a rise in O3 firstly and a subsequent increase in PM2.5. Process analysis and source apportionment simulations revealed that aerosol chemistry was the main source of secondary inorganic aerosols, and local production was the largest regional source to MDA8 O3 in Tianjin, with an average contribution of 21.76%, suggesting that local chemical production under strong atmospheric oxidation is the primary driver of O3-initiated co-pollution. In contrast, the PM2.5-initiated co-pollution on April 8, 2022 began with elevated PM2.5, which was attributed to regional transport and accumulation caused by unfavorable meteorological conditions (sea-land breeze and temperature inversion). Subsequently, O3 increased as precursors transported from Shandong (25.57%) and other adjacent regions (23.56%). This study emphasized the importance of reducing atmospheric oxidation and regional collaboration for co-pollution prevention and control in northern coastal areas."

 This study investigates how sea-breeze fronts (SBFs) and gust fronts (GFs) influence the initiation, intensification, and evolution of convective cells, focusing on a series of “back-building” supercells that occurred in Shanghai on 5 July 2017. Multiple observational and modeling datasets were investigated, including weather radar, sounding data, wind profilers, and the cloud-resolving model CM1. Results indicate that the development of the SBF significantly modified the boundary-layer wind structure and enhanced low-level vertical wind shear. When superimposed with the strong outflow boundary of the supercell, this leads to a substantial increase in storm-relative helicity, affecting convective cell intensity, lifespan, and propagation—key factors in supercell formation and development. The study also identifies a potential mechanism for backward propagation: intensification of the SBF and GF created an unstable Kelvin-Helmholtz layer atop the cold pool, which is inferred to have excited gravity waves. These waves likely contributed to enhanced updrafts and thickening of the cold pool. Additionally, interaction between the cold pool and the ambient southwesterly jet produced a new low-level jet, further strengthening the updraft. These findings advance the understanding of the back-building supercell dynamics in eastern coastal China and provide valuable insights for nowcasting and early warning."

 The diurnal temperature range (DTR), defined as the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperatures, is a key indicator of diurnal climate variability and a sensitive measure of model performance. Since 1901, the observed global DTR has declined significantly, a trend previously underestimated by climate models. Here, we show that the latest model ensemble of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) simulates this decline more accurately than CMIP5. This improvement is primarily due to a stronger overall response to external forcings, particularly from greenhouse gases (GHG) and natural forcing (NAT), which leads to a multi-model mean trend much closer to observations. Furthermore, optimal fingerprinting analysis reveals a fundamental shift in attribution structure: while CMIP5 attributes the change almost solely to GHG, CMIP6 supports a more physically coherent, multi-forcing framework in which GHG remains dominant but statistically detectable contributions from NAT and anthropogenic aerosols (AER) emerge, collectively yielding a more realistic forcing synergy. CMIP6 also better captures the distinct regional DTR patterns driven by anthropogenic aerosols. A central reason for this enhanced forcing response is the higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) in CMIP6 models. Models with ECS values closer to observationally constrained estimates simulate a more substantial and consistent DTR decline. This link is likely due to improved cloud physics, which simultaneously elevates ECS and refines the surface solar radiation variations driving DTR. Therefore, CMIP6's superior performance stems from a more realistic physical basis rather than error compensation. These findings deepen the understanding of DTR changes and provide key insights for future climate model development."

 Tornadoes are common atmospheric phenomena worldwide; however, the mechanisms governing non-supercell tornadoes, particularly anticyclonic ones, remain less well understood, especially in regions with complex terrain. In Mexico, a considerable number of non-supercell tornadoes exhibit clockwise rotation, and some studies suggest a potential link between topography and these phenomena. In this context, this study investigates two anticyclonic non-supercell tornadoes that occurred in central Mexico: one in Tlaxcala (2016) and another in Querétaro (2017) states, both within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Using high-resolution simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model, complemented by satellite and reanalysis data, we analyze the environments that favored the development of these events. Both cases occurred under moderate instability, with weak to moderate wind shear and marked moisture flux convergence, modulated by orographic features. Results of model simulations show that mountain-induced perturbations generated alternating cyclonic and anticyclonic vertical vorticity fields along low-level convergence lines. The advection of negative vertical vorticity, coupled with vertical motion associated with convective updrafts, favored the initiation of anticyclonic rotation. Therefore, a schematic conceptual model is proposed to describe this process, emphasizing the key role of wind-orography interactions in producing surface vertical vorticity dipoles that may later evolve into non-supercell tornadoes. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for topographic influences in evaluating tornadic potential in complex terrains, providing a framework for understanding the relatively high frequency of anticyclonic vortices in regions with complex orography."

 Clouds play a critical role in regulating the Earth's radiation budget and water cycle, and their microphysical properties (e.g., optical thickness, effective radius, and phase) are of great importance for understanding climate change and precipitation formation. In this study, a cloud detection and water cloud droplet size retrieval approach is proposed based on observations from the Polarization Multi-Angle Imager (PMAI) onboard China's new-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite FY-3G. Polarization characteristics from the shortwave infrared bands at 1030 nm, 1370 nm, and 1640 nm are utilized. Cloud masking and phase classification are performed through the combined use of multi-band reflectance and polarization ratios, whereas the effective radius of water clouds is retrieved from a lookup table (LUT) generated with the UNL-VRTM vector radiative transfer model. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits strong robustness under different surface conditions (ocean, forest–grassland, and desert). Compared with MODIS (MYD06) products, the overall cloud detection accuracy exceeds 70%, with recall rates higher than 80%. The recall rate for water cloud identification is generally above 85%, and the retrieved effective radius shows a Pearson correlation coefficient of approximately 0.6 with MODIS, validating the reliability and potential of the method. This study provides important technical support for enhancing the application of multi-angle polarimetric observations in detailed retrievals of cloud microphysical properties, offering valuable reference for climate change monitoring and model improvement."

 Methane (CH4) is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Its vertical distribution is crucial in identifying emission sources and evaluating climate impacts. This study aims to retrieve atmospheric CH4 vertical profiles from the observations of the second-generation Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS-II) onboard the Fengyun-3F (FY-3F) satellite. Based on information entropy, the most sensitive spectral channels were selected, and a damped Newton algorithm was employed to retrieve the vertical distribution of CH₄ volume mixing ratios. The retrievals were validated against ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic observations from the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). The comparison shows that the correlation coefficient of the column-averaged CH₄ concentrations within the 300–500 hPa layer exceeds 0.75, with relative deviations of less than ±3%. Taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region as a representative area, the spatiotemporal variations in CH4 concentrations during 2024 were analyzed.

 Under the climatological background of increasing trend of sub-daily and hourly precipitation extremes over North China Plain (NCP) since 2000, sub-daily and hourly precipitation extremes have substantially increased in association with extraordinary persistent heavy rainfall events (PHREs) with record-breaking flash heavy rainfalls (FHRs). They attack the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration and thus bring casualties, ecological environment damages, economic losses, and public sentiments due to the less accurate predictions for FHRs during PHREs. Based on long-term observational and reanalysis datasets, quantitative characteristics for precipitation, synoptic circulations, and thermodynamic environments are revealed for FHRs during PHREs under meridional and zonal synoptic patterns (MT and ZT). Precipitations exhibit significant differences over complex underlying surfaces. Compared to PHREs, fiercer FHRs over the plain subdomain are associated with stronger high-level atmospheric circulations, amplified low-level water vapor transports, and increased ascending motions compared to their climatological averages. During FHRs under MT, there is an extra water vapor channel. Spatial distributions of the six indices, i.e., CAPE, K index, SI, Δθe, RH, T-Td, in FHRs during 40 PHREs in the past 25 years are investigated in comparisons to their corresponding annual and event averages. It is found out that CAPE and KI present larger values over the plain subdomain. CAPE, SI, and Δθe all exhibit terrain-following features under both patterns with stronger magnitudes under MT, while the other three exhibit latitudinal contrasts with similar medians and more concentrated thresholds. Favorable thermodynamic indices and their thresholds with medians for FHRs are concluded in this study to provide quantitative scientific evidence for improving potential prediction skills for FHRs during PHREs at different geographic locations over NCP under two dominant synoptic patterns, and with varied intensities. What's more, the corresponding characteristics are quantitatively analyzed for three extremely severe PHREs in late July 2021, 2023, and 2025 as a comparison and application to the most recent events."

However, the energetics and timescales of these feedback processes are poorly constrained. We combined optical, infrared, submillimeter, and radio observations of the active galaxy VV 340a, which is hosting a low-power jet launched from a supermassive black hole at its center. We found that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 ± 5.5) × 105years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 ± 7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma that extends several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star-formation rate."

However, barriers against IAV transmission remain elusive. We demonstrated human stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as a transmission barrier against IAVs. STING activated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and downstream NF-κB–stimulated genes (NSGs) through a specific domain. Among these NSGs,growth arrest and DNA damage–inducible protein 34(GADD34) was crucial for IAV restriction. Some IAVs have evolved to evade activating human STING by mutating residue 115 in their matrix protein 1 (M1), which is essential for efficient viral replication in human respiratory cells. This barrier against the zoonotic threat of IAVs provides a tool for future investigations into the biological functions of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monosphosphate (cGMP-AMP) synthase (cGAS)–STING–NF-κB signaling pathway."

Mammalian transition to daytime activity accelerated after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We identified a conserved cell-intrinsic, thermodynamic mechanism that likely facilitated this shift. In cells from diurnal mammals, protein synthesis, phosphorylation, and circadian timing were less sensitive to temperature changes than were cells from nocturnal mammals. Comparative genomics revealed accelerated evolution within essential signaling pathways, including mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), that increase the robustness of diurnal cellular clocks to thermal and osmotic perturbation. In nocturnal mice, mTOR inhibition shifted cells, tissues, and behavior toward diurnal activity. These findings uncover a genetic and biochemical basis for nocturnal-diurnal switching, emphasizing how cellular signaling networks can encode complex phenotypes such as temporal niche selection."

We screened for cellular factors that influence site-specific transgene synthesis into the human genome by an R2 retrotransposon protein. We discovered that insertion lengths and junction signatures differ based on alternative repair processes involving ATR-dependent polymerase θ end joining, 53BP1-directed shieldin and CST–polymerase α–primase fill-in synthesis, or limited strand annealing dependent on CtIP-MRN.

In roots, OsWRI1a enhances N-responsive development by promoting auxin accumulation. Meanwhile, shoot OsWRI1a stimulates tiller development and therefore shoot growth. We identified an eliteOsWRI1ahaplotype that minimizes root-to-shoot ratio fluctuation under N deficiency, improving N-use efficiency and grain yield.

This QP ceramic exhibited ad33of ~6850 pC/N, which surpasses that of commercial PZT ceramics by 10 to 30 times and commercial lead magnesium niobate–lead titanate single crystals by ~4 times.

The method utilizes a bifunctional peptide catalyst to template the terminal functional groups of the linear precursor, thereby favoring intra- over intermolecular reaction and enabling exquisite control over the stereochemistry of the emerging stereogenic centers. Diverse 12- to 18‐membered macrocyclic lactones and lactams were obtained from achiral linear precursors. The organocatalyst even dictates the stereochemical outcome upon cyclizing a chiral linear precursor.

Cellular states from broadly distributed lineages displayed synchronized dynamics with age, indicating systemic signals that coordinate these changes. Molecular analyses identified both intrinsic regulators (chromatin peaks, transcription factor activity) and extrinsic factors (cytokine programs) underlying these shifts. Moreover, ~40% of aging-associated population dynamics were sex-dependent, with tens of thousands of peaks altered exclusively in one sex.

This metric was inspired by the phenomenology observed in a model for gut microbiome dynamics that we introduce in this work, which revealed alternative stable states with distinct emergent microbial communities: a healthy state dominated by negative interactions and a dysbiotic state dominated by positive interactions. The ENBI robustly differentiates these states in both simulated and empirical datasets spanning multiple diseases and correlates with disease progression in conditions such as colorectal cancer, which underscores its potential as a diagnostic tool."

Here, we report a culture method for generating fetal testicular somatic cell–like cells (fTeSLCs) from embryonic stem cells. These fTeSLCs exhibit a transcriptomic profile closely resembling that of their in vivo counterparts, including distinct cell populations corresponding to Sertoli cells and interstitial cells. For functional assessment, interstitial cell–like cells (ICLCs) and Sertoli-like cells (SerLCs) were isolated from fTeSLCs. ICLCs differentiated into Leydig cells when cocultured with testes lacking endogenous Leydig cells, thereby restoring androgenic support. SerLCs reconstituted the seminiferous epithelium following selective ablation of endogenous Sertoli cells. Both cell types supported spermatogenesis and generated spermatids reaching the elongating stage. Notably, round spermatids derived from these reconstructed systems produced viable offspring by round spermatid injection. These findings demonstrate that fTeSLCs can generate functional testicular somatic cells, providing a valuable platform for studying testis development and spermatogenesis."
