10.1088/1748-9326/add6b8,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注农业用水效率和地下水管理，利用卫星数据估算农作物的水生产力，并评估在加州圣华金谷的地下水超采盆地中节水的潜力。它侧重于农田尺度的作物生产和用水动态，旨在为灌溉区管理者提供有针对性的干预措施，并更有效地分配国家激励措施以改善水资源管理。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Corisa A Wong;David B Lobell;Meagan S Mauter,Field-scale mapping of California crop water productivity to inform water management in critically overdrafted groundwater basins,"Crop water productivity (CWP) metrics can reveal how the dynamics of crop production and water use change across space and time. We use field-scale satellite inputs from 2016–2021 to estimate potential water savings for four crops (almonds, grapes, walnuts, and citrus—which collectively account for approximately one-third of California’s cropland area), within critically overdrafted groundwater sub-basins of California’s San Joaquin Valley. These annual estimates of field-level water savings potential are based on locally achievable CWP values for each crop type. Our findings show considerable spatial variation in CWP and potential water savings within each sub-basin. We find that increasing CWP to peak efficiency (defined as improving fields to the 95th percentile of observed CWP) for four crops could meet up to 36% of the estimated annual overdraft in San Joaquin Valley. For comparison, fallowing 5% of the four crop type fields in the same study area could potentially reduce annual overdraft by 11%. By delivering results at the field scale, our work can inform targeted interventions by irrigation district managers and more efficient allocation of state incentives for improved water management. For example, we estimate that state grant funding for water efficiency upgrades could have amplified potential water savings threefold by targeting investments to the least efficient fields."
10.1088/1748-9326/addc81,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注南美洲干旱地区的集约化养牛模式，利用卫星图像识别圈养牛只的区域，并将这些区域分为饲养场、集中动物饲养场和补充饲养区。研究旨在了解集约化养牛的分布、地理位置、环境影响以及与热带森林砍伐的关系。虽然使用了卫星图像，但其重点在于土地利用和农业实践，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Tobias Kuemmerle;Pedro D Fernández;Matthias Baumann;Jamie Burton,Uncovering patterns of cattle intensification across South America’s dry diagonal,"Where cattle production expands into natural ecosystems, it typically leads to stark social–ecological impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity losses, and ecosystem degradation. This is particularly the case in South America’s tropical forests and savannas, where much hope is placed in intensifying cattle production instead of further expanding it. Yet, where such an intensification is already happening and how it is associated with deforestation patterns remains elusive. Here, we pioneer the use of satellite imagery to identify areas where cattle are confined—a key indicator of intensified cattle production—across the entire 3.7 million km2 South American dry diagonal; a global hotspot of cattle production and deforestation. We subsequently use an active-learning approach to separate these confinement areas into (1) feedlots, (2) concentrated animal feeding operations, and (3) supplementary feeding areas. Our results show that confinement areas are ubiquitous in the dry diagonal. We identified 253 large, industrialized feedlots and more than 3200 medium-sized concentrated animal feeding operations—together containing an estimated 13 million cattle head—and more than 4000 supplementary feeding sites on pastures. Feedlots were found mostly in the Cerrado (n = 141), followed by Chaco (n = 93), and were less frequent in the Chiquitano and Caatinga regions. Feedlots occurred predominantly in areas of high cropland cover and low levels of deforestation, while supplementary feeding sites were associated with higher shares of deforestation. Independent validation suggests our methodology can identify confinement areas robustly (97% user’s accuracy) and separate feedlots, concentrated animal feeding operations, and supplementary feeding sites accurately (F1-score 0.91 ± 0.01). Thus, our scalable approach has the potential to provide an advancement in our understanding of the distribution of cattle production systems, the geography of ranching intensification, the environmental impacts of beef production, and the relationship between ranching intensification and tropical deforestation."
10.1088/1748-9326/addd34,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要探讨了热带地区大气环流现象，特别是Madden-Julian振荡（MJO）与准两年振荡（QBO）以及对流层两年振荡（TBO）之间的联系。研究发现对流层上部存在明显的两年振荡，并且该振荡与MJO存在显著相关性。论文强调了平流层-对流层耦合在热带地区的重要性，并通过MJO动力学进行联系。虽然该研究涉及大气现象，但其重点在于气候振荡和大气环流的相互作用，而不是直接关于大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Madden-Julian Oscillation', 'Quasi-Biennial Oscillation', 'Tropospheric Biennial Oscillation', 'Stratosphere-Troposphere Coupling', 'Tropical Climate']",Feiyang Wang;Tanlong Dai;Yuanyuan Han,Observed connection between the Madden–Julian oscillation and the upper tropospheric biennial oscillation,"It has been found that the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the stratosphere have an important impact on the Madden Julian oscillation (MJO). In this study, we show that there is an obvious biennial oscillation in the tropical upper troposphere, which may be an unnoticed component of the known tropospheric biennial oscillation (TBO). More interestingly, similar to the QBO-MJO connection, the upper TBO is also significant correlated with MJO during boreal winter and summer. The responses of the amplitude and occurrence frequency of the eight MJO phases are broadly stronger and higher during the weak TBO when compared to the strong TBO. Our findings imply a previously underestimated multifaceted stratosphere-troposphere coupling in the tropics through MJO dynamics. The causality and mechanism of the TBO-MJO connection need further discussion in the future."
10.1088/1748-9326/addd36,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在气候和可持续发展政策中的应用，通过案例研究评估了LLMs在分类和情感分析方面的能力。研究重点在于利用LLMs分析气候承诺对其他可持续发展维度的影响，以及识别可持续发展目标之间的相互作用。论文还讨论了LLMs在知识生产过程中存在的局限性，并提出了风险缓解策略。虽然涉及气候问题，但其核心是关于AI技术在政策分析中的应用，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或卫星观测。,"['climate pledges', 'sustainability', 'sustainable development goals', 'policy implications', 'large language models', 'decision-making']",F Larosa;S Hoyas;J A Conejero;J Garcia-Martinez;F Fuso-Nerini;R Vinuesa,Large language models in climate and sustainability policy: limits and opportunities,"Accurate, reliable and updated information support effective decision-making by reducing uncertainty and enabling informed choices. Multiple crises threaten the sustainability of our societies and pose at risk the planetary boundaries, hence requiring usable and operational knowledge. Natural-language processing tools facilitate data collection, extraction and analysis processes. They expand knowledge utilization capabilities by improving access to reliable sources in shorter time. They also identify patterns of similarities and contrasts across diverse contexts. We apply general and domain-specific large language models (LLMs) to two case studies and we document appropriate uses and shortcomings of these tools for two tasks: classification and sentiment analysis of climate and sustainability documents. We study both statistical and prompt-based methods. In the first case study, we use LLMs to assess whether climate pledges trigger cascade effects in other sustainability dimensions. In the second use case, we use LLMs to identify interactions between the sustainable development goals and detects the direction of their links to frame meaningful policy implications. We find that LLMs are successful at processing, classifying and summarizing heterogeneous text-based data helping practitioners and researchers accessing. LLMs detect strong concerns from emerging economies in addressing food security, water security and urban challenges as primary issues. Developed economies, instead, focus their pledges on the energy transition and climate finance. We also detect and document four main limits along the knowledge production chain: interpretability, external validity, replicability and usability. These risks threaten the usability of findings and can lead to failures in the decision-making process. We recommend risk mitigation strategies to improve transparency and literacy on artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to complex policy problems. Our work presents a critical but empirically grounded application of LLMs to climate and sustainability questions and suggests avenues to further expand controlled and risk-aware AI-powered computational social sciences."

Results highlight pronounced regional disparities, with regions like the Tibetan Plateau, Mongolia, and the Arabian Peninsula emerging as persistent hotspots due to rapid warming responses. In contrast, the southeastern United States exhibits early-stage declines, though vulnerability to extreme weather is growing. A latitude-time analysis reveals asymmetric hemispheric trajectories, driven by distinct climate dynamics and anthropogenic influences. The transition from systemic temperature-influenced hotspots to localized, extreme event-influenced phenomena underscores the intensifying impact of extreme climate events. These findings provide critical insights into the spatial and temporal evolution of climate change impacts and highlight the necessity of region-specific adaptation strategies."
10.1088/1748-9326/addee2,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注中国的水资源问题，特别是虚拟水贸易中的水资源责任分配。它引入了三维水足迹（3DWF）的概念，并分析了中国不同地区的水资源稀缺性和经济价值对水资源责任的影响。研究重点在于水资源在供应链中的转移、不平等分配以及各地区对不平等现象的贡献。虽然水资源与环境有间接联系，但该论文并未直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Ziyi Wei;Xiaomeng Wang;Yajuan Yu;Zhen Wang;Kai Huang,"Rethinking the responsibility for China’s water withdrawal: distribution, supply chain and inequality","Virtual water trade (VWT) links local water withdrawal (WW) with distant consumption. Given the significant contradictions between China’s water demand and supply, it is urgent to clarify the responsibilities for WW (RWW) in VWT. Previous studies considering this responsibility have focused solely on the absolute volume of WW; however, the disparities in water availability and economic capacity lead to differing implications of the same WW action across regions. Here, to reassess the RWW, we introduce water scarcity index and value-added to WW and propose the concept of the three-dimensional water footprint (3DWF). We reveal the distribution distinction between WW and 3DWF among China’s regions. In addition, we explore how the 3DWF is transferred within the supply chain and further reveal its inequality and the contributions of regions to the inequality. We find that the distribution of 3DWF has changed dramatically compared to WW, primarily concentrating in China’s economic center. The 3DWF inequality primarily results from the distribution of 3DWF-local, with a Gini coefficient of 0.7556. Xinjiang has only 1.8% of the population but is responsible for 22% of the 3DWF-local in China and has become the largest contributor to the inequality. Notably, this inequality is mitigated when 3DWF-non-local is taken into account. Our findings provide new insights into the establishment of rigid constraints and the sustainable spatial deployment of water resources."
10.1088/1748-9326/addee4,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注在净零排放情景下，欧洲极端高温事件的长期影响。它使用地球系统模型模拟，研究了延迟实现净零排放对欧洲地区最高气温的影响，并量化了不同地区极端高温事件发生的频率变化。虽然该研究与大气环境有关，但它侧重于气候变化和温度预测，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['heat extremes', 'climate change', 'net-zero emissions', 'temperature projections', 'Earth system models']",Eduardo Alastrué de Asenjo;Andrew D King;Tilo Ziehn,European heat extremes under net-zero emissions,"Projections of European heat extremes have been widely explored in the context of continued global warming. However, analyses of recent Earth system model simulations point to substantial climatic changes over multi-centennial timescales in net-zero emissions futures. Focusing on Europe, we address the gap in characterising heat extremes in long-term net-zero stabilised climates. We quantify the long-term effects of delayed mitigation on annual maximum daily maximum temperatures (TXx) in European regions using 1000 year-long stabilised simulations with ACCESS-ESM-1.5, reaching net-zero CO2 emissions at different times over the coming decades. We evaluate ACCESS-ESM-1.5 against the ERA5 reanalysis for European maximum temperatures using rank frequency analysis and compare present-day maximum temperatures to their long-term future likelihood. Across all European regions, any delay in achieving net-zero emissions shifts the distribution to higher annual maximum temperatures, remaining elevated at the same levels for centuries. European regions show two- to five-fold frequency increases for heat events as strong as current records, while the Mediterranean region could experience 30-fold increases if emissions cessation is delayed until 2060. When comparing extreme heat distributions at global warming levels, we find substantial differences between transient and net-zero emissions quasi-stable climate states, with larger differences at higher warming levels. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of European extreme hot temperatures in net-zero stabilised climates, paving the way for further investigations of other extreme event types or regions in net-zero futures."

The U.S. National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) institutionalized public engagement in environmental review in the belief it would lead to better decisions and more sustainable outcomes. But, 50 years later, NEPA’s public comment process has been criticized as costly and slow, while doing little to change outcomes. Data science now makes it possible to track progress and evaluate the influence of public participation. We examined 108 environmental impact statement (EIS) processes spanning 22 years. Our analysis revealed that public comments resulted in substantive decision alterations in 62% of cases, with 64% showing modifications to alternatives, 42% showing modifications to mitigation plans and 11% leading to the selection of an entirely new preferred alternative. When federal agencies changed project alternatives (78 EISs), 88% of the time (69 of the 78 EISs) they credited public comments as the reason. In 45 of the 108 EISs, agencies modified mitigation plans and credited public comments as the reason 100% of the time. Agencies only occasionally selected a new preferred alternative (21 out of 104 EISs), but when they did, they credited public comments as the reason 100% of the time. As the United States and the 190+ states and countries that have adopted NEPA’s example consider how to address environmental change, it is important to assess the role of public participation in environmental decision making. Our data say public comments matter."
10.5194/acp-25-5665-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注北京-天津-河北地区气溶胶的光吸收特性模拟，特别是黑碳（BC）的混合状态和老化过程对光吸收的影响。论文通过模拟不同混合状态下PM2.5的吸收系数，发现考虑黑碳的老化过程和涂层厚度后，可以更准确地估算气溶胶的吸收增强效应，从而更好地量化其辐射效应。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为遥感技术可以用于监测气溶胶的浓度、分布和光学特性，从而为空气质量监测和大气成分分析提供数据支持。,"['aerosol light absorption', 'black carbon (BC)', 'mixing state', 'aging process', 'absorption coefficient', 'PM2.5', 'radiative effects', 'Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region', 'air quality']",Huiyun Du;Jie Li;Xueshun Chen;Gabriele Curci;Fangqun Yu;Yele Sun;Xu Dao;Song Guo;Zhe Wang;Wenyi Yang;Lianfang Wei;Zifa Wang,Modeling simulation of aerosol light absorption over the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region: the impact of mixing state and aging processes,"Inadequate consideration of mixing states and coatings on black carbon (BC) hinders aerosol radiation forcing quantification. Core–shell mixing aligns well with observations, but partial internal mixing is a more realistic representation. We used a microphysics module to determine the fraction of embedded BC and coating aerosols, constraining the mixing state. This reduced absorption enhancement by 30 %–43 % in northern China, offering insights into BC's radiative effects. 
 The mixing state and aging characteristics of black carbon (BC) aerosols are the key factors in calculating their optical properties and quantifying their impacts on radiation balance and global climate change. Considerable uncertainty still exists in the absorption properties of BC-containing aerosols and the absorption enhancement (Eabs) due to the lensing effect. It is crucial to reasonably represent the mixing of BC with other aerosol components to reduce this uncertainty. In this study, the absorption properties of PM2.5 were investigated based on the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS) with different assumptions of the aerosol mixing state. The absorption coefficient (babs) is the highest under the assumption of uniform internal mixing, lower under core–shell mixing, and the lowest under external mixing. The result under core–shell mixing is closest to the observations. The aging process and coating thickness were well reproduced by an advanced particle microphysics (APM) module in NAQPMS. Following this, the fraction of embedded BC and secondary component coating on aerosols was used to constrain the mixing state. Eabs at 880 nm over the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region was 2.0–2.5 under core–shell mixing. When the fraction of coated BC and the coating layer are resolved, Eabs_880 – caused by the lensing effect – decreases by 30 %–43 % to 1.2–1.7, which is close to the range reported in previous studies. This study highlights the importance of representing the microphysical processes governing the mixing state and aging of BC and provides a reference for quantifying their radiative effects."
10.5194/amt-18-2439-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文探讨了使用地面傅里叶变换红外光谱仪（FTIR）获取的大气痕量气体反演结果对干涉图长度变化的敏感性。研究表明，低分辨率光谱仪的反演结果更容易受到干涉图截断的影响，这会导致光谱泄漏模式的改变，进而影响痕量气体的反演精度。论文以甲醛为例，展示了干涉图长度变化对反演结果的显著影响，并提出使用适当的窗函数（如Norton-Beer窗函数）可以降低这种敏感性。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是与空气质量监测和大气成分分析有关，因为它直接关注了使用地面遥感技术获取大气成分信息的可靠性和准确性。,"['atmospheric trace gas', 'Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'formaldehyde', 'ground-based remote sensing']",Bavo Langerock;Martine De Mazière;Filip Desmet;Pauli Heikkinen;Rigel Kivi;Mahesh Kumar Sha;Corinne Vigouroux;Minqiang Zhou;Gopala Krishna Darbha;Mohmmed Talib,Robustness of atmospheric trace gas retrievals obtained from low-spectral-resolution Fourier transform infrared absorption spectra under variations of interferogram length,"Ground-based Fourier transform interferometer instruments have been used for many decades to measure direct solar light in the infrared to obtain high-resolution spectra from which atmospheric gas profile concentrations can be derived. It is shown that the typical processing chain used to derive atmospheric gas columns can be sensitive to relatively small shortenings of the recorded interferograms. Low-resolution recordings, used in more recent years, are more sensitive to such adaptations. 
 This study examines the sensitivity of atmospheric trace gas column retrievals from ground-based Fourier transform interferometer measurements to variations in the number of points in the recorded interferograms. Shortening an interferogram can be part of standard FTIR data processing and typically occurs with a convolution operation on the interferogram. Shortening will alter the leakage pattern in the associated spectrum, and we demonstrate that the removal of a relatively small number of  points from the interferogram edges creates a beat pattern in the difference of the associated spectra obtained from the original and shortened interferograms. For low-spectral-resolution interferometers, the beat pattern may exceed the spectral noise level, and, if this occurs, the number of points in the interferogram can become a strong influence parameter for the retrieved trace gas. In a case study with formaldehyde retrievals obtained from low-resolution spectra in Sodankylä and Kolkata, we show that the retrieval software does not accurately model the leakage pattern and that interferogram shortening has a large effect  on atmospheric gas column retrievals that exceeds the estimated retrieval uncertainty of approximately 15 %–30 %. This sensitivity of the retrieval algorithm to the length of the underlying low-resolution interferogram can be reduced by applying a nontrivial apodization such as Norton–Beer apodization. For the Sodankylä case study the correlation between formaldehyde columns obtained from low- and high-resolution measurements increased from 0.72 (without apodization) to 0.93 (Norton–Beer strong apodization)."

We collated fish stomach content data to improve understanding of feeding interactions for the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. To illustrate how these data can be used, we estimate species- and size-specific feeding traits, classify predators into functional feeding groups, and reveal spatially extensive temporal change in marine ecosystem structure and functioning. 
 International efforts to assess the status of marine ecosystems have been hampered by insufficient observations of food web interactions across many species, their various life stages, and their geographic ranges. Hence, we collated data from multiple databases of fish stomach contents from samples taken across the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans containing 944 129 stomach samples from larvae to adults, with 14 196 unique interactions between 227 predator species and 2158 prey taxa. We use these data to develop a reproducible data-driven approach to classifying broad functional feeding guilds and then apply these to fish survey data from the north-east Atlantic shelf seas to reveal spatial and temporal changes in ecosystem structure and functioning. In doing so, we construct individual predator–prey body-mass scaling models to predict the biomass of prey functional groups, e.g. zooplankton, benthos, and fish, for different predator species. These predictions provide empirical estimates of species- and size-specific feeding traits of fish, such as predator–prey mass ratios, individual prey mass, and the biomass contribution of different prey to predator diets. The functional groupings and feeding traits provided here help to further resolve our understanding of interactions within marine food webs and support the use of trait-based indicators in biodiversity assessments.

This model maps water depths with an accuracy of ~1 m. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing global bathymetry models in shallow regions. Our model exhibited superior performance in capturing fine-scale bathymetric features with unprecedented spatial resolution, providing essential data for marine applications. 
 Accurate shallow-water depth information for island areas is crucial for maritime safety, resource exploration, ecological conservation, and offshore economic activity. Traditional approaches such as shipborne sounding and airborne bathymetric light detection and ranging (lidar) surveys are expensive, time-consuming, and constrained in politically sensitive regions. Moreover, satellite-altimetry-predicted depths exhibit large errors over shallow waters. In contrast, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), estimated from multispectral imagery, provides a rapid, open-source, and cost-effective technique for comprehensively characterizing the bathymetry of a region. Given the scarcity of in situ water depth data for the South China Sea (SCS), a shallow-water depth model, HHU24SWDSCS (Hohai University 2024 Shallow-Water Depth Model of South China Sea), was developed using a linear band model by integrating 1298 Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) tracks with 70 Sentinel-2 multispectral images. The model covers over 120 islands and reefs in the SCS region at a resolution of 10 m. Validation against independent ICESat-2 depth data yielded a root mean square error for the model of 0.53–1.24 m (< 5 % of the maximum depth). Further validation using independent airborne lidar bathymetry data in the Lingyang Reef demonstrated an accuracy of 1.01 m. Comparisons with existing bathymetry models revealed the superior performance of the developed model. While traditional bathymetry models exhibit errors of up to tens of meters or larger over island regions and should therefore be used with caution, HHU24SWDSCS demonstrated good accuracy in shallow waters across the SCS. This model thus provides a reference for mapping shallow-water depth close to islands and provides fundamental support for research in oceanography, geodesy, and other disciplines.

10.5194/essd-17-2489-2025,True,Earth System Science Data,该研究建立了一个中国起降周期（LTO）的四维飞机排放清单数据集（2019-2023），考虑了实际运行时间和飞行轨迹。该数据集以高时空分辨率（每小时；0.03° × 0.03° × 34个高度层）反映了飞机排放的独特水平和高度空间特征以及COVID-19对这些排放的影响，为环境分析和政策决策提供了重要信息。该研究重点关注飞机起降过程中的污染物排放，如氮氧化物（NOx）和颗粒物（PM），这些都是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测和大气成分分析，所关注的关键要素。虽然该研究没有直接提及卫星观测或特定的遥感传感器，但其生成的高分辨率排放清单可以作为这些遥感数据的验证和补充，并应用于空气质量模型的输入，从而间接支持了大气环境遥感技术的应用。,"['aircraft emissions', 'air quality', 'LTO cycle', 'NOx', 'PM', 'atmospheric composition']",Jianlei Lang;Zekang Yang;Ying Zhou;Chaoyu Wen;Xiaoqing Cheng,Four-dimensional aircraft emission inventory dataset of the landing-and-takeoff cycle in China (2019–2023),"This study established a four-dimensional (hourly; 0.03° × 0.03° × 34 height layers) aircraft emission inventory dataset in the landing-and-takeoff cycle for China during 2019–2023 considering actual running time and flight trajectory. The dataset reflects unique horizontal and height spatial characteristics and hourly temporal variations of aircraft emissions and the impact of COVID-19 on these emissions, providing essential information for environmental analysis and policy decisions. 
 The rapid growth of the aviation industry has resulted in aircraft emissions during landing and takeoff (LTO), which have direct and increasingly adverse impacts on air quality and human health. An accurate and high-resolution LTO emission inventory is crucial for investigating these adverse effects, with the LTO emission having unique three-dimensional (3D) spatial characteristics and typical hourly temporal variations. This study integrated the emission calculation and flight trajectory recognition methods to establish a four-dimensional (4D) aircraft emission inventory dataset of China's LTO cycle (4D-LTO emission inventory dataset) from 2019 to 2023. The dataset has a high spatial–temporal resolution (hourly, 0.03° × 0.03° × 34 height layers) and incorporates calculation emissions accurately. Moreover, the actual taxi-out/taxi-in time for each flight was determined by a statistical model of taxi time and some aircraft in schedule based on 38 million flights. Each flight's climb/approach time was also obtained based on mixing layer height (MLH) and the height–time nonlinear relationship. Additionally, we calculated the LTO emission for China's flight, establishing the hourly emission inventory based on each mode's running time, emission index, and fuel flow. We obtained the flight trajectory core of each airport based on measured flight trajectories and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to depict the spatial distribution. Then, each flight's takeoff/landing direction and trajectory were identified from the wind direction and relative departure/arrival airport position. The findings indicate that during COVID-19, the LTO number in 2020–2022 was reduced to 73.1 %, 77.6 %, and 48.7 % of 2019 levels, respectively. However, by 2023, the LTO number has rapidly bounced back to 95.3 % of 2019 levels. The recovery rate during daytime (06:00–23:00 UTC+8) was 41.6 % higher than during nighttime (00:00–05:00 UTC+8). The emissions of various pollutants were measured as follows: hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particular matter (PM), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are 3.2, 46.1, 62.3, 1.1, and 18.4 Gg. LTO emissions' horizontal characteristic is the distance along the runway and spread. This elongated distribution will be hidden if a rough grid is used (e.g., 0.36° × 0.36°) and the emissions are evenly distributed. Moreover, LTO emission height characteristic decreases with height, and the maximum height varies with MLH. Emissions above the standard height set by the International Civil Aviation Organization standard height (∼ 915 m) are not estimated. For example, NOx emissions above 915 m during various months make up an average of 24.6 % (9.9 %–37.5 %) in the LTO cycle, indicating the emissions are significantly underestimated when using the ICAO method. Compared with conventional spatial allocation methods, our dataset provides a more accurate representation of the actual LTO situation in both the horizontal direction and height at different times. Our 4D-LTO emission inventory dataset and its adaptable methodology are valuable resources for researching temporal and spatial variations, air quality, and health impacts of aircraft emissions in the LTO cycle.

 Atmospheric inversions are widely used to evaluate and improve inventories of methane (CH4) emissions on scales ranging from global to national and beyond, combining observations with atmospheric transport models. This study uses the dense network of in situ stations of the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) to explore how well in situ data can constrain European CH4 emissions.

 Mountain ecosystems are crucial for global biodiversity conservation and climate regulation, yet their response to environmental change remains poorly understood due to limited high-resolution, multi-element datasets. Here, we present a comprehensive geochemical dataset comprising more than 1,300 soil samples collected from 166 sites across 30 mountain regions in China, spanning five major climatic zones and representative vegetation types. Soil samples were systematically collected from three standardized horizons (organic, surface mineral, and parent material), and analyzed for the concentrations of 24 elements, including macronutrients (e.g., phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium), micronutrients (e.g., iron, molybdenum, manganese, copper), and trace metals (e.g., cadmium, chromium, lead, antimony).

 Forests in Europe are undergoing complex changes that require a comprehensive monitoring of disturbance occurrence. Here, we present the European Forest Disturbance Atlas (EFDA), a Landsat-based approach for mapping annual forest disturbances across continental Europe from 1985 onwards. We built a consistent Landsat data cube of summer composites and compiled reference data on forest land use and forest disturbances. A classification-based approach was developed to detect forest disturbances annually, therefore accounting for multiple disturbance events per time series. The EFDA contains annual layers on disturbance occurrence, severity, and agent, as well as aggregated layers on the number of disturbances and the latest and greatest disturbance year. Based on the annual disturbance estimates (1985–2023), we quantified a total forest disturbed area of 439 000 km2, which increases to 610 000 km2 when accounting for multiple overlapping disturbance events. Map accuracies of the disturbance classification showed an overall F1 score of 0.89, with very low errors (<1 %) for the undisturbed class and with commission and omission errors for the disturbed class of 17.3 % and 22.5 %, respectively. Further, temporal validation revealed that errors decreased over time, with commission errors decreasing substantially to 10.6 % after the year 2000.

Using California as a case study, decarbonization pathways and proposed natural gas plants’ NOx and PM2.5 emissions are modeled, with a statewide target of zero grid-related CO2 emissions by 2046. The plant with the greatest environmental justice impacts is then restricted in the next iteration of capacity expansion modeling; an additional exploratory iteration investigates the impacts of restricting the facility with the greatest health burden per TWh generated. While inequities persist in the second iteration under each constraint, this methodology lays a foundation for applying environmental justice constraints in the development of equitable grid decarbonization pathways and highlights potential paths forward for more effective constraints."

However, the specific roles and mechanisms of phage communities in this process are still not fully understood. In this study, machine learning models were used to explore how micrometer-sized tire crumb rubber (mTCR) affects the transmission of ARGs via phage communities. The results showed that mTCR at environmentally relevant concentrations significantly activated prophages, promoting the spread of the ARGs. The activation mechanisms of shade- and photoaged mTCR differed, with eARGs carried by phage being more abundant in photoaged mTCR-treated sludge despite similar activation efficiencies. The random forests algorithm revealed that prophage activation induced by shade-aged mTCR was primarily driven by the metals and organic components leached from the mTCR. Antibiotic-resistant lysogens tolerated shade-aged mTCR due to their resistance to metals and organic matter, reducing internal prophage activation. In contrast, photoaged mTCR particles harbored more persistent free radicals, leading to the generation of extracellular O2•– and •OH, which damaged cell membranes and triggered prophage activation. These findings highlight the ecological risk associated with eARGs spread via prophage induction and deepen our understanding of the need to control discarded TCR."

We show that reactive bromines like BrCl and Br2 largely diminished after the implementation of the clean energy policy, but high levels of reactive chlorine persisted. A surprising finding in the recent field study is a potentially new chlorine source, likely from chlorine-based fertilizers. Moreover, the changes in aerosol acidity and the NO3 production rate led to a large increase in ClNO2 production with an inhibition of Cl2. The high ClNO2 levels (average: 150 pptv, peak: 3.8 ppbv) accounted for 43% of the oxidation of alkanes, increased conventional radicals (OH, HO2, RO2) by 4–8%, and net ozone production by 8–11%.

We found that Hg0 can be absorbed through both stomata and lipids, with higher Hg concentrations showing a greater tendency to be taken up by lipids. Hg passes through cell membranes via active transport, facilitated by Ca2+ ion channels and water channel proteins. Most Hg (50.1–97.9%) is retained in tissue cells in a low-toxicity and low-activity form (phosphate, pectinate, protein-bound and oxalate), with a small fraction located on leaf surfaces and in cuticular cells.

Under photothermal conditions, the catalyst maintained NOx conversion above 90% at 200 °C, even in the presence of 250 ppm of SO2. Comprehensive characterization revealed that light irradiation significantly enhanced the formation of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface and weakened NO adsorption, indicating that the NH3-SCR reaction follows the Eley–Rideal mechanism, which contributes to its excellent low-temperature activity. Moreover, photothermal conditions reduced the chemical adsorption intensity of SO2, effectively inhibiting the formation of ammonium sulfate. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that the narrow band gap of MoWOx promotes electron transfer from the O 2p orbital to the Ce 4f orbital at the Ce–O–Mo(W) interface under light, leading to electron enrichment at active sites and suppression of SO2 oxidation.

Notably, PFAS enhanced ARGs families (multidrug, aminoglycoside, and glycopeptide) and subtypes (macB, evgS, tetA58, and bcrA), strengthening correlations between the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and antibiotic efflux (R2 = 0.941) or target alteration (R2 = 0.961). Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated by MGEs played a dominant role in ARGs dissemination compared to vertical gene transfer in periphyton communities.

Under low oxidant dosages (e.g., less than ten times the pollutant concentration), the influence of common inorganic anions in wastewater cannot be ignored. However, the respective impacts of ions on the two substrates (i.e., oxidant and pollutant) have not yet been systematically studied yet. In this work, we reveal that several inorganic anions (e.g., NO3–, Cl–, HCO3–, SO42–, HPO42–), which are commonly present in water and wastewater, have much greater influences on the oxidant than on the pollutant, with notable differences among the different ions. The origin of the ion effects was investigated from the aspects of substrate adsorption-activation and interfacial electron transfer. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that the solution resistance, electrostatic interactions, interfacial bonding, and electronic interactions, as well as the ions’ affinity for water, which correlates with the Hofmeister series, were collectively responsible for the ion effects. From a dual-substrate perspective, this work proposes a research paradigm that not only offers insights into the ion effects in heterogeneous chemical water treatment but also holds implications for the design of catalytic active sites and the optimization of reaction conditions in dual-reactant systems."

This study presents compelling evidence of strong convergence of MP at a small-scale surface front near the Eastern Johor Strait (EJS), a typical urbanized coast in Southeast Asia, revealing an estuary tidal intrusion front as a recurrent hotspot that concentrates MP at levels comparable to known estuarine frontal systems. Significantly elevated levels of floating microplastics (150.5 ± 19.8 MP pieces/L) were detected at the surface front compared to other surface water samples along the coast (p < 0.001; 9.2 ± 4.8 MP pieces/L). Hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate that the dynamic interplay between freshwater and seawater are the key mechanisms governing this process. The resulting convergence zones effectively trap buoyant plastics, forming quasi-persistent accumulation zones. Specifically, during ebb tide, parallel outflows from the Johor River and inner EJS amplify frontal convergence, actively trapping floating plastics at the salinity boundary. These findings highlight estuarine surface fronts as influential and previously underquantified systemic pathways influencing MP circulation and retention at marginal seas. Recognizing these traceable accumulation hotspots at ocean boundaries is an urgent priority, offering opportunities for targeted mitigation, particularly in high-leakage regions."

Unexpectedly, urban centers exhibited lower PM2.5 levels than surrounding suburban area. This discrepancy is likely due to combustion-related activities that occur in the suburbs. Such results suggest that air quality mitigation efforts must extend beyond urban centers to suburban areas, where seasonal vegetation loss and combustion processes may drive pollution spikes.

The present study further uncovers a new set of fine structures of magnetosonic waves, namely, each elementary rising‐tone may consist of a series of mini harmonics spaced around the O+ gyrofrequency. The measured ion distributions suggest that the proton ring distribution provides free energy to excite the waves, whilst the O+ ions suppress the wave growth around multiples of O+ gyrofrequency, resulting in the formation of mini harmonics. Further investigation suggests that the warm plasma dispersion relation, that is, the ion Bernstein mode instabilities, may contribute to the formation of mini harmonics.

This study addresses this issue by performing three semi‐idealized large‐eddy simulations. Results indicate that a nascent log layer emerges within the IBL, and its depth gradually increases from ∼60 m near the coast to ∼400 m 12 km inland, where the boundary layer transition is nearly complete. This nascent log layer is superimposed by another log layer originating from the upstream marine boundary layer. While turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is maximized near the surface over both water and land, peak TKE values over land are a factor of 2 greater due to the amplified near‐surface vertical wind shear.

Validation results against in situ data from 240 reservoirs indicate a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.98) and relatively low bias (<10%), therefore demonstrating its robustness across reservoirs of varying sizes and climatic conditions. This method not only captures sub‐weekly surface area changes, but also provides richer temporal information compared to existing monthly data sets.

We compare collocated profiles from multiple STAR‐processed RO missions to ensure the consistency of the data used in the construction of STAR MMC. Because the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate‐2 (COSMIC‐2) contains a noticeable temperature difference compared with other RO missions, we decided not to include it.

Turner;Mathias Vuille;Antoine Rabatel,Constraining Future Projections of Freezing Level Height and Equilibrium‐Line Altitudes in the Tropical Andes Based on CMIP6,"Over the past several decades, glacier retreat in the tropical Andes has accelerated. Given the role glacier melt plays for water supply, ecosystem integrity and glacier‐related natural hazards, improving projections of glacier changes in the region is critical. The accuracy of global climate models in this region remains an issue as the complex terrain and climate characteristics are difficult to realistically simulate. Here, we examine historical changes of freezing level height (FLH) on four tropical Andean glaciers: Antisana 15 glacier in Ecuador, Artesonraju glacier and Quelccaya ice cap in Peru, and Zongo glacier in Bolivia. The changes in FLH at each site are estimated based on ERA5 reanalysis data and then compared with historical simulations from 35 different CMIP6 models. Constraints are then placed on future projections via correction of model bias, selection of “best‐performing” models, and excluding models with an equilibrium climate sensitivity outside the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR6 likely range. By utilizing the significant empirical linear relationship observed between FLH and glacier equilibrium‐line altitude, we estimate the future shrinkage of the glaciers' accumulation zone under two emissions scenarios, SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5. By the year 2100, the Quelccaya ice cap will likely have passed a point of no return, committing to losing its entire accumulation zone, regardless of emission pathway. The same is true for Antisana 15‐alpha glacier under SSP5‐8.5 while a small accumulation zone remains under SSP2‐4.5. Thanks to their higher accumulation area, Zongo and Artesonraju glaciers are more likely to survive beyond 2100, albeit in a strongly reduced extent."

Mapping where gaps in electrification are currently is vital to estimate the unmet energy demand to ensure universal access to electricity and modern fuels. To be informative, mapping of electricity access gaps is needed on a global scale but with spatially‐disaggregated granularity and it is non‐trivial to derive this spatially‐explicit data globally. Satellite observations have the unique vantage point of acquiring global observations with frequent updates and are collected in a standardized manner.

 Plasma membrane integrity is vital for nearly all aspects of cell functioning1. Mechanical forces can cause plasma membrane damage2, but it is not known whether there are large molecules that regulate plasma membrane integrity under mechanical strain. Here we constructed a 384-well cellular stretch system that delivers precise, reproducible strain to cultured cells. Using the system, we screened 10,843 siRNAs targeting 2,726 multi-pass transmembrane proteins for strain-induced membrane permeability changes. The screen identified NINJ1, a protein recently proposed to regulate pyroptosis and other lytic cell death3,4, as the top hit. We demonstrate that NINJ1 is a critical regulator for mechanical strain-induced plasma membrane rupture (PMR), without the need of stimulating any cell death programs. NINJ1 level on the plasma membrane is inversely correlated to the amount of force required to rupture the membrane. In the pyroptosis context, NINJ1 on its own is not sufficient to fully rupture the membrane, and additional mechanical force is required for full PMR. Our work establishes that NINJ1 functions as a bona fide determinant of membrane biomechanical properties. Our study also suggests that PMR across tissues of distinct mechanical microenvironments is subjected to fine tuning by differences in NINJ1 expression and external forces."

 Differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into specialized cell types is essential for uncovering cell-type specific molecular mechanisms and interrogating cellular function. Transcription factor screens have enabled efficient production of a few cell types; however, engineering cell types that require complex transcription factor combinations remains challenging. Here, we report an iterative, high-throughput single-cell transcription factor screening method that enables the identification of transcription factor combinations for specialized cell differentiation, which we validated by differentiating human microglia-like cells. We found that the expression of six transcription factors, SPI1, CEBPA, FLI1, MEF2C, CEBPB, and IRF8, is sufficient to differentiate human iPSC into cells with transcriptional and functional similarity to primary human microglia within 4 days. Through this screening method, we also describe a novel computational method allowing the exploration of single-cell RNA sequencing data derived from transcription factor perturbation assays to construct causal gene regulatory networks for future cell fate engineering.

In this article, the authors show that precise retinoic acid degradation is critical for instructing regeneration of the appropriate limb segment. 
 Regenerating limbs retain their proximodistal (PD) positional identity following amputation. This positional identity is genetically encoded by PD patterning genes that instruct blastema cells to regenerate the appropriate PD limb segment. Retinoic acid (RA) is known to specify proximal limb identity, but how RA signaling levels are established in the blastema is unknown. Here, we show that RA breakdown via CYP26B1 is essential for determining RA signaling levels within blastemas. CYP26B1 inhibition molecularly reprograms distal blastemas into a more proximal identity, phenocopying the effects of administering excess RA. We identify Shox as an RA-responsive gene that is differentially expressed between proximally and distally amputated limbs. Ablation of Shox results in shortened limbs with proximal skeletal elements that fail to initiate endochondral ossification. These results suggest that PD positional identity is determined by RA degradation and RA-responsive genes that regulate PD skeletal element formation during limb regeneration.

Here, the authors show polystyrene nanoplastics disrupt intestinal integrity and gut microbiota composition by altering microRNA expression in extracellular vesicles, highlight a potential pathway through which nanoplastic exposure affects gut health. 
 Nanoplastics (NP) are emerging environmental pollutants with potential risks to human health. This study investigates how polystyrene-NP exposure disrupts the intestinal microenvironment and barrier function through bacteria-host interactions. Using in vivo models and bacterial sorting technology, we show that NP accumulation in the mouse intestine alters the expression of intestinal miR-501-3p and miR-700-5p, compromising tight junction protein ZO-1 and mucin (MUC)−13 expression, thereby increasing intestinal permeability. NP increases miR-98-3p, miR-548z, miR-548h-3o, miR-548d-3p, miR-548az-5p, miR-12136, and miR-101-3p levels in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from goblet-like cells, which can interfere with ZO-1 expression. NP also induces gut microbiota dysbiosis, characterized by elevated Ruminococcaceae abundance and altered EV characteristics from goblet cells. Lachnospiraceae internalize NP, and their EVs suppress MUC-13 expression. These findings reveal a mechanism by which NP compromises intestinal integrity and indirectly alters intestinal microbiota composition, potentially leading to adverse health outcomes.

 Relativistic jets from accreting black holes radiate non-thermal emission which is highly variable in different time scales. Previous studies on black holes of different mass scales, including supermassive and stellar-mass black holes, only report flux quasi-periodic oscillations in radio, optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands. No quasi-periodic variations in polarization have yet been detected in any black hole systems. Here, we report a detection of GHz-band radio polarization oscillations in GRS 1915+105, which harbors a fast-spinning stellar-mass black hole with a relativistic jet. Our observations show that during the increasing phase of radio emission, linear polarization and flux exhibit similar oscillation periods of 17 and 33 seconds, and their variation patterns anti-correlate with each other. These rare, short-period oscillations in both polarization and flux would be important to understand instabilities and special dynamics in magnetized relativistic jets.

 Climate change assessments (CCAs) play a critical role in taking stock of the available science and other forms of knowledge and informing policy processes. As the underlying evidence base increases exponentially, the complexity also increases and challenges CCA author teams to capture all the relevant knowledge. Therefore, CCAs will need to transition from predominantly assessing primary research to focusing on the assessment and critical appraisal of knowledge syntheses of such work, alongside capturing knowledges held outside traditional scientific sources. To support this, a stronger knowledge synthesis culture is needed, and we propose key recommendations and offer guidance for producing robust, transparent, reproducible, inclusive and timely syntheses that can inform CCAs across scales.

 Atlantic Niño can influence ENSO by modulating the Pacific Walker circulation. This interbasin connection is dominated by central Atlantic Niño (CAN) events, which began to emerge around 2000. Our analysis of observational data and climate model simulations reveals that the influence of CAN on ENSO will strengthen in a warming climate due to an enhanced Pacific response. On one hand, increased variability of the eastern Pacific intertropical convergence zone leads to stronger subsidence anomalies induced by CAN; on the other hand, strengthened atmospheric variability over the North Indian Ocean enhances the region’s response to CAN-induced Kelvin waves, promoting easterly anomalies over the western tropical Pacific. These changes are further linked to the pronounced interhemispheric warming contrast projected by climate models. Our findings underscore the growing influence of Atlantic Niño on ENSO, with important implications for seasonal climate prediction and future climate change projections."

 Consecutive heatwave and heavy rainfall (HW‐HR) events are occurring with increasing frequency in a warming climate. The time interval, defined as the duration between the end of a heatwave and the onset of heavy rainfall, affects both environmental conditions and the regional recovery between two consecutive extreme events. However, the dynamics of the transition between consecutive HW-HR events remain poorly understood. In this study, we examine the changes in the time interval of consecutive HW-HR events in China from 1970 to 2019, using meteorological data from over 2000 stations across mainland China. Our results reveal that the time interval has significantly shortened at 24.1% of the stations. This trend is primarily driven by an increased proportion of short-time events (STEs), defined as consecutive events with time intervals within 1–2 days. From 1970 to 2019, the proportion of STEs increased significantly, at a rate of 1.4% per decade. We also find that climate change-induced anomalies in atmospheric variables during the consecutive HW-HR events, especially convective available potential energy, 2 m temperature, and relative humidity, may contribute to this rise in the proportion of STEs. Additionally, our study assesses changes in population exposure to STEs over the past two decades. We find that the area of exposure has increased across more than three-quarters of the country, with the increases in STEs contributing to 65.3% of the overall rise in exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of prioritizing disaster response during consecutive HW-HR events and implementing effective risk management strategies to mitigate population exposure to extreme events."

 The presence and stability of brines on Mars’s surface remain a significant mystery in planetary exploration. Previous mechanisms proposed for brine formation include melting of ice-salt mixtures and salt deliquescence. However, melting lacks a recharge mechanism, and deliquescence is impeded by Mars’s extreme surface aridity. This study explores an underexplored process: the role of seasonal frost in brine formation. Utilizing meteorological data from the Viking 2 lander—the only mission, with Phoenix, to observe in situ water frost formation—I demonstrate that brines can form over approximately 30 sols at the end of winter as frost sublimates. The stable brines exhibit a water activity upper limit of 0.52, corresponding to the eutectic point of calcium perchlorate, a salt detected in various Martian regions, likely including the Viking 2 landing site. Consequently, I conclude that calcium perchlorate can generate small amounts of liquid brine in contact with frost for brief periods. The seasonal nature of frost suggests these brines recur and may leave long-term imprints. Therefore, frost-covered regions are prime candidates for future habitability and astrobiological exploration.

 Emperor penguin populations are predicted to decline rapidly over the current century owing to habitat loss in Antarctica arising from warming oceans and loss of seasonal sea ice. Previous work using very high-resolution satellite imagery from 2009 to 2018 revealed a population decrease of 9.5%, characterized by a continuous decline until 2016, with a slight recovery until 2018. Our study, for the sector 0° to 90°W, includes the recent period of sea-ice loss between 2020 and 2023 and provides a regional population update for around a third of the global population. We used supervised classification of very high-resolution imagery, linked to a Markov model and Bayesian statistics. Results indicate a significant reduction in emperor penguin numbers, variance in the methodology is relatively high, but provides a best fit estimate of 22% decline over the period equating to a reduction of 1.6% per year. This decline exceeds the predictions of demographic models based on high-emission scenarios. It is unclear whether the sector analyzed here reflects conditions around the entire continent and our results highlight the need to extend the analysis to all sectors of Antarctica to determine whether these trends are reflected elsewhere.

 Over recent decades, changes in atmospheric ozone and climate have substantially altered surface solar ultraviolet radiation, but the impacts of these changes on crop yields remain unclear. Here we analyze climate data and maize yields from 1992 to 2018 across China to quantify how extreme ultraviolet radiation events—periods of exceptionally high ultraviolet exposure—affect maize production. We show that maize yields decline by about 0.72% for each 1% increase in these events, especially during critical mid-growing stages, although higher soil moisture can reduce this damage. By the 2030 s, extreme ultraviolet radiation could reduce yields by 1.4% and 2.17%, with losses increasing substantially under moderate dry (by 51%) and severe heat stress (by 124%). These findings underscore the necessity of accounting for changes in ultraviolet radiation to improve the accuracy of yield projections.

This suggests the 2020–2022 growth in methane is best explained by other methane source or sink mechanisms, or that non-hydrological controls are more important in tropical wetland methane emissions than currently understood. The strong increase in global methane from 2020-2022 was not powered by precipitation and inundation increasing wetland emissions in tropical regions, according to analysis of satellite observations of tropical inundation, 2018-2023."

 Enhancing sustainable rice production is crucial for global food security. Here we demonstrate that 0.1 mg kg‒1selenium-engineered nanomaterials promote rice (Oryza sativa L.) tillering and yield by optimizing the rhizosphere microbial community, improving nitrogen use efficiency, and modulating plant hormones and growth-related genes. Using pot experiments with five different soils and field trials in China, we found that soil organic carbon strongly influences nanomaterial effectiveness. Field results demonstrated a 10.7% yield increase and a 309.8% rise in grain selenium concentration, with no adverse effects on soil quality. Predictive modeling calculated that selenium-enhanced agriculture could increase profits by +$231.5 ha−1, reduce CO2 emissions by 1.12 Tons ha−1, and produce selenium-rich grains ( ~ 20 μg·100 g−1) to address dietary deficiencies. Our findings highlight the potential of selenium nanomaterials to sustainably boost rice production, urging further research across diverse ecosystems to optimize their agricultural and environmental benefits.

 Soil moisture (SM) is a critical variable in land-atmosphere interactions. As an important passive microwave remote sensing dataset, the Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) SM has been applied in a variety of scientific studies and applications. However, due to the discontinuous coverage of satellite revisit orbits, the FY-3B SM contains a large range of data gaps, which greatly limit the applicability. To solve this problem, we proposed a one-dimensional deep learning network-based time series reconstruction model called TTP (Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-Transformer Parallel) model, which makes full use of the TCN to capture short-term dynamic changes and the Transformer to obtain long-term dependencies, thus, extracting local and global features of the one-dimensional time series simultaneously. Based on the proposed TTP model, a global, daily, spatially seamless FY-3B SM dataset from 12 July 2011 to 19 August 2019 was generated. The performance of TTP was examined using two types of experiments: 1) in-situ data validation (the in-situ data at the same location were served as the reference); 2) original FY-3B SM validation (gaps were simulated by randomly masking the observations, with the original FY-3B SM as the reference). The TTP-based global, daily, spatially seamless dataset presents great consistency with the in-situ data, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0900 m3/m3. Additionally, the reconstructed FY-3B SM based on TTP is consistently more accurate than four benchmarks (i.e., the self-supervised learning for interpolation (SSLI), the multivariate time series imputation method (MITST), the ModernTCN, and the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS)). Moreover, the reconstructed FY-3B SM demonstrates reliable accuracy across various missing data simulated with different proportions and continuous lengths. The TTP can provide methodological support for large-scale remote sensing data reconstruction, and the generated dataset can provide data support for research in fields such as soil science and hydrology. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27957429.v45."

 Atmospheric concentrations and formation mechanisms of particulate nitrosamines and nitramines were investigated in Seoul, South Korea during spring 2019. The total concentration of seven particulate nitrosamines was 17.51 ± 16.74 ng/m3, with nitroso-dibutylamine (NDBA, 7.86 ± 8.59 ng/m3) being the predominant species, while the sum of two nitramines was 0.70 ± 0.52 ng/m3. Correlation analysis showed that nitro(so) compounds were correlated with both primary emission markers (CO, PAHs) and factors associated with secondary formation (the ratio of total nitroso compounds to PM2.5, and liquid water content). Box model simulations estimated that atmospheric reactions contributed 24.4 ± 25.2 % and 55.4 ± 27.0 % to particulate N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrodimethylamine (DMN) formation, respectively. Multilinear regression analysis identified ozone as the strongest predictor for both measured NDMA (β = 1.035, p < 0.01) and DMN (β = 0.893, p < 0.05) concentrations, although this correlation likely reflects the non-linear relationship between NOx and O3 due to O3 titration in NOx-saturated conditions rather than direct ozonation effects. Sensitivity analyses revealed that both compounds responded positively to NO2 increases through enhanced N2O3 and N2O4 formation, while NO increases showed differential effects: promoting NDMA formation while having minimal impact on DMN concentrations due to their distinct formation pathways. These findings demonstrate the complex atmospheric chemistry of nitro(so) compounds in urban environments and highlight the importance of NOx chemistry in their formation."

 In recent studies available in literature, long-range transport was suggested to play a main role in the motion of microplastics in the free atmosphere, whereas emission sources are located in the planetary boundary layer. In this framework, the Lagrangian particle dispersion model MILORD was used both in forward and in backward modes to investigate the potential effectiveness of the transport and exchange of microplastics between the boundary layer and the free atmosphere. Two pioneering case studies from the literature were considered. The first where microplastics were detected in the free atmosphere above Madrid region, the second where microplastics were collected in the air at the top-mountain site of Pic Du Midi in the French Pyrenees. The simulations showed that the long-range transport plays the main role in determining the presence of microplastics in the free atmosphere above Madrid, while the emissions from the city affect mostly the air in the boundary layer, at regional scale in the surrounding area. The long-range transport towards Pic Du Midi site pointed out also potential contributions connected to the exchange between the marine environments and the atmosphere and to possible dust events from North Africa."

 The heterogeneous reaction of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is an important pathway for the nighttime formation of nitrate and its parameterization especially in the presence of organic coatings (considering phase changes) is complicated. In this study, an updated combination of inorganic core (Davis08) - organic shell (Gaston14 and Riemer09) parameterization schemes for N2O5 hydrolysis was embedded into the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry to discuss the simulated differences of and organic coating impacts on size-resolved N2O5 uptake coefficients and nitrate in North China, which have not been reported. All the three size-resolved N2O5 uptake coefficients had significant spatiotemporal variations, with a largest value in size bin 2 (156–625 nm). The values in the eastern coastal and relatively clean areas were generally larger than those in inland and polluted areas due to variations of relative humidity (RH), and were suppressed in nitrate dominated areas. Scheme Riemer09 is related to the thickness of SOA (secondary organic aerosol) package (l/Rp) and produced at least 2 μg/m3 of nitrate inhibition in regions where l/Rp ≥ 0.08 fit γD (the uptake coefficient of inorganic core) ≥ 1 × 10−2. Scheme Gaston14 considers the effects of ambient RH and SOA phase; in those areas where RH was greater than 70 %, the coating effect simulated by scheme Gaston14 was relatively small; when low RH (<40 %) and low O:C ratios (<0.48) coexisted, scheme Gaston14 had a significant coating effect, leading to its simulated nitrate being ∼4 μg/m3 lower than the simulation of scheme Riemer09. The two coating schemes showed a similar vertical trend, with a maximum difference of 15 % of the heterogeneous produced nitrate in size bin 2 in the polluted areas at the height of ∼240m. Scheme Gaston14 exhibited greater advantages under complex meteorological and aerosol conditions."

 The seasonal cycle of precipitation in South America (SA) peaks in intensity during austral summer (DJF), contributing up to 80% of the total annual rainfall. This seasonality is influenced by variability at different time-scales. At the subseasonal range, there is a lack of understanding of the mechanisms controlling high-frequency transients (8–20 days) of precipitation, which accounts for ∼60% of the total DJF subseasonal variance. Our results show that the observed high-frequency variability features a dipole pattern in SA, whose phase is controlled by the complex interplay between upper-tropospheric Rossby waves, remotely triggered by variability in the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) convective activity, and regional low-tropospheric moisture transport and topography. The nature of the remotely-generated signal is further identified in sensitivity experiments with a Linear Baroclinic Model. Our results indicate that this teleconnection pattern can be used as a potential tool for subseasonal precipitation predictability, and that addressing model biases in simulating the spatio-temporal characteristics of SPCZ precipitation is important for near-hemispheric climate projections."

 This study investigates the effects of sea surface temperature (SST) updating strategy in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model during a heatwave event over the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea in July 2019. The MM5 revised Surface Layer and Yonsei University Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) schemes were used and wind field at 10 m, air potential temperature, surface fluxes, and planetary boundary layer height were examined. Generally, the greatest impacts over the sea were observed within 20 km of the shoreline. We found an underestimation of the modeled SST in non-updated SST simulations during the heatwave episode that was propagated into the atmosphere, leading to a cold bias of 2-m potential temperature up to 2.5 K onshore. In heatwave conditions the most common surface layer stability class was very unstable, and its frequency increased when the SST was updated, particularly near the coast, revealing that SST updating leads to greater dominance of thermal turbulent mixing of surface fluxes in the heatwave period studied. Sensible and latent heat fluxes across stability regimes were analyzed, and latent heat flux showed greater sensitivity to SST updating and the highest magnitudes. However, PBL height variations between SST-updated and non-updated simulations presented a greater sensitivity to sensible heat flux. On average, during the heatwave period, the planetary boundary layer height in simulations with updated SST increased by 75 m onshore, compared to a smaller increase of 26 m offshore, which highlights the greater sensitivity in the onshore region and their impact on vertical modeled profiles. These results emphasize the importance of an accurate representation of boundary layer conditions on numerical weather prediction models, as well as illustrating the nonlinear behavior on the surface layer and PBL scheme, particularly important under heatwaves."
