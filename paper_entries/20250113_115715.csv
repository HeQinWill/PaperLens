The persistence and prevalence of heterocyclic compounds in soil pose significant risks to soil health. However, understanding the links between heterocyclic compounds and microbial responses remains challenging due to the complexity of microbial communities and their various chemical structures. This study developed a machine-learning approach that integrates the properties of chemical structures with the diversity of soil bacteria and functions to predict the impact of heterocyclic compounds on the microbial community and improve the design of eco-friendly heterocyclic compounds. We screened the key chemical structures of heterocyclic compounds─particularly those with topological polar surface areas (<74.2 Å2 or 111.3–154.1 Å2), carboxyl groups, and dissociation constant, which maintained high soil bacterial diversity and functions, revealing threshold effects where specific structural parameters dictated microbial responses. These eco-friendly compounds stabilize communities and increase beneficial carbon and nitrogen cycle functions. By applying these design parameters, we quantitatively assessed the eco-friendliness scores of 811 heterocyclic compounds, providing a robust foundation for guiding future applications. Our study disentangles the critical chemical structure-related properties that influence the soil microbial community and establishes a computational framework for designing eco-friendly compounds with ecological benefits from an ecological perspective."

H. Tian;Z. Wang;H. S. Fu;Z. Z. Guo,Evidence of a Magnetic Null in Electron‐Only Reconnection,"Magnetic nulls are traditionally suggested as main points where energy dissipation occurs during reconnection. Such nulls have been widely observed in the diffusion region of standard reconnection following a two‐fluid picture, but have never been investigated in the thin current sheet of electron‐only reconnection. Recently, an electron‐only reconnection event was observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission in Earth's magnetosheath. The small separation of MMS spacecraft (∼7 km) provides a good opportunity to examine whether magnetic nulls exist in electron‐only reconnection. By utilizing the First‐Order Taylor Expansion method, we find a radial null in this event. Moreover, such nulls degenerate into X‐type nulls inside a reconnecting current sheet, suggesting that it's quasi 2D structure. By reconstructing the topology of this null, we can also estimate the reconnection rate of this electron‐only reconnection event and find it's time‐varying, suggesting it's an unsteady process. Our results are useful to further understand the process of electron‐only reconnection."

This study has explored the changing relationship between EHHE in eastern China and tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Results show that the monopolar mode of EHHE is significantly associated with spring SST anomalies in Northwest Pacific (NWP) before the mid‐1990s, which can impact humid‐heat conditions in eastern China through an atmospheric meridional overturning circulation extending from NWP to eastern China. Then, the associated eastward shift of convection center after the mid‐1990s weakens connection between NWP SST anomalies and the monopolar mode. Further analysis reveals that the weakened Kelvin waves, induced by persistent SST anomalies from spring in tropical Indian Ocean after the mid‐1990s, cause the westward‐shifted anomalous convection in western Pacific, and then reinforce formation of the dipolar mode via exciting zonal wave trains. Numerical simulations via linear baroclinic model further validate atmospheric response to displacement of diabatic forcings."

The influence of wind‐ice‐ocean interactions on microseism has been taken into account.

We further assess model performance to determine a representative region over which sea‐ice concentration and ocean‐wave activity most directly influence the microseism power. The seismological methods developed here suggest that there is the potential to augment or refine observations of sea‐ice conditions obtained from satellites and from in‐situ observations. Seismological methods may thus help determine properties such as sea‐ice thickness, which are less amenable to conventional observations, under a changing climate, particularly in remote areas like the High Arctic."

Van de Koot;Aiko Voigt",The Cloud Radiative Response to Surface Warming Weakens Hydrological Sensitivity,"Precipitation is expected to increase in a warmer global climate, yet how sensitive precipitation is to warming depends on poorly constrained cloud radiative processes. Clouds respond to surface warming in ways that alter the atmosphere's ability to radiatively cool and hence form precipitation. Here we examine the links between cloud responses to warming, atmospheric radiative fluxes, and hydrological sensitivity in AMIP6 simulations. The clearest impacts come from high clouds, which reduce atmospheric radiative cooling as they rise in altitude in response to surface warming. Using cloud locking, we demonstrate that high cloud radiative changes weaken Earth's hydrological sensitivity to surface warming. The total impact of cloud radiative effects on hydrological sensitivity is halved by interactions between cloud and clear‐sky radiative effects, yet is sufficiently large to be a major source of uncertainty in hydrological sensitivity."

Our findings indicate that the reconnection rate decreases during the instability growth phase, especially at locations where the current sheet undergoes significant perturbations.

These simulations cover 10‐year time slices and were obtained by downscaling global climate model (GCM) projections, using regional climate models (RCMs) and kilometer‐scale convection‐permitting models (CPMs). Our analysis over the Alpine area agrees with previous studies in terms of projected summer precipitation changes for the end of the century, in particular regarding a decrease in mean precipitation and increases in hourly precipitation intensities. In addition, we assess projected changes over different subregions, provide analyses at monthly and seasonal basis for temporal aggregations ranging from 1 hr to 5 days, address different extreme precipitation indices, and present validation against an Alpine‐scale daily precipitation data set and an hourly precipitation product based on 3 Doppler radars. The evaluation reveals that CPMs show a refinement of spatial patterns, reduce the overestimation of precipitation frequency, and better capture intense precipitation characteristics. The improvements are especially apparent on the sub‐daily scale and in the summer season. Convection‐Permitting Model climate projections show an increase in precipitation intensity for all seasons and across all temporal aggregations in all regions, except for the Mediterranean in summer. The projections from different CPMs qualitatively agree, despite significant differences in the GCMs circulation changes, suggesting that the increase in heavy events is primarily due to thermodynamic effects. We also present a hypothesis explaining why projections of relative changes in hourly precipitation percentiles are similar between CPMs and RCMs, despite large biases in RCMs."

Ramsey;Daniel R. Kollath;Anita J. Antoninka;Bridget M. Barker,"Proposed Relationships Between Climate, Biological Soil Crusts, Human Health, and in Arid Ecosystems","Biological soil crusts (or biocrust) are diminutive soil communities with ecological functions disproportionate to their size. These communities are composed of lichens, bryophytes, cyanobacteria, fungi, liverworts, and other microorganisms. Creating stabilizing matrices, these microorganisms interact with soil surface minerals thereby enhancing soil quality by redistributing nutrients and reducing erosion by containment of soil particles. Climatic stressors and anthropogenic disturbances reduce the cover, abundance, and functions of these communities leading to an increase of aeolian dust, invasive plant establishment, reduction of water retention in the environment, and overall poor soil condition. Drylands are the most degraded terrestrial ecosystems on the globe and support a disproportionately large human population. Restoration of biocrust communities in semi‐arid and arid ecosystems benefits ecosystem health while decreasing dust emissions. Dust abatement can improve human health directly but also indirectly by reducing pathogenic microbe load circulating in the ambient air. We hypothesize that biocrusts not only reduce pathogen load in the air column but also inhibit the proliferation of certain pathogenic microbes in the soil. We provide a review of mechanisms by which healthy biocrusts in dryland systems may reduce soil‐borne pathogens that impact human health. Ecologically sustainable mitigation strategies of biocrust restoration will not only improve soil conditions but could also reduce human exposure to soil‐borne pathogens."

 Immunotherapy is improving the survival of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet reliable biomarkers are needed to identify responders prospectively and optimize patient care. In this study, we explore the benefits of multimodal approaches to predict immunotherapy outcome using multiple machine learning algorithms and integration strategies. We analyze baseline multimodal data from a cohort of 317 metastatic NSCLC patients treated with first-line immunotherapy, including positron emission tomography images, digitized pathological slides, bulk transcriptomic profiles, and clinical information. Testing multiple integration strategies, most of them yield multimodal models surpassing both the best unimodal models and established univariate biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression. Additionally, several multimodal combinations demonstrate improved patient risk stratification compared to models built with routine clinical features only. Our study thus provides evidence of the superiority of multimodal over unimodal approaches, advocating for the collection of large multimodal NSCLC datasets to develop and validate robust and powerful immunotherapy biomarkers.

 People living with HIV are at higher risk of heart failure and associated left atrial remodeling compared to people without HIV. Mechanisms are unclear but have been linked to inflammation and premature aging. Here we obtain plasma proteomics concurrently with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in two independent study populations to identify parallels between HIV-related and aging-related immune dysfunction that could contribute to atrial remodeling and clinical heart failure. We discover a plasma proteomic signature that may in part reflect or contribute to HIV-associated atrial remodeling, many features of which are associated with older age and time to incident heart failure among an independent community-based cohort without HIV. This proteomic profile was statistically enriched for immune checkpoint proteins, tumor necrosis factor signaling, ephrin signaling, and extracellular matrix organization, identifying possible shared pathways in HIV and aging that may contribute to risk of heart failure.

 Cheek swabs, heterogeneous samples consisting primarily of buccal epithelial cells, are widely used in pediatric DNA methylation studies and biomarker creation. However, the decrease in buccal proportion with age in adults remains unexamined in childhood. We analyzed cheek swabs from 4626 typically developing children 2-months to 20-years-old. Estimated buccal proportion declined throughout childhood with both increasing chronological and predicted epigenetic age. However, buccal proportion did not associate with age throughout adolescence. Variability in buccal proportion increased with age through the entire developmental range. These trends held inversely true for neutrophil proportions. Correcting for buccal proportion attenuated the weak association with PedBE age acceleration to non-significance during initial estimation. Notably, correcting for buccal proportion attenuated the association of PedBE age acceleration with obsessive-compulsive disorder and strengthened the association with diurnal cortisol slope. Thus, the age-related change in children’s oral cells is a crucial consideration for cell type-sensitive research.

 Precise temporal control of sensorimotor coordination and adaptation is a fundamental basis of animal behavior. How different brain regions are involved in regulating the flexible temporal adaptation remains elusive. Here, we investigated the neuronal dynamics of the cerebellar interposed nucleus (IpN) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons during temporal adaptation between delay eyeblink conditioning (DEC) and trace eyeblink conditioning (TEC). When mice were trained for either DEC or TEC and subsequently subjected to a new paradigm, their conditioned responses (CRs) adapted virtually instantaneously. Changes in the activity of the IpN neurons related to CR timing were prominent during DEC-to-TEC adaptation, but less so during TEC-to-DEC adaptation. In contrast, mPFC neurons could rapidly alter their modulation patterns during both adaptation paradigms. Accordingly, silencing the mPFC completely blocked the adaptation of CR timing. These results illustrate how cerebral and cerebellar mechanisms may play different roles during adaptive control of associative motor timing. Precise adaptation of motor timing is vital in sensorimotor coordination.

Here, the authors show that while exercise prevented weight gain in mice, it surprisingly worsened heart damage due to excessive lipid uptake and lipotoxicity. 
 Physical exercise is a cornerstone for preventing diet-induced obesity, while it is unclear whether physical exercise could offset high-fat, high-calories diet (HFCD)-induced cardiac dysfunction. Here, mice were fed with HFCD and simultaneously subjected to physical exercise. As expected, physical exercise prevented HFCD-induced whole-body fat deposition. However, physical exercise exacerbated HFCD-induced cardiac damage. Further metabolomic analysis results showed that physical exercise induced circulating lipid redistribution, leading to excessive cardiac lipid uptake and lipotoxicity. Our study provides valuable insights into the cardiac effects of exercise in mice fed with HFCD, suggesting that counteracting the negative effect of HFCD by simultaneous physical exercise might be detrimental. Moreover, inappropriate physical exercise may damage certain organs even though it leads to weight loss and overall metabolic benefits. Of note, the current findings are based on animal experiments, the generalizability of these findings beyond this specific diet and mouse strain remains to be further explored.

 Timely and accurate crop mapping is essential for predicting crop production, estimating water use, and informing market forecasts. However, operational crop maps are typically accessible more than four months subsequent to harvest, rather than in real-time or near real-time (NRT). Recently, in-season crop mapping has emerged by leveraging rich satellite data sources at various scales in the United States (US) Corn Belt – a prominent food-producing agricultural region dominated by corn and soybeans. However, challenges persist due to inadequate clear-sky satellite observations and the absence of field-scale in-season crop phenometrics. Recognizing that SWIR (shortwave infrared reflectance) is able to reflect the asynchronous temporal variations in plant canopy water contents and that combining phenological shift and growth magnitude can enhance the classification of crop types, this study developed two canopy Greenness and Water (GW) content indices that are GW-I, which is a ratio of the kernel NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) to SWIR to distinguish phenological shift of different crops, and GW-II, which is a product of kernel NDVI and SWIR to separate growth magnitude of different crops. To reconstruct gap-free field-scale GW-I and GW-II time series, historical and timely available multi-scale satellite observations, including Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), are dynamically fused every week. The potential future GW-I and GW-II values are further predicted using a recently developed algorithm of Spatiotemporal Shape Matching Model (SSMM) and combined with the timely available time series for retrieving NRT phenometrics (greenup onset, mid-date of greenup phase, and maturity onset) every week during the crop greenup phase. Multiple Gaussian mixture models are used to independently estimate the weekly probability of corn and soybean types using three NRT crop phenometrics and the latest (≤3 days' latency) GW-II. Finally, the corn and soybean probabilities (estimated from GW-I phenometrics and GW-II crop growth magnitude together) are integrated to produce NRT corn and soybean mapping every week during the early growing season. The accuracy of NRT corn and soybean mapping is evaluated using the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). The result shows that our method can map corn and soybean in diverse croplands across the US Corn Belt with an overall accuracy of ∼90 % at a relatively early date (late July), although the local heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes potentially impacts the accuracy during the early stages. These findings underscore the feasibility of applying the developed method to produce near real-time corn and soybean mapping not only across the US Corn Belt but also in other countries and diverse agricultural regions."

 Mid-latitude stratus clouds with large spatial extent are important cooling engines in a warming world, while other types of clouds may accelerate warming. However, our understanding of cloud feedback in a changing climate remains incomplete in both space and time. A key factor contributing to this knowledge gap is the lack of long-term observations with spatio-temporally continuous information over large areas. Satellite data from the geostationary orbit could help in this regard, but they were never originally intended for climatological studies and, as a result, provide inconsistent data between individual satellites of different satellite generations. However, for investigations on a time scale of 30 years and more, a homogeneous dataset of gross cloud occurrence is essential to assess changes in cloud cover over the last decades. In addition, such a dataset is the basis for further analyzing long-term changes in other cloud types such as fog and low stratus (FLS). The generation of temporally homogeneous cloud information over Europe requires a dataset that is consistent in space and time. The current study develops a new cloud detection scheme based on harmonized radiances obtained by cross-calibrating Meteosat First (MFG) MVIRI (Meteosat Visible Infra-Red Imager) and Second Generation (MSG) SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager) data. The harmonized data set consists of two MFG bands (thermal infrared IR and water vapour WV), which guarantee long-term (1991–2020) availability over the full diurnal cycle (24 h). The new cloud classification scheme is based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and uses the two MFG channels as primary predictors or features. While cloud detection using only two MFG channels is a challenging task, additional features such as temporal trends in brightness temperature (BT), its spatial heterogeneity, clear sky reference BTs, topographic variables, and solar and satellite angles are also considered in the XGBoost model. The EUMETSAT CM SAF SEVIRI cloud mask based on MSG SEVIRI is used in part as the binary target variable to train the XGBoost model (cloudy/clear-sky) and as a benchmark to test the performance of the newly developed cloud detection scheme. Test results show very good agreement with the benchmark CM SAF SEVIRI cloud mask, with an average Heidke Skill Score (HSS) of 0.83 for day-time and 0.8 for night-time cloud occurrence. Further testing shows that the new cloud mask clearly outperforms the existing EUMETSAT Optimal Cloud Analysis (OCA) dataset based on MSG visible and IR 10.8 μm channels. In particular, the FLS detection in our cloud mask was found to be superior to the OCA during night and boreal winter. Based on the trend analysis of the generated time series of cloud frequencies, we found a general decrease in cloudiness over the last 30 years in many parts of Europe."

 Pandemic outbreaks significantly disrupt human work activity, which is a crucial aspect of urban daily life, potentially causing reduced income or unemployment. These disruptions often vary across different population groups and regions. However, most existing studies focus on general human mobility patterns with limited attention specific to work activity, and conduct separate analyses on population groups and regions, overlooking intra-population differences across regions and inter-population variations within the same region. To this end, we first introduce the concept of work intensity to quantify the work activity. Using large-scale mobile phone data, we then estimate an individual’s work intensity, and characterize the changes in work intensity based on the concept of resilience, i.e., the ability to withstand and recover from a disaster. Finally, we propose a novel analytical framework that integrates both population groups and regions to assess differences in resilience. Herein, we take the pandemic outbreak in Beijing after the sudden relaxation of dynamic zero-COVID policy as a case study due to less policy intervention. Results reveal that females and younger people exhibit lower work intensity resilience, respectively. We also find significant regional differences and several negative features for resilience: short distance to city center, long home-to-work distance, high density of high-paying jobs, low road density, and high density of subway stations. By integrating both population group and region perspectives, we identify vulnerable population groups in specific regions. This integrated perspective can help design more targeted response and recovery strategies, and thereby promote health-related urban resilience and sustainability."

 Amidst the intensifying global climate change, the increasing frequency of extreme precipitation events poses significant challenges to natural ecosystems and human societies. Particularly within the context of rapid urbanization, the mechanisms underlying the influence of urban expansion on natural disasters such as landslides have emerged as a critical area of scientific inquiry requiring further exploration. While conventional wisdom often suggests that urbanization exacerbates the risks of geological hazards like landslides, the generality of this conclusion—given the intricate interplay of geographical and socio-economic factors—necessitates nuanced validation. This study adopts a fixed effects panel regression model, utilizing rainfall-induced landslides collected from field surveys, systematically analyze and quantitatively assess the impacts of precipitation variability on landslide hazards across regions with different levels of urbanization. Our observations reveal that, contrary to highly urbanized areas, regions with low levels of urbanization exhibit increased sensitivity to landslides in response to fluctuations in precipitation. This pattern is consistent across multiple temporal scales of precipitation analysis, including monthly total precipitation and maximum daily, three-day, and five-day precipitation amounts. Furthermore, an in-depth investigation of specific cities reinforces our understanding of the complex relationship between urbanization and landslide risk. In particular, this study quantifies the contribution of historical precipitation changes to landslide events in Jiangxi Province, indicating that historical precipitation changes were responsible for approximately 7% of total landslide occurrences, directly leading to about 215 landslide events (with a confidence interval of 164 to 301). These findings underscore the pivotal role of precipitation as a primary trigger of landslides. This study provides a novel perspective on the evolutionary pattern of landslide disasters during urbanization and establishes a scientific foundation for the development of effective disaster prevention and mitigation strategies, which can significantly enhance urban resilience."

 Climate change poses significant challenges to food security, especially in semi-arid agriculture areas. Effective monitoring of crop yield is important for establishing food emergency responses and developing long-term sustainable strategies. In Morocco, where cereals are the predominant crops, yield forecasting is important for addressing the yield gap as it enables farmers to take preventive actions before the harvesting period. This study aims to assess the impact of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of environmental conditions on wheat yield forecasting using machine learning models. It compares the 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 agricultural seasons using three sets of variables: (1) spectral indices; (2) weather data; and (3) a combination of both spectral indices and weather data. Weather data, including cumulative monthly precipitation from ERA5 data and average monthly temperature from PERSIANN data, were extracted for the wheat growing season (November to June). Spectral indices including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Moisture Stress Index, and Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index were calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery for the same period and processed using Google Earth Engine. The study area was divided into homogeneous zones based on an existing landform classification, and XGBoost and Random Forest (RF) models were used for yield forecasting in each zone separately. The two models performed equally well across both the zones and the whole study area (SA) when using weather data as the input variable. For instance, across SA, they achieved average R2 values of 0.60 and 0.81 for all months during the 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 agricultural seasons, respectively. However, when using spectral indices or combining these indices with weather data, RF consistently outperformed XGBoost. For example, in SA during the 2019–2020 season, RF achieved an average R2 of 0.48 across the growing season, compared to XGBoost’s R2 of 0.43. Similarly, in the 2020–2021 season, RF achieved an R2 of 0.35 and an RMSE of 1083 kg ha-1, while XGBoost performed slightly lower, with an R2 of 0.29 and an RMSE of 1137 kg ha-1. Comparing the prediction accuracy between the seasons for each set of variables, the RF model performs better when using spectral indices during the relatively dry 2019–2020 season as compared to the wet 2020–2021 season. Incorporating weather data, the model improved its performance for the 2020–2021 season. April showed the highest prediction performance overall, with R2 values of 0.6 for SA using weather data alone in the 2019–2020 season, and 0.8 for SA using a combination of weather data and spectral indices in the 2020–2021 season. The 2019–2020 season showed strong fluctuations in accuracy throughout the growing season, whereas the 2020–2021 season had a consistent improvement in accuracy over time. These variations in accuracy are due to differing environmental conditions that should be taken into account for making better and more reliable yield predictions."

 Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) holds significant importance in remote sensing image processing and has been recently empowered by deep learning-based methods. Despite achieving good performance by reconstructing the background and suppressing abnormal targets, these methods often fail to distinguish the attributes of latent features during background reconstruction, resulting in unsatisfactory reconstruction quality. This occurs because the background usually has low-frequency properties and the anomalies have high-frequency properties, so these issues should be considered during background reconstruction. To overcome this weakness, a multi-scale frequency-guided two-stream network (MFTNet) is proposed for HAD. Firstly, considering the different frequency attributes of background and anomalies, we use an encoder to extract features and then design a multi-scale frequency decomposition module to decompose the features into high-frequency (HF) part for anomalies and the low-frequency (LF) part for background. Furthermore, different from anomaly suppression-based methods, we introduce a high-frequency enhancement module to highlight abnormal targets in the HF part, making them stand out in the background. Meanwhile, the features from the encoder contain more background information, so we fuse the encoded features and LF part features by a self-attention module to accurately recover the background. Finally, we perform anomaly detection on the reconstructed anomaly and background parts, respectively, and the average of those two results is the final detection map. Comparative analysis on six datasets against thirteen baseline methods, including seven effective deep learning-based methods, demonstrates that our proposed MFTNet delivers competitive detection results.

 Soil moisture drought poses a destructive effect on vegetation growth and water resource. Modeling event-based drought processes could serve as a pathway for better understanding how different types of soil moisture drought responds to larger-scale teleconnections in the monsoon and loess critical zone of China. Based on the daily soil moisture dataset named SMCI1.0 at top 1 m, we found that the Loess Plateau witnessed an aggravated summer soil moisture drought, with summer standardized soil moisture index (SSMI) decreasing by 1.5 % year−1 from 2000 to 2020. According to the durations and spatial coverage of events, we classified 12 summer soil moisture drought events occurring on the Loess Plateau into short-duration (6–14 days) and long-duration (≥15 days) types, and further discussed their different large-scale teleconnections. Interestingly, we found the short-duration (long-duration) summer soil moisture drought was influenced by wave train (blocking) circulation anomalies. The short-duration summer soil moisture drought broke out with an eastward “− + − +” wave train over Eurasia, which was mainly attributed to a tripolar sea surface temperature (SST) mode over the North Atlantic and weakened South Asian high (SAH) with westward shift. Such a structure resulted in water vapor deficit of Loess Plateau, and thus favored shorter summer soil moisture drought on the Loess Plateau. For the long-duration summer soil moisture drought, consistently warm tropical Atlantic and North Sea-Baltic Sea favored the “+ − +” wave train, weaking the southward movement of cold air and maintaining prolonged water vapor deficit accompanied by downward prevails, which consequently provided a favorable condition for more long-lasting and enhanced summer soil moisture deficit. Insights into the large-scale teleconnections related to the different types of soil moisture drought event not only can provide drought early warning information, but also offer a scientific guidance for revegetation projects on the Loess Plateau or other Eurasian drylands."

 Persistent severe rainfall (PSR) events are highly hazardous and cause significant disasters. This study focuses on extended-range forecasting of PSR. On the basis of the regional Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), the coupling of the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Atmosphere (MPAS-A) and the Dynamic Extended Forecasting framework for WRF (referred to as MPAS-EXT) was developed, enabling high-precision dynamic extended forecasts up to 20 days in advance. The study simulates the PSR event from June 18 to 21, 2022. Results show that the MPAS-A model provides a more accurate simulation of the large-scale weather systems during this PSR event, and the 500 hPa weather pattern simulation is more conducive to the occurrence of the PSR event. Regarding the location and intensity of the PSR event, MPAS-EXT provides more accurate simulations for both the rainfall location and intensity. Specifically, the model shows superior performance in simulating areas with precipitation exceeding 50 mm. Moreover, MPAS-EXT offers a more comprehensive and clear depiction of the rainband structure of the entire event, the simulations of water vapor flux and wind fields are closer to the results of ERA5. Through Threat Score (TS) and Fractions Skill Score (FSS) evaluations, MPAS-EXT has higher TS than the other experimental groups for 0–100 mm precipitation, for precipitation >50 mm, the FSS values increase as the neighborhood radius expands.

None,False,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究的是利用ESPRIT算法对宽带甚高频（VHF）闪电辐射源进行定位。它关注的是闪电的电磁辐射特性及其定位方法，与大气环境遥感技术（例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）并没有直接关系。大气环境遥感技术通常使用传感器来测量大气中的各种参数，例如气溶胶、温室气体和气态污染物的浓度，而这篇论文则集中在闪电定位这一特定问题上。因此，虽然闪电现象是大气过程的一部分，但这篇论文的研究重点与大气环境遥感技术的应用目标并不相同。,"['lightning', 'VHF radiation', 'ESPRIT algorithm', 'source localization']",Shuangjiang Du;Lihua Shi;Shi Qiu;Yantao Duan;Yun Li;Zheng Sun,Broadband VHF lightning radiation sources localization by ESPRIT algorithm,
