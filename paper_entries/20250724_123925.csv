10.5194/acp-25-7789-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了人为气溶胶对云、辐射和降水的影响，利用千米尺度的全球模型模拟了气溶胶与云的相互作用（ACI）和气溶胶与辐射的相互作用（ARI）。研究发现，这些影响在不同地区表现出很强的区域依赖性，并且气溶胶的辐射效应对云的影响具有明显的日变化规律，这意味着使用极地轨道卫星量化ACI和ARI的有效性可能比目前假设的要有限。虽然没有直接提到特定的遥感技术，但它与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它讨论了气溶胶、云和辐射之间的相互作用，这些都是大气环境遥感监测的重要参数，并且提到了极地轨道卫星的应用。,"['aerosol-cloud interactions', 'aerosol-radiation interactions', 'cloud radiative properties', 'radiative fluxes', 'precipitation', 'global climate models', 'satellite observations (polar-orbiting)', 'diurnal cycles', 'atmospheric composition (aerosols)']",Ross J.

Williams;Philipp Weiss;Duncan Watson-Parris;Elisabeth Dingley;Daniel Klocke;Philip Stier,Regional variability of aerosol impacts on clouds and radiation in global kilometer-scale simulations,"Clouds exist at scales that climate models struggle to represent, limiting our knowledge of how climate change may impact clouds. Here we use a new kilometer-scale global model representing an important step towards the necessary scale. We focus on how aerosol particles modify clouds, radiation, and precipitation. We find the magnitude and manner of responses tend to vary from region to region, highlighting the potential of global kilometer-scale simulations and a need to represent aerosols in climate models. 
 Anthropogenic aerosols are a primary source of uncertainty in future climate projections. Changes to aerosol concentrations modify cloud radiative properties, radiative fluxes, and precipitation from the microphysical to the global scale. Due to computational constraints, we have been unable to explicitly simulate cloud dynamics in global-scale simulations, leaving key processes, such as convective updrafts, parameterized. This has significantly limited our understanding of aerosol impacts on convective clouds and climate. However, new state-of-the-art climate models are capable of representing these scales. In this study, we used the kilometer-scale ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) Earth system model to explore the global-scale rapid response of clouds and precipitation to an idealized distribution of anthropogenic aerosol via aerosol–cloud (ACI) and aerosol–radiation (ARI) interactions. In our simulations over 30 d, we find that the aerosol impacts on clouds and precipitation exhibit strong regional dependence. The impact of ARI and ACI on clouds in isolation shows some consistent behavior, but the magnitude and additive nature of the effects are regionally dependent. Some regions are dominated by either ACI or ARI, whereas others behaved nonlinearly. This suggests that the findings of isolated case studies from regional simulations may not be globally representative;  ARI and ACI cannot be considered independently and should both be interactively represented in modeling studies. We also observe pronounced diurnal cycles in the rapid response of cloud microphysical and radiative properties, which suggests that the usefulness of using polar-orbiting satellites to quantify ACI and ARI may be more limited than presently assumed. The simulations highlight some limitations that need to be considered in future studies. Isolating kilometer-scale aerosol responses from internal variability will require longer averaging periods or ensemble simulations. It would also be beneficial to use interactive aerosols and assess the sensitivity of the conclusions to the cloud microphysics scheme."
10.5194/acp-25-7777-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用地基多轴差分吸收光谱法（MAX-DOAS）测量了洛杉矶东南部地区二氧化氮（NO2）和甲醛（HCHO）的垂直分布，并分析了它们在一天中的变化规律。研究发现，由于NO2和HCHO垂直分布的差异，基于卫星的测量结果在诊断臭氧生成化学过程中的应用会受到影响，并且这种影响会随时间变化。该研究还将地基测量结果与TROPOMI卫星观测数据进行了比较，发现NO2的垂直柱密度与卫星观测结果相关性较好，而HCHO的相关性较差。此外，研究还探讨了使用地基和卫星数据计算的HCHO与NO2比率（FNR）的差异，并评估了这些差异对臭氧超标概率的影响。总的来说，该研究对于理解洛杉矶地区臭氧污染的成因和利用卫星数据进行空气质量监测具有重要意义。,"['NO2', 'HCHO', 'Ozone', 'MAX-DOAS', 'TROPOMI', 'Vertical Column Density', 'Diurnal Variability', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Satellite Observations', 'Atmospheric Composition Analysis']",Peter K. Peterson;Lisa F. Hernandez;Leslie Tanaka;Alejandro Dunnick,Measurement report: Diurnal variability in NO2 and HCHO lower-tropospheric vertical profiles in southeastern Los Angeles,"This work uses spectroscopy to examine the vertical distribution of nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde in southeastern Los Angeles, USA, a region heavily impacted by ozone pollution. We examine how both the amount and vertical profile of the two species vary throughout the day, finding that differences between the two species impact the utilization of satellite-based measurements to diagnose ozone production chemistry and that these impacts are variable depending on the time of day. 
 Ground-level ozone in excess of the United States National Ambient Air Quality Standards remains a prevalent issue across Southern California, particularly in the summer months. To improve our understanding of the vertical distribution of ozone precursors in Southern California, we used ground-based multi-axis differential absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements in Whittier, California, to simultaneously retrieve both near-surface mole fractions and vertical column densities (VCDs) of both NO2 and HCHO. Ratios of HCHO to NO2, commonly referred to as FNR, derived from satellite-based measurements are used to diagnose ozone production chemistry over regions without consistent surface-based measurements. While VCDs of NO2 are well correlated with TROPOMI observations over the study period (R=0.73), HCHO VCDs and FNRs derived from MAX-DOAS observations are less well correlated (R=0.48 and 0.59, respectively). These observations also showed differing diurnal cycles between near-surface mixing ratios and VCDs due to variability in the vertical profile; this diurnal behavior will be increasingly critical to understand given the ongoing shift from Sun-synchronous to geostationary satellite observations.  Using ground-based measurements, we determined FNRs using both surface mole fractions and VCDs, finding that FNRs derived from surface mole fractions are generally lower than those derived from column-based measurements. Evaluating the ozone exceedance probability as a function of FNR for both quantities suggests that the transition from volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited to NOx-limited regimes may begin at lower FNR values than those derived from satellite-based measurements in East Los Angeles. We find that these differences in FNRs derived from ground-based and satellite-based measurements are driven by variability in the vertical distribution of HCHO. These impacts are most pronounced in late afternoon, when ozone exceedances are most prevalent."
10.5194/acp-25-7765-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文提出了一种新的方法（CP方法）来量化多因素系统中各个因素对不确定性的贡献，并将其应用于分析气溶胶辐射相互作用中各因素的不确定性。该研究发现气溶胶壳材料的复折射率、光吸收碳参数和米氏理论参数是影响气溶胶辐射相互作用的主要因素。由于这些因素的高敏感性和低观测精度，它们是气溶胶辐射相互作用中不确定性的重要来源。因此，需要优先考虑对这些因素进行业务观测和模型参数输入。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它关注气溶胶的特性以及它们如何影响太阳辐射，这对于空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析至关重要，并最终影响我们对气候变化的理解。,"['aerosol-radiation interaction', 'radiative forcing', 'aerosol composition (complex refractive index, light-absorbing carbon)', 'uncertainty analysis', 'climate change', 'solar radiation', 'Mie theory']",Bishuo He;Chunsheng Zhao,A novel method to quantify the uncertainty contribution of aerosol–radiation interaction factors,"Factor uncertainty analysis helps us understand the impacts of factors on complex systems. Traditional methods have many limitations. This study introduces a new method to measure how each factor contributes to uncertainty. It gains insights into the role of each variable and works for all multi-factor systems. As an application, we analyzed how aerosols affect solar radiation and identified the key factors. These analyses can improve our understanding of the role of aerosols in climate change. 
 The IPCC's assessment report shows that the radiative forcing of aerosol–radiation interactions still involves significant uncertainty. The commonly used method for factor uncertainty estimation is the one-at-a-time (OAT) method, which evaluates factor sensitivity by controlling the change in a single variable while keeping others constant. The outcomes from the OAT method require high data quality to ensure accuracy, and the results are only valid near the selected constant. This study proposes a new method called the Constrained Parameter (CP) method to quantify the uncertainty contribution of factors in a multi-factor system. This method constrains the uncertainty of a single factor between two Monte Carlo simulations and evaluates its sensitivity by analyzing how this change affects output uncertainty. The most significant advantage of the CP method is that it can be applied to any data distribution, and its results can reflect the overall data characteristics. The proportion of factor interactions in the factor uncertainty contributions can be obtained by comparing the results calculated by the CP method and the OAT method. As an application of the CP method, it performs a detailed analysis of aerosol–radiation interaction factors' uncertainty contributions. The top three most sensitive factors are the complex refractive index of aerosol shell materials, light-absorbing carbon parameters, and Mie theory parameters. Due to their high sensitivity and low observational precision, these factors represent significant sources of uncertainty in aerosol–radiation interactions. These factors need to be prioritized for operational observation programs and model parameter inputs."

Haase;Michael J. Murphy Jr.;Anna M. Wilson,Observing atmospheric rivers using multi-GNSS airborne radio occultation: system description and data evaluation,"This paper describes an airborne radio occultation (ARO) observation system installed on a reconnaissance aircraft that uses GPS signal refraction in the atmosphere to retrieve information about the temperature and moisture in the storm environment as far away as 400 km surrounding the flight track. The characteristics and quality of 1700 ARO refractivity profiles were assessed. These observations are collected to help understand atmospheric rivers and improve their forecasting. 
 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow filaments of high moisture flux responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor from the tropics to mid-latitudes. Improving forecasts of ARs through numerical weather prediction (NWP) is important for increasing the resilience of the western United States (US) to flooding and droughts. These NWP forecasts rely on the improved understanding of AR physics and dynamics from satellite, radar, aircraft, and in situ observations, and now airborne radio occultation (ARO) can contribute to those goals. The ARO technique is based on precise measurements of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signal delays collected from a receiver on board an aircraft from setting or rising GNSS satellites. ARO inherits the advantages of high vertical resolution and all-weather capability of spaceborne RO observations and has the additional advantage of continuous and dense sampling of the targeted storm area. This work presents a comprehensive ARO dataset recovered from 4 years of AR Reconnaissance (AR Recon) missions over the eastern Pacific. The final dataset is comprised of ∼ 1700 ARO profiles from 39 flights over approximately 260 flight hours from multiple GNSS constellations. Profiles extend from aircraft cruising altitude (13–14 km) down into the lower troposphere, with more than 50 % of the profiles extending below 4 km, below which the receiver loses or cannot initiate signal tracking. The horizontal drift of the tangent points that comprise a given ARO profile greatly extends the area sampled from just underneath the aircraft to both sides of the flight track (up to ∼ 400 km). The estimated refractivity accuracy with respect to dropsondes is ∼ 1.2 % in the upper troposphere, where the sample points are closely colocated. For the lower troposphere, the agreement is within ∼ 7 %, which is the level of consistency expected given the nature of atmospheric variations over the 300–700 km separation between the lowest point and the dropsonde."

Across a large team of experts we have now identified all glaciers that end in lakes. Only about 1% do so, but they are generally larger than those which end on land. This is important to understand, as lakes can influence the behaviour of glacier ice, including how fast it disappears. This new dataset allows us to better model glaciers at a global scale, accounting for the effect of lakes. 
 Proglacial lakes at glacier termini have received widespread attention in the literature for their role in accelerating melt, velocity and contributing to cryospheric hazards. Although global and regional inventories for both glaciers and lakes exist, lake-terminating glaciers have not been consistently identified at the global scale. Based on the most recent global glacier inventory (RGI7), which so far only identifies some marine termini but none for lakes, we present a global inventory of lake-terminating glaciers, differentiating between three classes. The dataset corresponds to the year 2000 (± 1.5), matching to the timestamp of RGI7 outlines (2001, ± 6.2). We find that of 274,531 glaciers worldwide, 1.4 % terminate in lakes, varying between 0.5 and 6.7 % across 19 RGI regions. These glaciers account for 11.4 % of the total glacier area (0.2 to 41.8 % across regions). With multiple submitted flags available for 1260 individual glaciers, we find mapping conflicts to be low (6.7 %). The lake termini data set is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15524733 (Steiner et al., 2025) as well as at https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/lake_terminating.

Python, as the ultimate glue language, enables the use of codes from nearly any programming language like Fortran, C++, Rust, and others. FINAM is designed to simplify the integration of various models with minimal effort, as demonstrated through various examples ranging from simple to complex systems. 
 In this study, we present a new coupling framework named FINAM (short for “FINAM is not a model”). FINAM is designed to facilitate the coupling of models that were developed as standalone tools in the first place and to enable seamless model extensions by wrapping existing models into components with well-specified interfaces. Although established coupling solutions such as Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF), Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Soil (OASIS), or Yet Another Coupler (YAC) focus on highly parallel workflows, complex data processing, and regridding, FINAM prioritizes usability and flexibility, allowing users to focus on scientific exploration of coupling scenarios rather than technical complexities. FINAM emphasizes ease of use for end users to create, run, and modify model couplings, as well as for model developers to create and maintain components for their models. The framework is particularly suited for applications where rapid prototyping and flexible model extensions are desired. It is primarily targeting environmental models, including ecological models for animal populations, individual-based forest models, field-scale crop models, economical models, and hydrological models. Python's robust interoperability features further enhance FINAM's capabilities, allowing us to wrap and use models written in various programming languages like Fortran, C, C++, Rust, and others. This paper describes the main principles and modules of FINAM and presents example workflows to demonstrate its features. These examples range from simple toy models to well-established models like OpenGeoSys and Bodium covering features like bidirectional dependencies, complex model coupling, and spatiotemporal regridding."

In the past decades, many geoscientists have been using Mindat data, but an open data service has never been fully established. The machine interface described in this paper will be an efficient way to meet the overwhelming data needs. 
 Technologies such as machine learning and deep learning are powering the discovery of meaningful patterns in Earth science big data. In the field of mineralogy, Mindat (“mindat.org”) is one of the largest databases. Although its front-end website is open and free, a machine interface for bulk data query and download had never been set up before 2022. Through a project called OpenMindat, an application programming interface (API) to enable open data query and access from Mindat was set up in 2023. To further lower the barrier between Mindat open data and geoscientists with limited coding skills, we developed an R package (OpenMindat v1.0.0) on top of the API. The Mindat API includes multiple data subjects such as geomaterials (e.g., rocks, minerals, synonyms, variety, mixture, and commodity), localities, and the IMA-approved (International Mineralogical Association) mineral list. The OpenMindat v1.0.0 package wraps the capabilities of the Mindat API and is designed to be user-friendly and extensible. In addition to providing functions for querying data subjects on the API, the package supports exporting data to various formats. In real-world applications, these functions only require minor coding for users to get desired datasets, and various other packages in the R environment can be used to analyze and visualize the data. The OpenMindat v1.0.0 package, which includes detailed tutorials and examples, is available on GitHub under the MIT license. The field of mineralogy and many other geoscience disciplines are facing opportunities enabled by open data. Various research topics such as mineral network analysis, mineral association rule mining, mineral ecology, mineral evolution, and critical minerals have already benefited from Mindat's open data efforts in recent years. We hope this R package can help accelerate those data-intensive studies and lead to more scientific discoveries."

Testing on real borehole data validated its effectiveness across various fault orientations. The supervised approach represents a significant improvement over older methods that relied on simpler clustering techniques which were capable of identifying fewer orientations of potential faults. 
 The study presents a novel approach for fault detection on subsurface geological homoclinal interfaces (slopes) using a supervised learning algorithm and careful input variable (feature) selection. Synthetic faulted slopes are generated using Delaunay triangulation via the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL), allowing for adjustments of parameters. We introduce 24 features, including local geometric features and neighborhood analysis, for classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed as the classification algorithm, achieving high precision and recall rates for fault-related observations. Application to real borehole data (elevations of buried stratigraphic contacts) demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in detecting fault orientations; the challenges remain with respect to distinguishing faults with opposite dip directions. The study highlights the need to address 3D fault zone complexities and their identification. Despite limitations, the proposed supervised approach offers significant advancement over clustering-based methods, showing promise in detecting faults of various orientations. Future research directions include exploring more complex geological scenarios and refining fault detection methodologies."

This promotion effect was achieved through the cooperation of PDS and O2 which was mediated by Ni2–N6 sites bridging electron transfer from PDS to O2, thereby suppressing the energy barriers of rate-determining steps.

This study was designed to elucidate the effects of GLY on male reproductive health by in vivo and in vitro studies. Data showed that chronic environmental levels of GLY reduced sperm quality and spermatogenic cell number in mice. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that GLY downregulated key glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes HK2 and PFK1, and decreased lactate abundance, while a strong positive correlation between sperm quality and lactate level was established. Further assays showed that GLY inhibited the expression of four glycolytic key proteins and disrupted the HK2 mitochondrial localization. Molecular docking and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that HK2 binds to VDAC1 on the mitochondrial outer membrane, which was inhibited by GLY. This inhibition was significantly alleviated by VBIT-4, an inhibitor of VDAC1 oligomerization. Notably, oxidative stress-mediated VDAC1 oligomerization due to excessive mitochondrial fission was identified as a key mechanism by which GLY inhibits glycolysis in Sertoli cells. In summary, this study uncovers a novel metabolic regulatory mechanism by which GLY impairs spermatogenesis via the VDAC1-HK2-glycolysis axis, providing critical insights for preventing GLY-induced reproductive toxicity and related environmental risks."

Multiple past studies reveal broad variation of stream water MeHg and total Hg (THg) concentration responses to forest harvesting, which has confounded messaging to forest and resource managers. To advance beyond divergent and sometimes contradictory findings, we synthesized information for 23 previously studied catchments in North America and Fennoscandia and compiled a uniform set of soil, landscape, and harvesting properties to identify forest management, riparian, and hillslope factors that influence responses of stream water MeHg and THg concentrations. From this synthesis, we found catchments with high soil moisture and organic soil layers >100 cm to be at highest risk for disturbance-induced increases in MeHg formation after harvest but not necessarily affecting concentrations of MeHg in stream waters. Instead, the combination of MeHg formation in soils along with factors that affect mobilization with runoff to streams most influenced how forest harvest affects MeHg concentrations in stream waters."

Using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and high-throughput sequencing, we investigated DOM and microbiota across weakly acidic silty loam topsoil (0–20 cm) and subsoil (80–100 cm) along eroding–depositional gradients in a maize-cropped Mollisol agroecosystem. The overall chemodiversity, composition, and complexity of the DOM molecule pool were higher in topsoil than subsoil, but their topographical differences were predominantly observed in the subsoil, indicating erosion-induced homogenization of surface molecular fingerprints. Depositional subsoil increased DOM molecular diversity and accumulated recalcitrant lignin/tannin compounds, contrasting lipid enrichment at the eroding subsoil. Thermodynamic analysis via substrate-explicit models confirmed reduced DOM bioavailability in depositional subsoil compared to its erosional counterpart. Across both soil layers, microbial α-diversity metrics declined at eroding sites but increased at depositional sites. Crucially, these metrics negatively correlated with the diversity and complexity of DOM molecules in the topsoil yet positively correlated in the subsoil. These divergent patterns reflect depth-dependent microbial strategies─surface microbes favored labile substrates, while subsurface specialists utilized complex compounds. Our findings highlight subsoil as a critical zone where erosion–deposition processes establish distinct DOM–microbe interfaces governing soil organic matter stabilization."

It shows the potential of a paradigm shift from conventional metal removal to high-efficiency resource recovery for heavy metal wastewaters. Overcoming the surface reduction constraints inherent to nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI), the mechano-chemistry of microscale zerovalent iron (mZVI) (MC + mZVI) harnesses the mechanical energy to unite chemical bonding and lattice integration. This system achieved removal rates that exceed those of nZVI by factors of 3.0 and 5.7 for Cu(II) and Ni(II), respectively.

However, the influence of oxidative aging and the SOA oxidation state on the ROS yield has not been systematically investigated.

We observe maximum radical formation at an oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O/C) of ∼0.5. Thereafter, we observe a >90% decrease in radical yield as the O/C increases to 1.2 for both d-limonene SOA and β-caryophyllene SOA. Similarly, the radical yield in d-limonene and β-caryophyllene SOA is reduced by >80% after on-filter photoirradiation.

Chlorine gas (Cl2), a precursor for Cl atoms, is emitted from anthropogenic activities, including cleaning, disinfection, and industrial activities, and it also forms from heterogeneous reactions involving sea salt. Thus, limonene and Cl radical precursors can both be present in indoor and outdoor environments. We studied the chlorine-initiated oxidation of limonene under indoor lighting (LED lights) and simulated outdoor lighting (a combination of UVA and LED lights) using an environmental chamber and a suite of instruments measuring gas and particle phase products. OH radicals formed and dominated the oxidation of limonene in the presence of NOx, Cl2, and LED lights, highlighting that Cl-initiated chemistry can generate OH chemistry in indoor environments, even in the absence of sunlight. Measurements from an iodide chemical ionization mass spectrometer showed gas phase reaction products from both Cl and OH addition to limonene, including nitrated species LIMANO3 (C10H17NO4) and LIMALNO3 (C10H17NO6). Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields were high, exceeding 1.1 in experiments with low NOx and high limonene concentrations, and showed strong dependence on temperature, NOx, and the VOC/Cl2 ratio.

We add multiphase oxidation of SO2 in aerosol particles by H2O2, O3, NO2, HCHO, and O2, catalyzed by transition metal ions (TMIs), to the GEOS-Chem model and evaluate the model with (1) year-round ground-based observations in Seoul, South Korea, (2) airborne observations from the KORUS-AQ field campaign, and (3) fall and winter ground-based observations in Beijing, China. Multiphase chemistry contributes 14% to 90% to total sulfate production depending on the location and season and increases model daily average sulfate by 2 to 3 μg m–3, with maximum daily increases up to 12 μg m–3. From winter to summer, oxidation pathways shift, with the largest fraction of multiphase sulfate production occurring during spring and summer due to oxidation by H2O2. Multiphase oxidation of SO2 by the H2O2 pathway reduces gas-phase H2O2 concentrations by −40% in spring, which improves model agreement with H2O2 airborne observations. Oxidation pathways also shift between cities, in particular the contribution from the TMI and NO2 pathways, which are more important in Beijing than in Seoul. This is due to higher levels of transition metals, and a larger impact of an overly shallow mixed layer in Beijing compared to Seoul. The implementation of multiphase aerosol chemistry in GEOS-Chem here allows for the use of this chemistry in other models that can address boundary layer errors, including WRF-GC and CESM-GC. The analysis presented here shows that this chemistry is important to the simulation of sulfate year-round, not only during haze events, and is unique in showing coupled gas- and aerosol-phase impacts of multiphase chemistry."

Isotopic data from shallow sediments of Great Salt Lake (GSL), UT, demonstrate a two‐phase shift in lake water and carbon budgets during the past 200 years. I suggest that these changes are associated with regional colonial settlement, which altered carbon budgets beginning in the mid‐19th century, and the hydrographic effects of a railroad causeway built in 1959.

The Cloud Profiling Radar and Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization carried by these satellites together retrieve detailed vertical structure of clouds, allowing for an objective decomposition of tropical clouds into distinct regimes. The identified cloud regimes are overall robust except that an increasing number of redundant high‐cloud clusters are produced as the specified number of clusters is increased. This redundancy arises because geometrically thin clouds with slightly different altitudes can be mathematically distant from one another in the clustering procedure despite their morphological similarity, suggesting that an excessive number of clusters only generates unrealistic subclasses of high clouds. Objective evaluation metrics indicate that the most appropriate number of clusters is four, where the clusters may be labeled as sparse multilayer clouds, low cloud, high cloud, and deep convective regimes. A five‐cluster classification is also deemed as reasonable, where a fifth regime of congestus clouds joins the other four regimes, practically equivalent to the four‐cluster solution."

 The multi-layered nucleolus serves as the primary site of ribosome biogenesis1,2, where successive maturation of small (SSU)3,4 and large (LSU)5 ribosomal subunit precursors occur. However, the spatio-functional relationship between pre-rRNA processing and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to changing cellular physiological demands have remained incompletely understood6,7. Here, our spatiotemporal analyses revealed a compartment-specific ribosomal subunit processing in human nucleoli, with SSU processomes maintained in fibrillar center/dense fibrillar component/periphery dense fibrillar component (FC/DFC/PDFC) domains while LSU pre-rRNAs largely transited to PDFC/granular component (GC) regions. Slow proliferating cells exhibited unexpected 5' external transcribed space (5' ETS)-centered SSU processing impairment, accompanied by FC/DFC structural remodeling and retarded SSU outflux. Direct 5' ETS processing perturbation at least partially recapitulated these FC/DFC alterations, supporting the functional interdependence between SSU processing and nucleolar architecture. Notably, anamniote bipartite nucleoli with merged FC/DFC compartments8,9 exhibited distinct 5' ETS distribution and slower pre-rRNA flux compared to multi-layered nucleoli in amniotes. Introducing a FC/DFC interface to bipartite nucleoli enhanced processing efficiency, indicating that evolutionary emergence of nested FC/DFC may have optimized pre-rRNA processing.

 There is an urgent need for efficient and innovative therapies to treat brain disorders such as psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Immunotherapies have proved to be efficient in many medical areas, but have not been considered to treat brain diseases due to the poor brain penetration of immunoglobulins1,2. Here we developed a bivalent biparatopic antibody, made of two camelid heavy-chain antibodies (called nanobodies)3, one binding to, and the other potentiating the activity of, homodimeric metabotropic glutamate receptor 2. We show that this bivalent nanobody, given peripherally, reaches the brain and corrects cognitive deficits in two preclinical mouse models with endophenotypes resulting from NMDA receptor hypofunction. Notably, these in vivo effects last for at least 7 days after a single intraperitoneal injection and are maintained after subchronic treatment. Our results establish a proof of concept that nanobodies can target brain receptors, and pave the way for nanobody-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of brain disorders.

 Salicylic acid (SA) is the active ingredient in willow bark that has been used for anti-inflammation and pain relief for centuries. Aspirin, a derivative of SA, is the most widely used medication in human history. SA also acts as a key plant defence hormone1–4. Although SA was known to be produced from chorismate in the model plant Arabidopsis5,6, how it is biosynthesized in plant families outside Brassicaceae remains unclear. Here we report the identification of a conserved pathway for SA biosynthesis in seed plants. Using Nicotiana benthamiana as a model, we identified three key steps for the biosynthesis of SA. First, ligation of benzoyl coenzyme A (CoA) and benzyl alcohol by benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyl transferase (BEBT) gives rise to benzyl benzoate, which is then hydroxylated by benzyl benzoate oxidase (BBO) to produce benzyl salicylate. Subsequent cleavage of benzyl salicylate by benzyl salicylate hydrolase (BSH) yields SA. Notably, genes encoding these three enzymes are present in a broad range of plants, and the genes from dicots such as willow, poplar and soybean as well as the monocot rice can complement the phenotype of SA-deficient mutants of N. benthamiana. Moreover, knockout analysis of the Oryza sativa OsBEBT, OsBBO and OsBSH genes reveals that they are required for SA biosynthesis in rice. Our findings suggest that the SA biosynthesis pathway is highly conserved in plants.

 Diverse sets of complete human genomes are required to construct a pangenome reference and to understand the extent of complex structural variation. Here we sequence 65 diverse human genomes and build 130 haplotype-resolved assemblies (median continuity of 130 Mb), closing 92% of all previous assembly gaps1,2 and reaching telomere-to-telomere status for 39% of the chromosomes. We highlight complete sequence continuity of complex loci, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), SMN1/SMN2, NBPF8 and AMY1/AMY2, and fully resolve 1,852 complex structural variants. In addition, we completely assemble and validate 1,246 human centromeres. We find up to 30-fold variation in α-satellite higher-order repeat array length and characterize the pattern of mobile element insertions into α-satellite higher-order repeat arrays. Although most centromeres predict a single site of kinetochore attachment, epigenetic analysis suggests the presence of two hypomethylated regions for 7% of centromeres. Combining our data with the draft pangenome reference1 significantly enhances genotyping accuracy from short-read data, enabling whole-genome inference3 to a median quality value of 45.

 Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have a pivotal cancer-supportive role, yet CAF-targeted therapies are lacking1,2. Here, using spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigate the role of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, NNMT-induced H3K27me3 hypomethylation drives complement secretion from CAFs, attracting immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumour. Nnmt knockout in immunocompetent mice impairs tumour growth in syngeneic ovarian, breast and colon tumour models through enhanced CD8+ T cell activation. Using high-throughput screening, we develop a potent and specific NNMT inhibitor that reduces the tumour burden and metastasis in multiple mouse cancer models and restores immune checkpoint blockade efficacy by decreasing CAF-mediated recruitment of MDSCs and reinvigorating CD8+ T cell activation. Our findings establish NNMT as a central CAF regulator and a promising therapeutic target to mitigate immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment.

 Although the role of cellular immunity in checkpoint immunotherapy (CPI) for cancer is well established1,2, the effect of antibody-mediated humoral immunity is comparably underexplored. Here we used rapid extracellular antigen profiling3 to map the autoantibody reactome within a cohort of 374 patients with cancer treated with CPIs and 131 healthy control participants for autoantibodies to 6,172 extracellular and secreted proteins (the ‘exoproteome’). Globally, patients with cancer treated with CPIs had diverse autoreactivities that were elevated relative to control individuals but changed minimally with treatment. Autoantibody signatures in patients treated with CPI strikingly distinguished them from healthy individuals. Although associations of specific autoantibodies with immune-related adverse events were sparse, we detected numerous individual autoantibodies that were associated with greatly altered odds ratios for response to therapy. These included autoantibodies to immunomodulatory proteins, such as cytokines, growth factors and immunoreceptors, as well as tumour surface proteins. Functional evaluation of several autoantibody responses indicated that they neutralized the activity of their target proteins, which included type I interferons (IFN-I), IL-6, OSM, TL1A, and BMPR1A and BMPR2. Modelling the effects of autoantibodies to IFN-I and TL1A in preclinical mouse tumour models resulted in enhanced CPI efficacy, consistent with their effects in patients. In conclusion, these findings indicate that autoantibodies to the exoproteome modify CPI responses and highlight therapeutically actionable pathways that can be exploited to augment immunotherapy.

 Genetic studies have identified thousands of individual disease-associated non-coding alleles, but the identification of the causal alleles and their functions remains a critical bottleneck1. CRISPR–Cas editing has enabled targeted modification of DNA to introduce and test disease alleles. However, the combination of inefficient editing, heterogeneous editing outcomes in individual cells and nonspecific transcriptional changes caused by editing and culturing conditions limits the ability to detect the functional consequences of disease alleles2,3. To overcome these challenges, we present a multi-omic single-cell sequencing approach that directly identifies genomic DNA edits, assays the transcriptome and measures cell-surface protein expression. We apply this approach to investigate the effects of gene disruption, deletions in regulatory regions, non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles and multiplexed editing. We identify the effects of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including the state-specific effects of an IL2RA autoimmune variant in primary human T cells. Multimodal functional genomic single-cell assays, including DNA sequencing, enable the identification of causal variation in primary human cells and bridge a crucial gap in our understanding of complex human diseases.

 Complex integumentary appendages such as avian feathers and mammalian hair play a principal role in tetrapod evolution, with critical functions in insulation, sensation, display and flight. Although feathers and hair originated in the stem-lineages of birds and mammals, respectively1,2, their underlying gene regulatory network has much deeper amniote roots3. The early evolution of amniote integumentary appendages, however, remains poorly understood because of the absence of fossil evidence. Here we present Mirasaura grauvogeli, a small-sized diapsid from the Middle Triassic epoch (about 247 million years ago) with a distinctive crest formed by elongate integumentary appendages extending serially along its back, similar to those of the poorly understood Triassic reptile Longisquama4–7. Despite its superficially bird-like skull, Mirasaura is not closely related to avemetatarsalians but instead belongs to the exclusively Triassic reptilian clade Drepanosauromorpha8. Melanosomes preserved in its integumentary appendages are consistent in geometry with melanosomes of feathers but not those of reptilian skin or mammalian hair. Nevertheless, the morphology of the integumentary appendages and phylogenetic placement of Mirasaura indicate that they are not structurally homologous to feathers or other integumentary appendages in living amniotes. Our findings show that complex integumentary appendages are not restricted to avemetatarsalians and mammaliaforms among amniotes and evolved in a lineage basal to all extant reptiles, challenging our understanding of the evolution of the reptilian integument.

 The miniaturization of transistors is approaching its limits owing to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed1. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics2 are being developed, which make use of the electron’s spin as well as its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study spin-wave propagation at the nanoscale and atomic scale a key challenge3,4. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to investigate spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant length scales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by local features. Here we detect bulk THz magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). By using high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel electron detectors, we overcome the challenges posed by weak signals to map THz magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons and exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks a milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the development of spintronic devices.

 To coexist with its resident microorganisms, the host must have a sense to adjust its behaviour in response to them. In the intestine, a sense for nutrients transduced to the brain through neuroepithelial circuits guides appetitive choices1–5. However, a sense that allows the host to respond in real time to stimuli arising from resident gut microorganisms remains to be uncovered. Here we show that in the mouse colon, the ubiquitous microbial pattern flagellin—a unifying feature across phyla6—stimulates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) in peptide YY (PYY)-labelled colonic neuropod cells. This stimulation leads to PYY release onto NPY2R vagal nodose neurons to regulate feeding. Mice lacking TLR5 in these cells eat more and gain more weight than controls. We found that flagellin does not act on the nerve directly. Instead, flagellin stimulates neuropod cells from the colonic lumen to reduce feeding through a gut–brain sensory neural circuit. Moreover, flagellin reduces feeding independent of immune responses, metabolic changes or the presence of gut microbiota. This sense enables the host to adjust its behaviour in response to a molecular pattern from its resident microorganisms. We call this sense at the interface of the biota and the brain the neurobiotic sense7. A study reveals a gut–brain sensory pathway through which the microbial component flagellin activates neuropod cells in the colon to signal the brain and reduce feeding in mice."

 Crops provide food, clothing and other important products for the global population. To meet the demands of a growing population, substantial improvements are required in crop yield, quality and production sustainability. However, these goals are constrained by various environmental factors and limited genetic resources. Overcoming these limitations requires a paradigm shift in crop improvement by fully leveraging natural genetic diversity alongside biotechnological approaches such as genome editing and the heterologous expression of designed proteins, coupled with multimodal data integration. In this Review, we provide an in-depth analysis of integrated uses of omics technologies, genome editing, protein design and high-throughput phenotyping, in crop improvement, supported by artificial intelligence-enabled tools. We discuss the emerging applications and current challenges of these technologies in crop improvement. Finally, we present a perspective on how elite alleles generated through these technologies can be incorporated into the genomes of existing and de novo domesticated crops, aided by a proposed artificial intelligence model. We suggest that integrating these technologies with agricultural practices will lead to a new revolution in crop improvement, contributing to global food security in a sustainable manner.

 Human history is born in writing. Inscriptions are among the earliest written forms, and offer direct insights into the thought, language and history of ancient civilizations. Historians capture these insights by identifying parallels—inscriptions with shared phrasing, function or cultural setting—to enable the contextualization of texts within broader historical frameworks, and perform key tasks such as restoration and geographical or chronological attribution1. However, current digital methods are restricted to literal matches and narrow historical scopes. Here we introduce Aeneas, a generative neural network for contextualizing ancient texts. Aeneas retrieves textual and contextual parallels, leverages visual inputs, handles arbitrary-length text restoration, and advances the state of the art in key tasks. To evaluate its impact, we conduct a large study with historians using outputs from Aeneas as research starting points. The historians find the parallels retrieved by Aeneas to be useful research starting points in 90% of cases, improving their confidence in key tasks by 44%. Restoration and geographical attribution tasks yielded superior results when historians were paired with Aeneas, outperforming both humans and artificial intelligence alone. For dating, Aeneas achieved a 13-year distance from ground-truth ranges. We demonstrate Aeneas’ contribution to historical workflows through analysis of key traits in the renowned Roman inscription Res Gestae Divi Augusti, showing how integrating science and humanities can create transformative tools to assist historians and advance our understanding of the past.

 Experiments that track hippocampal place cells in mice navigating the same real environment have found significant changes in neural representations over a period of days1,2. However, whether such ‘representational drift’ serves an intrinsic function, such as distinguishing similar experiences that occur at different times3,4, or is instead observed due to subtle differences in the sensory environment or behaviour5–7, remains unresolved. Here we used the experimental control offered by a multisensory virtual reality system to determine that differences in sensory environment or behaviour do not detectably change drift rate. We also found that the excitability of individual place cells was most predictive of their representational drift over subsequent days, with more excitable cells exhibiting less drift. These findings establish that representational drift occurs in mice even with highly reproducible environments and behaviour and highlight neuronal excitability as a key factor of long-term representational stability.

 Salicylic acid (SA) is a ubiquitous plant hormone with a long history in human civilization1,2. Because of the central role of SA in orchestrating plant pathogen defence, understanding SA biosynthesis is fundamental to plant immunity research and crop improvement. Isochorismate-derived SA biosynthesis has been well defined in Arabidopsis. However, increasing evidence suggests a crucial function for phenylalanine-derived SA biosynthesis in many other plant species1. Here we reveal the phenylalanine-derived SA biosynthetic pathway in rice by identifying three dedicated enzymes — peroxisomal benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyltransferase (BEBT), the endoplasmic reticulum-associated cytochrome P450 enzyme benzylbenzoate hydroxylase (BBH), and cytosolic benzylsalicylate esterase (BSE) that sequentially convert benzoyl-CoA to benzylbenzoate, benzylsalicylate and SA. The pathogen-induced gene expression pattern and SA biosynthetic functions of this triple-enzyme module are conserved in diverse plants. This work fills a major knowledge gap in the biosynthesis of a key plant defence hormone, establishing a foundation for new strategies to create disease-resistant crops.

 Achieving long-term underwater adhesion to dynamic, regenerating soft substrates that undergo extreme fluctuations in pH and moisture remains a major unresolved challenge, with far-reaching implications for healthcare, manufacturing, robotics and marine applications1–16. Here, inspired by remoras—fish equipped with specialized adhesive discs—we developed the Mechanical Underwater Soft Adhesion System (MUSAS). Through detailed anatomical, behavioural, physical and biomimetic investigations of remora adhesion on soft substrates, we uncovered the key physical principles and evolutionary adaptations underlying their robust attachment. These insights guided the design of MUSAS, which shows extraordinary versatility, adhering securely to a wide range of soft substrates with varying roughness, stiffness and structural integrity. MUSAS achieves an adhesion-force-to-weight ratio of up to 1,391-fold and maintains performance under extreme pH and moisture conditions. We demonstrate its utility across highly translational models, including in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo settings, enabling applications such as ultraminiaturized aquatic kinetic temperature sensors, non-invasive gastroesophageal reflux monitoring, long-acting antiretroviral drug delivery and messenger RNA administration via the gastrointestinal tract.

 Coherent quantum transition spectroscopy is a powerful tool in metrology1, quantum information processing2, magnetometry3 and precision tests of the standard model4. It was applied with great success in proton and deuteron magnetic moment measurements5, which culminated in maser spectroscopy with sub-parts-per-trillion resolution6 and many other experiments at the forefront of physics7. All of these experiments were performed on macroscopic ensembles of particles, whereas the coherent spectroscopy of a ‘free’ single nuclear spin has, to our knowledge, never been reported before. Here we demonstrate coherent quantum transition spectroscopy of the spin of a single antiproton stored in a cryogenic Penning-trap system. We apply a multi-trap technique8, detect the antiproton spin state using the continuous Stern–Gerlach effect9 and transport the particle to the homogeneous magnetic field of a precision trap (PT). Here we induce the coherent dynamics and analyse the result by quantum-projection measurements in the analysis trap (AT)10. We observe, for the first time, Rabi oscillations of an antiproton spin and achieve in time-series measurements spin-inversion probabilities greater than 80% at spin coherence times of about 50 s. Scans of single-particle spin resonances show inversions greater than 70%, at transition linewidths 16 times narrower than in previous measurements8, limited by cyclotron frequency measurement decoherence. This achievement marks a notable step towards at least tenfold improved tests of matter/antimatter symmetry using proton and antiproton magnetic moments.

 Many animals use vision to navigate their environment. The pattern of changes that self-motion induces in the visual scene, referred to as optic flow1, is first estimated in local patches by directionally selective neurons2–4. However, how arrays of directionally selective neurons, each responsive to motion in a preferred direction at specific retinal positions, are organized to support robust decoding of optic flow by downstream circuits is unclear. Understanding this global organization requires mapping fine, local features of neurons across an animal’s field of view3. In Drosophila, the asymmetrical dendrites of the T4 and T5 directionally selective neurons establish their preferred direction, which makes it possible to predict directional tuning from anatomy4,5. Here we show that the organization of the compound eye shapes the systematic variation in the preferred directions of directionally selective neurons across the entire visual field. To estimate the preferred directions across the visual field, we reconstructed hundreds of T4 neurons in an electron-microscopy volume of the full adult fly brain6, and discovered unexpectedly stereotypical dendritic arborizations. We then used whole-head micro-computed-tomography scans to map the viewing directions of all compound eye facets, and found a non-uniform sampling of visual space that explains the spatial variation in preferred directions. Our findings show that the global organization of the directionally selective neurons’ preferred directions is determined mainly by the fly’s compound eye, revealing the intimate connections between eye structure, functional properties of neurons and locomotion control.

 Malaria remains a substantial global health challenge, causing approximately half a million deaths each year1. The mosquito fibrinogen-related protein 1 (FREP1) is required for malaria parasites to infect the midgut epithelium2. The naturally occurring FREP1Q allele has been reported to prevent parasite infection, while supporting essential physiological functions in the mosquito3. Here we generate congenic strains of Anopheles stephensi, edited to carry either the parasite-susceptible FREP1L224 or the putative-refractory FREP1Q224 alleles. The FREP1Q224 allele confers robust resistance to infection by both human and rodent malaria parasites, with negligible fitness costs. The protective FREP1Q224 allele can be efficiently driven into FREP1L224 mosquito populations using a novel linked allelic-drive system that selectively replaces the L224 codon with the parasite-refractory Q224 allele, thereby rendering populations refractory to parasite infection. This antimalaria drive system provides a novel genetic approach to aid in malaria elimination efforts. Coupling of a FREP1 variant to a gene-drive system allows the spread of a host malaria resistance allele through the mosquito population."

 Our knowledge of biogeographic patterns and processes in the deep sea has been limited by the lack of integrated datasets that cover its vast extent1. Here we analyse a new global dataset of genomic DNA sequences, spanning an entire taxonomic class of benthic invertebrates (Ophiuroidea), to obtain a broad understanding of phylogenetic divergence and biotic movement across all oceans, from coastal margins down to the abyssal plains. We show that regional faunas on the continental shelf are phylogenetically divergent, particularly at temperate and tropical latitudes. By contrast, assemblages in the deep sea are much more connected. Many temperate deep-sea lineages have achieved distribution ranges across the planet, including over the Quaternary period. A close relationship exists between deep-sea faunas of the northern Atlantic and, on the opposite side of the globe, southern Australia. Bathymetric interchange is not only reliant on vertical migration through isothermal polar waters but also occurs across the thermal depth gradients of tropical regions. The connected nature of deep-sea life should be an important consideration in marine conservation assessments.

 Since the advent of computing, humans have sought computer input technologies that are expressive, intuitive and universal. While diverse modalities have been developed, including keyboards, mice and touchscreens, they require interaction with a device that can be limiting, especially in on-the-go scenarios. Gesture-based systems use cameras or inertial sensors to avoid an intermediary device, but tend to perform well only for unobscured movements. By contrast, brain–computer or neuromotor interfaces that directly interface with the body’s electrical signalling have been imagined to solve the interface problem1, but high-bandwidth communication has been demonstrated only using invasive interfaces with bespoke decoders designed for single individuals2–4. Here, we describe the development of a generic non-invasive neuromotor interface that enables computer input decoded from surface electromyography (sEMG). We developed a highly sensitive, easily donned sEMG wristband and a scalable infrastructure for collecting training data from thousands of consenting participants. Together, these data enabled us to develop generic sEMG decoding models that generalize across people. Test users demonstrate a closed-loop median performance of gesture decoding of 0.66 target acquisitions per second in a continuous navigation task, 0.88 gesture detections per second in a discrete-gesture task and handwriting at 20.9 words per minute. We demonstrate that the decoding performance of handwriting models can be further improved by 16% by personalizing sEMG decoding models. To our knowledge, this is the first high-bandwidth neuromotor interface with performant out-of-the-box generalization across people.

 Evading imminent threat from predators is critical for animal survival. Effective defensive strategies can vary, even between closely related species. However, the neural basis of such species-specific behaviours remains poorly understood1–4. Here we find that two sister species of deer mice (genus Peromyscus)5 show different responses to the same looming stimulus: Peromyscus maniculatus, which occupies densely vegetated habitats, predominantly escapes, whereas the open field specialist, Peromyscus polionotus, briefly freezes. This difference arises from species-specific escape thresholds, is largely context-independent, and can be triggered by both visual and auditory threat stimuli. Using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological recordings, we find that although visual threat activates the superior colliculus in both species, the role of the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG) in driving behaviour differs. Whereas dPAG activity scales with running speed in P. maniculatus, neural activity in the dPAG of P. polionotus correlates poorly with movement, including during visually triggered escape. Moreover, optogenetic activation of dPAG neurons elicits acceleration in P. maniculatus but not in P. polionotus, and their chemogenetic inhibition during a looming stimulus delays escape onset in P. maniculatus to match that of P. polionotus. Together, we trace species-specific escape thresholds to a central circuit node, downstream of peripheral sensory neurons, localizing an ecologically relevant behavioural difference to a specific region of the mammalian brain. Visual threat triggers contrasting freeze and escape defensive responses in two species of deer mice as a result of different activation thresholds downstream of the superior colliculus in the dorsal periaqueductal grey."

 Salicylic acid (SA) is a pivotal phytohormone for plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Plants have evolved two pathways to produce SA: the isochorismate synthase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) pathways1. Whereas the isochorismate synthase pathway has been fully identified2–4, the PAL pathway remains incomplete. Here we report the full characterization of the PAL pathway for SA biosynthesis via functional analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) SA-DEFICIENT GENE 1 (OSD1) to OSD4. The cinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase OSD1 catalyses the conversion of trans-cinnamic acid to cinnamoyl-CoA, which is subsequently transformed to benzoyl-CoA via the β-oxidative pathway in peroxisomes. The resulting benzoyl-CoA is further converted to benzyl benzoate by the peroxisomal benzoyltransferase OSD2. Benzyl benzoate is subsequently hydroxylated to benzyl salicylate by the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-resident cytochrome P450 OSD3, which is ultimately hydrolysed to salicylic acid by the cytoplasmic carboxylesterase OSD4. Evolutionary analyses reveal that the PAL pathway was first assembled before the divergence of gymnosperms and has been conserved in most seed plants. Activation of the PAL pathway in rice significantly enhances salicylic acid levels and plant immunity. Completion of the PAL pathway provides critical insights into the primary salicylic acid biosynthetic pathway across plant species and offers a precise target for modulating crop immunity. Characterization of four SALICYLIC ACID-DEFICIENT GENEs in rice identifies an ancestral pathway for biosynthesis of salicylic acid from phenylalanine and provides genetic targets for engineering disease resistance in crop plants."

 In their landmark study1, Fecht and Johnson unveiled a phenomenon that they termed the ‘entropy catastrophe’, a critical point where the entropy of superheated crystals equates to that of their liquid counterparts. This point marks the uppermost stability boundary for solids at temperatures typically around three times their melting point. Despite the theoretical prediction of this ultimate stability threshold, its practical exploration has been prevented by numerous intermediate destabilizing events, colloquially known as a hierarchy of catastrophes2–5, which occur at far lower temperatures. Here we experimentally test this limit under ultrafast heating conditions, directly tracking the lattice temperature by using high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering. Our gold samples are heated to temperatures over 14 times their melting point while retaining their crystalline structure, far surpassing the predicted threshold and suggesting a substantially higher or potentially no limit for superheating. We point to the inability of our samples to expand on these very short timescales as an important difference from previous estimates. These observations provide insights into the dynamics of melting under extreme conditions. Gold samples can be heated to more than 14 times their melting point while retaining their crystalline structure, far surpassing the predicted entropy catastrophe threshold and suggesting a substantially higher or potentially no limit for superheating."

 Mycorrhizal fungi are ecosystem engineers that sustain plant life and help regulate Earth’s biogeochemical cycles1–3. However, in contrast to plants and animals, the global distribution of mycorrhizal fungal biodiversity is largely unknown, which limits our ability to monitor and protect key underground ecosystems4,5. Here we trained machine-learning algorithms on a global dataset of 25,000 geolocated soil samples comprising >2.8 billion fungal DNA sequences. We predicted arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungal richness and rarity across terrestrial ecosystems. On the basis of these predictions, we generated high-resolution, global-scale maps and identified key reservoirs of highly diverse and endemic mycorrhizal communities. Intersecting protected areas with mycorrhizal hotspots indicated that less than 10% of predicted mycorrhizal richness hotspots currently exist in protected areas. Our results describe a largely hidden component of Earth’s underground ecosystems and can help identify conservation priorities, set monitoring benchmarks and create specific restoration plans and land-management strategies.

Here, authors introduce a reversible calcium additive that regulates polysulfides chemistry and catalyzes sulfur redox reactions, improving energy density with stable cycling. 
 Realizing practical lithium–sulfur batteries with high energy density requires lean electrolyte design. However, under low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios, highly concentrated lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte phase limit cycling and capacity. Here, we report that a small amount of Lewis acidic calcium cation in the electrolyte addresses the problems of lean electrolyte lithium–sulfur batteries. Because of its Lewis acidity, Ca2+ readily converts lithium polysulfides into CaS and S8, preventing electrolyte jamming, polysulfide shuttle and Li corrosion. The in situ-formed CaS catalyzes the reduction reaction of lithium polysulfides. Ca2+ rejuvenates via electrochemical oxidation of CaS during charging, enabling a sustainable interconversion between Ca2+ and CaS during cycling. Li-S pouch cells with Ca2+ additive delivered an energy density of 493 Wh kg−1 (E/S of 2.4 μL mg−1) based on the total mass of the cell excluding external packaging, with 70% capacity retention at 220 cycle under 1 mA cm−2 discharge, and 346 Wh kg−1 (2.9 μL mg−1) with 77% capacity retention at 360 cycle under 1.0 C 2 mA cm−2 discharge. The judicious integration of lithium-sulfur and calcium-sulfur chemistries offers a handy but effective approach to overcome the long-lasting trade-off between energy density and cycling stability in the development of lithium–sulfur batteries.

 CD4+ T cells are crucial for protective immunity to intracellular pathogens. In addition to secreting cytokines, CD4+ T cells promote control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection through cognate interactions with macrophages, but the mechanism has been unclear. Here, we show that SLAMF1/CD150 is highly and uniquely induced in macrophages by antigen-specific interactions with CD4+ T cells. In macrophages, SLAMF1 enhances the generation of reactive oxygen species and restricts Mtb replication. Mtb-infection of mice promotes SLAMF1 expression specifically on infected macrophages, not uninfected bystanders. SLAMF1 expression depends on adaptive immunity and also autophagy. Moreover, Slamf1−/− mice have higher Mtb burden and more rapid disease progression than wild type mice. Using Slamf1fl/fl conditional knock-out mice, we show that in vivo Slamf1 is specifically required in macrophages to restrict mycobacterial growth and limit IL-1β production. In macaques, macrophage SLAMFI expression also correlates with T cell responses and protection. Combined, these data demonstrate that SLAMF1 is a marker of macrophage-T cells interactions, and it promotes protection against Mtb.

Here the authors propose pseudochaotic many-body dynamics, which is indistinguishable from chaotic dynamics and can generate pseudorandom states using polylogarithmic-depth circuits. 
 Quantum chaos is central to understanding quantum dynamics and is crucial for generating random quantum states, a key resource for quantum information tasks. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum many-body dynamics, termed pseudochaotic dynamics. Although distinct from chaotic dynamics, out-of-time-ordered correlators, the key indicators of quantum chaos, fail to distinguish them. Moreover, pseudochaotic dynamics generates pseudorandom states that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random states. We construct pseudochaotic dynamics by embedding a smaller k-qubit subsystem into a larger n-qubit system. We demonstrate that a subsystem of size

               is sufficient to induce pseudochaotic behavior in the entire n-qubit system. Furthermore, we construct a quantum circuit exhibiting pseudochaotic dynamics and demonstrate that it generates pseudorandom states within

 The endogenous opioid system provides powerful control over emotions, nociception, and motivation among many other fundamental nervous system functions. Its major components include a panel of opioid peptides that activate four canonical inhibitory opioid receptors. However, its regulatory principles are not fully understood including the existence of additional receptors and other elements. In this study we report the identification of a receptor for the opioid peptide dynorphin. By conducting a screen of a custom library of neuropeptides, we found that orphan receptor GPR139 binds to and is activated by a series of dynorphin peptides. Unlike other opioid receptors, GPR139 couples to Gq/11 and avoids β-arrestin, providing excitatory signaling that homeostatically scales the inhibitory response of neurons to dynorphin. This introduces a non-canonical dynorphin receptor as an essential component of the opioid system.

 Oil repellency is essential for enabling self-cleaning, anti-soiling and stain-repelling properties, which has broad application in industries liked textiles, healthcare and electronics. While per-and-polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exhibits strong oleophobicity, their environmental and health risks have led to prohibition on long-chain PFAS ( ≥ C8) and restriction on short-chain PFAS (C4, C6). However, there are few alternative materials demonstrating comparable oil repellency. Here, we introduce a novel method to fletch polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brushes with ultrashort PFAS (singe -CF3, the least toxic PFAS), achieving oil repellency similar to short-chain PFAS while drastically reducing the fluorine content. This work highlights that liquid-like molecular design, rather than chain length, can enable sustainable oil repellency, facilitating a smoother transition away from PFAS reliance.

 Stable and predictable wet-season rainfall is crucial for soybean production in Brazil. However, climate and land-use changes, particularly Amazon deforestation, have increased rainfall variability in the region in recent decades. Here, we investigate long-term growing-season rainfall changes over two major soybean breadbaskets in Brazil from the perspective of atmospheric moisture transport. Utilising a novel moisture tracking framework based on a Lagrangian model guided by observations, we identify moisture source regions where evaporation contributed to rainfall over these breadbaskets. Furthermore, we quantify the relative contributions of source evaporation versus atmospheric (thermo)dynamics changes to downwind rainfall variability. Our results indicate that deforestation-induced evaporation declines have negatively impacted downwind rainfall in the breadbasket regions. However, strengthened circulation, evidenced by increased water vapour transport and low-level wind speeds consistent with decreased tree cover, has enhanced moisture transport from upwind regions (including Amazonia and the Atlantic Ocean) to the Brazilian soybean breadbaskets. This highlights the compensatory effects of deforestation on rainfall through decreased evaporation and altered atmospheric (thermo)dynamics, and how these effects may influence downwind soybean productivity in South America. Further understanding these interactions is critical for developing land management strategies to mitigate the agricultural impacts of climate change in the region."

 Open biomass burning has major impacts on the Earth system, including on air quality via the emission of primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Its effect on secondary inorganic PM2.5 formation is comparatively little investigated. Simulations with the EMEP MSC-W WRF atmospheric chemistry transport model reveal that global biomass burning emissions lead to elevated annual mean ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) concentrations in densely populated regions where biomass burning mostly does not occur. These regions include eastern USA, northwestern Europe, the Indo-Gangetic Plain and eastern China, where NH4NO3 conditional on biomass burning emissions constitutes between 29% and 51% of the annual mean PM2.5 conditional on biomass burning emissions. Biomass burning emissions of CO, NOx (NO and NO2) and volatile organic compounds perturb the HOx (OH and HO2) cycle globally, such that there is increased oxidation of anthropogenic NOx to HNO3. This results in additional contributions to local-scale secondary NH4NO3 in areas with high emissions of anthropogenic NOx and NH3. These teleconnections increase, by up to a factor of two, the contribution of biomass burning emissions to long-term PM2.5 concentrations, which measurements alone cannot identify as an impact of biomass burning activity. This may become relatively more important as anthropogenic sources of PM2.5 are reduced and as the wildfire component of biomass burning increases under climate change."

 Boreal forest is an important source of atmospheric aerosol particles, making clouds more reflective in a warmer climate. However, little is known about the aerosol effect on the scattering of radiation under a cloudy sky, which can have a cooling effect by enhancing the carbon uptake of boreal ecosystems. Here we show observational evidence that higher natural aerosol loadings associated with warmer conditions increase diffuse radiation in the presence of cumulus clouds and further invigorate photosynthesis in the boreal forest. The enhancement of photosynthesis occurs in the morning and evening or under clouds with cloud fraction 0.4–0.8, when moderate vapor pressure deficit keeps stomata in foliage open and the diffuse fertilization effect is maximized. The total effect of high aerosol loading is a further increase of the daily carbon uptake under cumulus clouds by 12% of the possible diffuse fertilization enhancement in the ecosystem. Our results provide observational support for the atmosphere-biosphere photosynthesis-based feedback, not only under clear sky but also under cumulus clouds frequently observed over boreal forest in summer.

 Sea-ice in the Southern Ocean plays a crucial role in transporting and redistributing freshwater/salt and heat via freezing, melting, and transport. Changes in northward freshwater transport by sea-ice and its melt are suggested to change the salinity of intermediate water and stratification, which could affect the global carbon budget.

Here, we estimate the ice-melt amount from the salinity deficit caused by the ice-melt, using ~25,000 spring hydrographic data. The spatial distribution of ice-melt reflects the northward advection of coastal thick-ice and its melting via the three cyclonic gyres. Combined with the estimation of sea-ice production, we further estimated the net freshwater flux by sea-ice in the Southern Ocean on an observational basis.

 No-till management is often recognized for its environmental and economic benefits, but its potential to reduce climate warming is still uncertain. Beyond ongoing debate over its effects on soil carbon storage, no-till also leaves plant residue on the surface, which can reflect more sunlight. This increase in surface reflectivity, called albedo, may help mitigate climate change by reducing the energy absorbed by the land. Here, we assessed this climate benefit of no-till across the U.S. Corn Belt using conservation survey records, county-level tillage data, and satellite observations. We found that no-till increased land surface brightness during the dormant season, reducing absorbed solar energy by an estimated 50 grams of CO2 equivalent per square meter per year. Regionally, this could add up to 24 teragrams of CO2 equivalent per year in potential climate benefits. Areas with low adoption, especially those with dark, carbon-rich soils, offer the greatest opportunity for further mitigation.

 Deadwood and decaying wood are the most important components for the biodiversity of boreal forests, and around a quarter of all flora and fauna in Finnish forests depend on them, with third of these species being red-listed. However, there is a severe lack of stand-level deadwood data in Finland, as the operational inventories either focus on the large-scale estimates or omit deadwood altogether. Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a cost-effective method for remotely mapping small objects, such as fallen deadwood, over compartment-level areas, as even the most spatially accurate commercial satellites and aerial photography provide 30 cm ground sampling distance, compared to less than 5 cm that is easily achievable with UAVs.In this study, we utilized YOLOv8 by Ultralytics for detecting and segmenting standing and fallen deadwood instances from RGB UAV imagery. Our study consists of two geographically distinct study areas in Finland, Hiidenportti National Park and Evo. We manually annotated around 13 800 deadwood instances to be used as the training and validation data for the instance segmentation models. These annotations were also compared to field-measured deadwood data from Hiidenportti to assess the extent on how much of the deadwood can even be seen from UAV imagery. We also compared how the models perform on another area than from which its training dataset was from, and whether adding data from another areas to the training dataset improves the performance compared to training only with images from one location.The best performing model achieved test set mask mAP50 score of 0.682 for Hiidenportti and 0.651 for Sudenpesänkangas datasets.

 Poverty is a pervasive global issue that adversely affects human well-being. Traditional socioeconomic censuses are time-consuming and resource-intensive, suffering from temporal delays, while reliance on nighttime light data with low spatial resolution is insufficient for fine-scale identification of impoverished regions. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of nighttime light in different urban functional zones has been overlooked. To address these shortcomings, we proposed a novel approach by integrating high-resolution SDGSAT-1 nighttime light data (10 m) with urban functional zoning data using a spatial overlay tool. A random forest model was then applied to predict county-level poverty identification in Guangdong, China. For comparative validation, traditional NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data (500 m) were also incorporated. This method effectively explored the nonlinear relationship between nighttime light, urban functional zones, and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI, serving as the dependent variable). Our experiments demonstrate that the integration of urban functional zoning with nighttime light moderately improves the accuracy of poverty estimates. Among the models tested, the one considering functional zoning-based indicators of “number of light pixels” and “sum of pixel light values” increased the correlation coefficient by 0.0158 compared to the model without considering these indicators. Additionally, comparative analysis revealed that high-resolution data from SDGSAT-1 exhibited a better fit with the MPI when integrated with functional zoning-based indicators. Specifically, the correlation coefficient of this combination was 0.0086 higher than that of traditional NPP-VIIRS data. This highlights that SDGSAT-1 can delineate the boundaries between dark and light regions more precisely, leading to a more accurate reflection of regional poverty levels. Our findings facilitate fine-scale poverty estimation across large regions. This approach can inform policy design, such as dynamic optimization of resource allocation based on poverty estimates, thus enabling timely and accurate poverty alleviation efforts."

 Serving as a powerful proxy in remote sensing studies, spectral indices can generate meaningful environmental interpretation from either raw or atmospherically corrected spectral data, and characterise and quantify some important properties of various objects on Earth’s surface. However, while numerous spectral indices have been developed over time, since the very launch of civilian satellites until now, some critical issues in their usage, such as comparability, remain scarcely studied, which may lead to incorrect, inconsistent, and unreliable results.In this study, we collected 471 spectral indices of various environment components (vegetation, water, and soil) that might be leveraged for soil studies, and traced their popularity in scientific publications over the past decades. The bibliometric analysis revealed a growing interest and utilisation of spectral indices as Earth-observing satellite technology advanced. Based on both literature and, for sake of complementation and illustration, some targeted regional-scale case studies, we discuss the issues of naming confusion, comparability, applicability, accuracy trade-offs, and reproducibility of using spectral indices.Overall, this overview provides an extensive list of spectral indices, both soil indices and soil-related indices, that can be useful for characterising these environment components by remote sensing. It draws attention to some misuses and confusions that must be avoided to prevent scientific pitfalls.

 The remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) varies with the illumination and viewing geometry, an effect referred to as anisotropy, bidirectionality, or bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). In the aquatic environment, bidirectionality arises from the anisotropic downwelling illumination, scattered by water and particles in varying proportions as a function of the scattering angle, and modulated by the two-way interaction with the sea surface. For remote sensing applications, it is desirable that the reflectance only depends on the inherent optical properties (IOPs). This process implies transforming Rrs into a “corrected” or “normalized” Rrs,N, referred to the sun at the zenith and the sensor zenith angle at the nadir. A recent review study (D'Alimonte et al., 2025) compared published BRDF methods, showing the better performance of that developed by Lee et al. (2011, henceforth L11) with respect to those proposed by Morel et al. (2002) and Park and Ruddick (2005). This article presents a new method starting from L11's analytical framework, named O25 after OLCI, the Ocean Colour sensor on Sentinel-3 satellite. O25 has been calibrated with a recently published synthetic dataset tailored to its needs (Pitarch and Brando, 2025). A comparative assessment using the same datasets as in D'Alimonte et al. (2025) concludes that O25 outperforms L11 and hence all pre-existing methods. O25 includes complementary operational features: (1) applicability range, (2) uncertainty estimates, and (3) a demonstrated reversibility of the bidirectional correction. O25's look-up tables are generic to any in situ and satellite sensors, including hyperspectral ones. For sensors such as Landsat/Sentinel 2, the IOPs retrieval component of O25 can easily be reformulated."

 The radiometric temperature of the plants is known to be a good indicator of their level of water stress. The use of thermal cameras on board UAVs allows operational monitoring of the canopy temperature in orchard plantations at the single-tree level. The radiometric processing of the flight data becomes critical in this task to maintain the accuracy provided by field measurements using proximal thermal radiometers. This work focuses on evaluating the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) as a good indicator of the plant water status in almond orchards. This study compares the performance of CWSI by three different techniques: i) using proximal high-precision thermal radiometry (CWSI_CIMEL); ii) by UAV thermal flights for canopy temperature assessment (CWSI_UAV) and iii) combining multispectral and thermal data, also by UAV, to run a simplified two-source surface energy balance for the traditional formulation of the CWSI in terms of canopy transpiration (CWSI_STSEB).This study was conducted on two commercials almonds (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb) orchards located in Albacete (SE Spain), one of them with 3 irrigation treatments (well-watered, moderate water stress, and severe water stress). Periodic measurements of stem water potential (SWP) were carried out around noon throughout 3 experimental campaigns from 2019 to 2021. Canopy temperature measurements were made with a high-precision thermal radiometer, the CIMEL CE312-C2. In addition, six flights were carried out using a DJI-M600 drone equipped with a FLIR Tau2 thermal sensor and a Micasense RedEdge camera. Maps of the CWSI were performed during these dates, showing temporal and spatial variability. The three different techniques showed similar CWSI trends across dates and treatments. When treatments were pooled within the same date, the assessment with SWP measurements showed correlations (R2) of 0.86, 0.68, and 0.70 for CWSI_CIMEL, CWSI_UAV, and CWSI_STSEB, respectively. These results reinforce the potential of accurate measurements of radiometric canopy temperatures using both proximal and remote sensing techniques to reproduce the crop water status in almond orchards. However, this study points to the necessity for accurate sensor calibrations and an appropriate methodology for the treatment of both canopy temperature and meteorological data. Monitoring CWSI serves as an operational tool for the early detection of water deficits in almond trees and meets farmerś needs to improve water use efficiency and optimize irrigation scheduling at the plot level."

 Sufficient abundance and variety of field site sampling are crucial for obtaining an accurate reach-scale river classification of a regional stream network in support of scientific research and river management. However, many studies still randomly select field sites or only visit accessible streams. This leads to an inadequate exploration of stream characteristics, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate classification. Machine learning has been recognized for discovering and extracting streams’ geomorphic patterns efficiently and accurately from data, but its application in field site sampling design is still in its infancy. This study developed a general and practical field site selection framework by incorporating machine learning in a human-in-the-loop manner. This framework includes three steps: (1) initial field site selection via machine learning from prior datasets, (2) selected field site accessibility evaluation and observation, and (3) additional field site decision and selection via an iterative learning process. In an example application to the San Francisco Bay Area (California, USA), our framework extracted representative geomorphic characteristics of (i) previous known stream types from prior labeled and geospatial datasets and (ii) previously unrecognized stream types based on uncertainty information obtained by machine learning. Moreover, we propose methods for replacing inaccessible sites to ensure sufficient information is retained in the selected field sites. Results revealed clear differences in variable distributions between the 148 high‐certainty sites and the 51 high‐uncertainty sites, a pattern that was validated by our field surveys. Furthermore, the 41 newly identified high‐uncertainty sites were found under-represented in the initial surveyed sites and thus their selection for the next round of field surveys will help fill the important feature gaps left by the initial survey. The feasibility of this framework allows river scientists and land use decision-makers to better understand river patterns and manage spatial planning."

 As a key precursor of radicals and ozone (O3), formaldehyde (HCHO) affects the atmospheric oxidative capacity of the troposphere. Herein, we investigated seasonal variation of HCHO levels, sources, sinks, and its impact on O3 based on 17-month online measurements of HCHO and other trace gases at an urban site in Beijing. The average mixing ratio of HCHO during the warm season was 6.09 ± 3.37 ppbv, marking an increase of approximately 50 % compared to the cold season. During the warm season, HCHO accounted for 26.6 ± 6.9 % of the average mixing ratio and 34.6 ± 8.3 % of the OH reactivity for total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), approximately double the levels observed in 2011. The positive matrix factorization analysis reveals that photochemical production accounted for 71.4 % of the average HCHO level during the warm season, while vehicular exhaust contributed 50.6 % during the cold season. A budget analysis of HCHO production (PHCHO) and destruction (DHCHO) rates using a box model based on observations (OBM) shows that during the daytime in the warm season, PHCHO was close to DHCHO, suggesting a near closure of the HCHO budget. During the cold season, DHCHO surpassed PHCHO, possibly driven by primary emissions. The dominant HCHO production pathways were reactions of alkoxyl radicals with oxygen, while its major destruction processes were the reaction with OH radical and self-photolysis during both seasons. The relative incremental reactivity (RIR) values of nitrogen oxides determined using the OBM were negative during the summer. However, these values showed a significant increase from 2011 to 2022, indicating that while O3 production in urban Beijing was primarily VOC-limited, the influence of NO titration on O3 decreased over the decade. The RIR value of HCHO increased by 50 % from 2011 to 2022. Moreover, in 2022, HCHO has become the second most important VOC for O3 formation, following isoprene. This underscores its crucial role in shaping future O3 control measures."

 BackgroundAlthough the link between air pollution and lung cancer is well established, recent evidence from low-pollution areas is mixed. We investigated the association of long-term exposure to air pollution with lung cancer incidence in Denmark.MethodsWe analyzed data from 28,731 female nurses in the Danish Nurse Cohort, followed from 1993/1999 until 2020 for lung cancer incidence. We estimated residential annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC), and ozone (O3) using the DEHM/UBM/AirGIS modelling system. Time-varying Cox regression models evaluated the associations between these exposures and lung cancer incidence.ResultsAfter excluding participants who did not meet the criteria for our study, we were left with 23,706 participants, 450 of whom developed lung cancer during the study period. The mean PM2.5, PM10, NO2, BC, and O3 concentrations at the participants' baseline addresses were 14.65, 21.02, 20.25, 0.92, and 50.77 μg/m3, respectively. Our study found no association between the pollutants investigated and lung cancer incidence. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals for lung cancer incidence associated with 5-year moving average exposures to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, BC, and O3 were 0.95 (0.75–1.20) per 2.68 μg/m3, 0.93 (0.78–1.12) per 2.81 μg/m3, 0.95 (0.83–1.08) per 7.98 μg/m3, 0.96 (0.86–1.08) per 0.34 μg/m3, and 1.05 (0.90–1.21) per 7.04 μg/m3, respectively, in the fully adjusted model.

 Quantitative understanding of temporal distribution of submicron-charged particles is essential for estimating both the radiative forcing and the efficiency of particle deposition in human airways. To elucidate their behavior in the atmosphere, the number concentrations of charged and non-charged particles were measured at Noto Peninsula, Japan, to estimate the charge distribution of submicron atmospheric particles using a system that combines a parallel-plate particle separator and optical particle counters. The average charge number (pave) of particles and standard deviation (1σ) were obtained by fitting the particle charge distribution with a Gaussian distribution, representing the shift toward positive or negative and width broadening of the distribution, respectively. During summer, the particle charge distribution shifted toward the negative and the width increased. This change was likely due to collisions with negative cluster ions originating from the local vegetation and the Pacific Ocean under conditions of high negative polar conductivity in the atmosphere. During winter, the pave values were close to zero, and the width decreased. This change may arise from the balanced atmospheric electrical conductivity. The number concentrations of negatively charged and non-charged particles increased in summer and winter, respectively; their chemical compositions were primarily organic matter and sulfate, respectively. The pave values changed with the atmospheric electric field and atmospheric electrical conductivity ratio, indicating high production of submicron-sized charged particles owing to field charging.

 To quantitatively characterize atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in a key agricultural region, dry and bulk N deposition were measured at five sites (Fuzhou, Taining, Shanghang, Changting, and Wuyishan), in Fujian province of southeastern China over the past decade. Dry deposition of ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was estimated using the influential method, multiplying gaseous N concentrations by the deposition velocity simulated using the GEOS-Chem model. For bulk deposition the amounts of NH4+-N and NO3−-N were obtained by multiplying the N concentrations in rainwater by the precipitation amount. Long-term in situ observations (from 2010 to 2020) indicated that bulk N deposition decreased by 17.4 % during the monitoring period. Notably, from 2016 to 2020, total N deposition significantly decreased by 22.2 %, with an average value of 27.5 ± 1.23 kg N ha−1 yr−1. This was mostly caused by a reduction in reduced N deposition. N deposition exhibited distinct seasonal variability, determined by the amount of precipitation: dry deposition reached its peak in autumn, whereas bulk deposition was at its highest in spring and summer. The ratios of reduced to oxidized N in dry deposition, bulk deposition, and total N deposition were 3.23, 1.03, and 1.39, respectively, indicating a strong influence of agricultural sources. Our results show that atmospheric N deposition is a significant source of N to cropland and surrounding forest ecosystems in Fujian province. As such, it should be incorporated into N management strategies for crop cultivation to achieve sustainable agricultural and ecological protection."

 The positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) acts as a key precursor to La Niña formation, yet the dynamical interactions between pIOD and concurrent El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases remain insufficiently understood. Through an analysis of reanalysis datasets and simulations from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LENS), this study demonstrates that 64.2 % of observed pIOD events coincide with concurrent El Niño, aligning with a frequency of 57.1 % in CESM-LENS simulations. The probability of subsequent La Niña development following pIOD-El Niño coexistence reaches 54.7 % in reanalysis data and 59.0 % in CESM-LENS simulations, escalating to 75.6 % for intense pIOD episodes and 82.5 % under conditions of concurrent strong El Niño events. Spatiotemporal analysis reveals distinct transition mechanisms governed by Pacific background states. During periods of pIOD-El Niño coexistence, oceanic advection (51.7 %) works synergistically with surface heat flux (22.2 %) to collectively dissipate warm anomalies. In contrast, under pIOD-Neutral conditions, intensified zonal advection (61.7 %) predominantly facilitates cooling processes. Two key findings emerge from this analysis: (1) The intensity of the pIOD directly modulates both the likelihood and magnitude of subsequent La Niña, with stronger initial pIOD substantially enhance development probabilities; (2) Concurrent ENSO states determine the dominant physical drivers at play—El Niño coexistence enabling a multi-mechanism cooling while Neutral conditions necessitate accelerated advective processes. These findings demonstrate that combinations of pIOD-ENSO phases create distinct thermodynamic pathways for initiating La Niña events, carrying significant implications for seasonal forecasting. The identified intensity-dependent relationships and phase-specific mechanisms provide a framework for improving climate predictability, particularly under evolving climate conditions that may alter tropical basin interactions."

 A new assimilation module for AGRI (Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager) carried on Fengyun-4B (FY-4B) is developed within the WRFDA (Weather Research and Forecasting model's Data Assimilation) system. The impacts of assimilating FY-4B AGRI clear-sky and all-sky data are evaluated with cycling assimilation experiments for the typhoon Doksuri (2023) and Talim (2023) forecast. For typhoon Doksuri, compared with the benchmark experiment, AGRI assimilation brings a better analysis and forecast for atmospheric variables (wind, temperature and humidity). Meanwhile, clear error reductions for typhoon track and intensity forecasts are achieved with clear-sky and all-sky AGRI assimilation. The positive impact on landing precipitation prediction is also obtained by verifying with GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) precipitation data. Moreover, AGRI all-sky assimilation yields better typhoon forecasts than clear-sky assimilation. In addition, the channel selection sensitivity for AGRI assimilation is also assessed with group experiments. It is suggested that with the assimilation of a new water vapor channel at 7.42 μm, which is newly added in FY-4B, multiple-channel assimilation shows greater benefit for forecast than single-channel assimilation. The same positive impact of AGRI assimilation is also present in typhoon Talim (2023) forecast.

 The rainy season in South China is predominantly influenced by monsoon and tropical cyclone (TC) weather systems. However, due to the lack of long-term observational data, the microphysical characteristics of raindrop size distributions (DSDs) associated with these systems remain insufficiently understood. This study utilizes five years (2016–2020) of 2DVD observations to analyze the differences in DSD characteristics of monsoon and TC rainfall. The results indicate that monsoon rainfall exhibits higher concentrations of medium to large raindrops (diameter > 2.1 mm), along with larger mean rainfall rates (R) and mass-weighted mean diameters (Dm), but lower normalized intercept parameters (Nw) compared to TC rainfall. Distinct differences in the mean normalized DSDs are observed between monsoon and TC rainfall. Convective rain under both systems shows the characteristics of maritime convective rain. Additionally, the relationships between kinetic energy (KE) and R, KE and Dm, as well as radar reflectivity (Z) and R, differ between monsoon and TC rainfall. TC events have relatively humid atmospheric conditions and higher wind speeds, resulting in the presence of a large number of small raindrops. These findings enhance understanding of the DSD characteristics under different synoptic regimes and provide valuable implications for improving rainfall KE estimation, DSD retrieval, and quantitative precipitation estimation over South China."

In particular, we characterize a population of neuropeptide Y (NPY)–expressing neurons surrounding LC noradrenergic cells. We show that this peri-LCNPYpopulation exerts neuromodulatory inhibitory control over the LC via NPY-Y1R signaling. Under naïve conditions, this results in bidirectional control of anxiety-like behaviors. Stressful experiences recruit peri-LCNPYneurons, leading to local NPY release in vivo, whereas enhanced peri-LCNPYneuronal activity curbs anxiety after stress. Together, we establish a causal role for peri-LCNPY–mediated neuromodulation of the LC in the regulation of anxiety, providing mechanistic insights into the endogenous systems underlying adaptive responses to adversity."

The predominant approach, single photon counting, sets stringent requirements on low x-ray flux and signal discrimination and prolongs imaging time. Here, we report on the design of unipolar n-i-n perovskite detectors for multienergy x-ray imaging. Systematic characterization validates electrons dominating carrier dynamics in detectors, and the distribution of generated electrons varies as x-ray energy along its penetrating direction, whereas working voltage can manipulate electron drift length, ensuring their selective collection for x-ray energy discrimination. Our multienergy imaging array adopts high-flux x-ray in a normal imaging system and realizes fast 4-energy-bins x-ray images. By introducing the σ(Ei)/σ(Ej)-related multienergy digital subtraction algorithm, the images successfully distinguish the substance of targets side by side or by stacking, representing a notable advancement over conventional energy-integration imaging technique."

Behaviorally, manipulating VIP neuronal activity left probabilistic classical conditioning unaffected but severely impaired reversal learning. Physiologically, conditioned cue-associated VIP neuronal responses changed abruptly after encountering an unexpected reward. They also conveyed strong reward prediction error signals during behavioral reversal, but not before or after, unlike pyramidal neurons that consistently conveyed error signals throughout all phases. Furthermore, the signal’s persistence across trials correlated with reversal learning duration. These results suggest that mPFC VIP neurons play crucial roles in rapid reversal learning, but not in gradual value updating under stable probabilistic contingencies, by monitoring salient deviations from ongoing environmental contingencies and imposing error-correction signals during behavioral adjustments. These findings shed light on the intricate cortical circuit dynamics underpinning behavioral flexibility in complex, multifaceted environments."

The moderate success of patch-scale biodiversity conservation measures has led to the concept of creating biodiversity-friendly landscapes. However, these landscapes potentially present a paradox: They may increase local biodiversity and thereby strengthen biotic resistance of native communities to global change winners, i.e., species that thrive under global change, such as invasive alien species or temperature- or nutrient-tolerant species. However, they may also improve landscape-scale habitat conditions, such as habitat connectivity, which facilitates the dispersal of global change winners, thereby accelerating biodiversity loss. Despite increasing investment in biodiversity-friendly landscapes, this paradox and underlying processes remain largely unquantified. We analyzed 2050 repeated, systematic vegetation surveys across the Swiss farmland and found the hypothesized facilitating and inhibitory effects on global change winners, but, overall, the inhibitory effects were stronger. This supports the call for a shift from patch-scale conservation to landscape-wide strategies to stop the ongoing decline of farmland biodiversity."

TheQfactor exhibits an inverse-square dependence on perturbation strength, consistent with the behavior of quasi-bound states in the continuum. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate chiral modes with high circular dichroism, large separation angles, and high-Qfactors. We further couple 2D excitons to these resonant modes, achieving spatially separated chiral emission.

During calcification, we observed a range of structures, from small electron-dense bodies within larger compartments to denser and distributed globular compartments, before returning to small bodies once scale formation is complete. Nanobeam-scanning x-ray fluorescence measurements further revealed that these electron-dense bodies are rich in phosphorus and calcium (molar ratio of ~4:1).

Reduction of CCR2+TAMs enhances antitumor immunity and improves chemotherapeutic response. PF/GEM@mPLV markedly inhibits tumor recurrence following iIRE, diminishes hepatic metastases, and prolongs survival in preclinical PDAC models.

Beyond mRNA,FUSgenerates partially processed transcripts retaining introns 6 and 7. We demonstrate that these FUSint6&7-RNA molecules form nuclear condensates, scaffolded by the highly structured intron 7 and associated with nuclear speckles. Using hybridization-proximity labeling proteomics, we show that the FUSint6&7-RNA condensates are enriched for splicing factors and the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader YTHDC1. These ribonucleoprotein structures facilitate posttranscriptional FUS splicing and depend on m6A/YTHDC1 for integrity. In cells expressing mutant FUS, FUSint6&7-RNAs become hypermethylated, which in turn stimulates their condensation and splicing. We further show that FUS protein is repelled by m6A. Thus, ALS-FUS mutations may cause abnormal activation of FUS posttranscriptional splicing through altered RNA methylation. Notably, ectopic expression of FUS intron 7 sequences dissolves endogenous FUSint6&7-RNA condensates, down-regulating FUS mRNA and protein.

Here, we present a starfish-inspired tube foot composed of a soft hydrogel mouth and a rigid stem, fabricated by integrating two serially bonded cylindrical components with distinct mechanical properties. Upon swelling, the initially straight hydrogel cylinder undergoes a selective shape transformation into a soft, cupped pad that deforms to stretch and spread upon contact, enabling effective adhesion to target surfaces. During detachment, a vacuum is formed within the tube, leading to strong underwater adhesion. The artificial tube feet show high adhesion hysteresis, autonomous release by external stimuli, and immediate detachment by pneumatic actuation with integrated system. The temporary underwater adhesive inspired by the tube feet of starfish enables functionality in underwater robotics and is demonstrated through underwater manipulation of rocks."

In solid-state NMR (SSNMR), resolution is primarily constrained by instrumentation rather than molecular tumbling, making it well suited for studying large and complex systems. To fully leverage UHF magnets for SSNMR, it is essential to eliminate line broadening arising from magnetic field drift and couplings among the nuclear spins. We address these challenges using external2H lock to compensate for the field drift and long-observation-window band-selective homonuclear decoupling to suppress13C homonuclear couplings. We achieve better than 0.2–parts per million resolution in proteins up to 144 kilodalton, enabling unique site resolution for more than 500 amide backbone pairs in two-dimensional experiments. This exceeds the resolution available from solution NMR for large biological molecules, greatly expanding the potential of gigahertz-class NMR for research in life sciences."

This study reveals that citrate, glutamine, and magnesium synergistically activate both pathways via calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2)– and protein kinase B (Akt)–dependent signaling, bypassing the traditional adenosine monophosphate (AMP)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensing mechanism. This dual activation supports sustained energy metabolism during osteogenesis and challenges the canonical antagonism between mTORC1 and AMPK. We developed CitraBoneQMg, a citrate-based biomaterial incorporating these components via one-pot synthesis. CitraBoneQMg provides sustained release, photoluminescent and photoacoustic imaging capabilities, and tunable mechanical properties. In vitro, it promotes osteogenesis by enhancing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteogenic gene expression, and calcium deposition. In vivo, it accelerates bone regeneration in a rat calvarial defect model while promoting anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative responses. We define this integrated effect as “metabotissugenesis,” offering a metabolically optimized approach to orthopedic biomaterial design."

Using task-free magnetoencephalography in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, as well as unrelated individuals, we found that neurophysiological traits were significantly more similar between monozygotic twins, indicating a genetic influence, although individual-specific variability remained predominant. These heritable brain dynamics were mainly associated with genes involved in neurotransmission, expressed along a topographical gradient that mirrors psychological functions, including attention, planning, and emotional processes. Furthermore, the cortical expression patterns of genes associated with individual differentiation aligned most strongly with gene expression profiles observed during adulthood in previously published longitudinal datasets.

This work introduces nonfused, flexible sulfur segments (SSs) into the polymer’s backbone to enhance hydrophilicity and active site access. Unlike rigid, fused sulfone moieties, our flexible SS improves interfacial water contact and charge transport. P-2SO2, with sulfone-functionalized SS, represents a 237% improvement over the control polymer, PBDTTSO. In addition, P-2SO2demonstrated an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 1060.1 micromoles per hour and an apparent quantum yield of 32.4% (460 nanometers). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate SS improves hydrophilicity and water/polymer interface while promoting a hairpin-like conformation that increases intrachain π-π stacking for better charge hopping.

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed peripheral injury–induced changes in genetic pathways involved in axonal and presynaptic organization in nociceptive BLA neurons. Next, we identified a previously uncharacterized nociceptive hotspot in the nucleus accumbens shell that is innervated by BLA nociceptive neurons. Axonal calcium imaging of BLA projections to the accumbens and chemogenetic inhibition of this pathway revealed pain-related transmission from the amygdala to the medial nucleus accumbens, facilitating both acute and chronic pain affective-motivational behaviors.

Using hyperspectral imaging, multispectral photography, microspectrophotometry, reflectance spectrophotometry, and optical modeling, we show that hidden white and black feather layers are systematically distributed on the body to enhance the brightness and saturation of carotenoid-pigmented and structurally colored plumage, respectively, by increasing or decreasing the amount of backscattered light that interacts with pigments or nanostructures. We compare male and female coloration and show that sexual dichromatism in someTangaracarotenoid plumage stems primarily from white layers in males and black layers in females rather than from differences in carotenoid pigmentation.

However, we lack observations of these features due to their small size and fast evolution. Here, we present in situ observations of one such cyclonic eddy with intense chlorophyll at its center as it spontaneously splits into two smaller cyclonic eddies over a few days. This splitting rapidly transports surface waters to depth, with sustained vertical velocities of 60 meters per day, primarily from the center of the eddy where carbon concentrations are largest, facilitating efficient transfer of phytoplankton carbon to depth, below the well-mixed, sunlit surface layer. We reproduce the splitting process in an idealized ocean model and find that splitting is controlled by the initial elliptical eddy shape, size, and intensity. Our observations uncover a mechanism for subduction in the upper ocean and highlight the need for quantifying its global prevalence."
