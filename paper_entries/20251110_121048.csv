The impact was measured by running two large sets of 32‐day ensemble re‐forecasts over the extended winter periods from 2020 to 2023 which were initialized from an analysis with or without GNSS‐RO assimilated. Results indicate a difference of 4 m/s in zonal wind at the equator in the two analyses and a statistically significant improvement in the reforecast skill scores up to week 4 in the stratosphere, particularly over the Tropics when assimilating GNSS‐RO. The impact in the troposphere is generally negligible. However, the amplitude of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is significantly stronger during the first 2 weeks when the reforecasts are initialized from the analysis with GNSS‐RO assimilated, suggesting a potential link between MJO prediction and the initialization of the stratosphere."

Using CLM5.0 sensitivity experiments with ± $\pm $50% nighttime precipitation perturbations (HALF and PLUS50) and fixed precipitation variability (FIX1979), we show that nighttime precipitation anomalies modulate soil moisture, repartition turbulent and ground heat fluxes and, during daytime, alter surface albedo. HALF and FIX1979 amplify land surface temperature (LST) warming by 0.07°C decade−1 and 0.17°C decade−1, respectively; PLUS50 reduces it by 0.06°C decade−1. LST warming sensitivity peaks over arid/semi‐arid regions and is offset responses in semi‐humid regions. The response is diurnally asymmetric: daytime LST is jointly controlled by evapotranspiration and albedo anomalies, whereas nighttime LST is dominated by changes in turbulent and ground heat fluxes. These results establish nighttime precipitation and its variability as key regulators of high terrain surface warming and demonstrate that hourly‐resolved diagnostics are essential for evaluating diurnally varying land‐atmosphere coupling."

It also examines the added value of finer grid spacing, which enables the explicit representation of deep convection. Simulations were conducted at grid spacings of 0.11° (≈12 km) and 0.0225° (≈2.5 km), and the results were compared with surface observations from 35 hydrometeorological stations across Quebec over two cold seasons (October to April in 2020–21 and 2021–22). The analysis was further supported by atmospheric sounding data from two stations, and several gridded reference products. Both simulations exhibited similar large‐scale 2‐m air temperature spatial patterns with the coarser‐resolution simulation generating consistently colder values as well as a larger total precipitation amount and bias compared to station observations. The finer‐resolution simulation reduced the total precipitation bias by a factor of three. Both simulations overestimated liquid precipitation and underestimated solid precipitation with the finer resolution better capturing liquid precipitation and the coarser resolution better capturing solid precipitation. Mixed precipitation remained a challenge, being simulated at colder temperatures than observed, particularly near 0°C. The 50% rain‐snow temperature threshold (T50), which indicates when liquid and solid phases occur equally, was 0.5°C for the finer resolution and 0.8°C for the coarser resolution both below the observed 2.1°C. This study highlights the need to refine the model's representation of mixed‐phase precipitation and rain‐snow transitions."

This event brought frontal snow, strong winds, and sub‐zero temperatures, leading to significant blowing snow (BLSN) conditions in the Red River Valley and causing widespread disruption. This research provides a detailed analysis of the meteorological phenomena on 12 February, with a focus on BLSN dynamics. We employed a BLSN algorithm based on the PIEKTUK‐D model, coupled with the Polar Weather Research and Forecasting (PWRF) model. Simulations were conducted using lateral boundary conditions from the 0.25° Global Forecast System analysis data. We evaluated basic meteorological parameters, such as temperature, wind, and relative humidity, alongside specialized parameters like snow water equivalent. Simulated BLSN features match well to the features observed in GOES‐16 images. The most significant impact of incorporating the BLSN algorithm in PWRF is observed in the vertical distribution of relative humidity. A notable outcome of this research is the successful implementation of the BLSN code to calculate visibility, which can be particularly useful during blizzard conditions."

In the stratosphere, the minor oxygen CO2 isotopologues have anomalous abundances due to their exchange reactions with isotopically fractionated ozone, differentiating them from tropospheric CO2. Previously a model predicted that this anomalous isotopic abundance continues into the mesosphere but lacked verification from experimental observations. Here we use the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer which records infrared transmittance spectra of the Earth's limb from low Earth orbit using solar occultation. These infrared spectra provide measurements of global CO2 isotopologue volume mixing ratios (VMRs) from the upper troposphere to the lower thermosphere.

Zhang,Environmental and Boundary Layer Characteristics Associated With Intensity Change of Tropical Cyclones Under High Fullness,"Tropical cyclone (TC) fullness, which measures the ratio of the annular width of the vortex skirt region to the total width of the outer wind field, is an important metric for characterizing TC wind structure and intensity change. High fullness is typically beneficial for intensification, but there are situations where high‐fullness TCs do not intensify. This study explores the structural characteristics and environmental conditions of weakening TCs under high fullness. Identifying these situations can be helpful for improved prediction of TC intensity change. This study analyzes 5,218 GPS dropsondes from 36 TCs to compare structural and environmental conditions of intensifying (IN) and weakening (WE) TCs under high fullness. For the environmental conditions, TCs tend to weaken with strong southerly vertical wind shear, dry air, and less ocean heat content, suggesting that more adverse conditions are required to offset the favorable effects of high fullness. In terms of structural characteristics, WE TCs have a warmer, moister boundary layer but weaker surface fluxes than IN TCs. Additionally, WE TCs exhibit stronger inward advection of absolute angular momentum within the friction layer. Above the frictional inflow layer, WE TCs display weak outflow, whereas IN TCs exhibit weak inflow. The implications of these differences in surface enthalpy fluxes and radial flow above the friction layer are discussed within the context of recent hypotheses regarding boundary layer ventilation and TC intensification."

Although previous studies have focused on large‐scale circulations driving these events, this study investigates ARs through attributing their moisture sources using the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) with moisture‐tagging capability. Examining ARs in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors of the Arctic separately revealed distinct contributions from remote versus local, and ocean versus land, moisture sources. Unlike non‐AR events, Arctic ARs primarily draw moisture from their respective ocean basins in lower‐latitude regions during the cold season, and shift to land sources in the warm season. Cold‐season ARs in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors source 73.2% and 85.3% of their moisture from their respective ocean basins at lower latitudes, however warm‐season contributions decrease to 41.3% and 29.4%. In contrast, mid‐ and high‐latitude continents combined contribute 40.1% and 51.3% in the warm season. Trajectory clustering analysis shows that AR moisture sources depend on both their genesis regions and transport pathways. In recent decades, the Arctic has experienced a moistening trend in both the cold and warm seasons. Our results suggest that local and remote sources equally drive the observed cold‐season moistening, whereas remote sources predominantly drive the warm‐season moistening. A better understanding of Arctic AR moisture sources under current climate conditions provides valuable insights into their potential future changes amid the projected heterogeneous northern hemispheric warming."

To better understand the diurnal cycle of tropical oceanic rain and cloud cover, the diurnal cycle of deep convective system (DCS) initiation and the subsequent later‐stage accumulation of rainfall resulting from systems initiating at earlier times is analyzed using Lagrangian‐tracked DCSs. The Tracking Of Organized Convection Algorithm through 3D segmentatioN (TOOCAN) DCSs are matched to the Integrated Multi‐satellitE Retrieval for GPM rainfall product and binned by their hour of initiation (in local solar time) to evaluate morphological characteristics and contributions to rain and cloud cover diurnal cycles. Two peaks of DCS initiation are observed: an anticipated overnight peak and an unexpected late morning peak that is earlier than the expected afternoon peak in surface heating. DCSs initiated within the daytime peak have similar morphologies to DCSs initiated overnight and significantly contribute to the afternoon rain and cloud cover likely important for explaining the decreased amplitude of the over‐ocean diurnal cycle. When daytime‐initiated DCSs are excluded from the computation of the precipitation diurnal cycle, we find a closer resemblance to the NASA‐GISS ESM simulated diurnal cycle amplitude, suggesting that daytime DCS initiations may be too few or not maintained in ESMs that exhibit an over‐ocean diurnal cycle amplitude that exceeds observational estimates."

Assessing the climatic impacts of these aerosols requires a detailed understanding of their optical properties and atmospheric abundance. Despite a strong understanding of cooking activities, residential water and space heating emissions in India remain highly uncertain. Using the field measurements, this study quantifies emission factors (EFs) and optical properties of emissions from water and space heating in India. The measured PM2.5, elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC) EFs for heating range between 2.2–20.7, 0.4–2.2, and 0.8–5.5 g kg−1, respectively, are ∼2 fold higher than those for cooking. PM2.5 EFs from firewood (20.7 ± 8.5 g kg−1) are larger than those during the crop residue (7.1 ± 5.7 g kg−1) and dung cake (17.4 ± 9.8 g kg−1) burning for water heating. These emissions exhibit significant absorption, corroborated by low values of single‐scattering albedo at 532 nm ranging from 0.17 to 0.96. A large absorption Angström exponent of 1.34–2.57 suggests the presence of brown carbon. The study estimates emissions of 1,239 (±264), 309 (±88), and 88 (±30) Gg yr−1 for PM2.5, OC, and EC, respectively, from residential heating activities in India. Spatially, emission patterns from heating differ from those for cooking, with high emissions in northern hilly regions, the Indo‐Gangetic plains, and western and southern India. The derived EFs, optical properties, and high‐resolution emissions enhance the understanding of aerosol climate impacts, offering insights for regional mitigation strategies for air pollution."

Here, we model the historical glacio‐hydrology of 2,236 catchments across the Western Patagonia, and project climate change impacts through the 21st century. To this end, we develop a novel modeling framework that combines Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks with ice‐dynamical glacier modeling using the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM). We evaluate the ability of this hybrid framework to predict streamflow in ungauged basins (PUB) and regions (PUR) through 10‐fold cross‐validation and compare the results with those obtained with a LSTM model without a glacier component, and two process‐based coupled glacio‐hydrological models. The hybrid modeling approach outperforms all other approaches in 38% and 44% of the catchments considering PUB and PUR evaluations, respectively. Using our new hybrid approach, we estimate an average regional freshwater flux of 19,815 m3 s−1 for the period 2000–2019, with glacier melt contributing 29% during the summer season. Under a high‐emission scenario (Shared socioeconomic pathways 5‐8.5), the northern region (>46°S) is projected to experience the largest reductions in runoff, with dry season runoff decreasing by almost 50% by the end of the century. In contrast, runoff increases are projected for glacierized basins in the southern regions, with average relative changes of 10%–25% and a marked seasonality shift. The results highlight the potential of hybrid modeling in glacio‐hydrology and provide important information for climate change adaptation in Western Patagonia."

 Snow on sea ice strongly modulates growth, albedo, and air–sea exchange, but it also drives major uncertainties in altimeter-based thickness retrievals. This is critical for Ku-band radar altimeters (e.g., CryoSat-2, CS-2), whose waveforms integrate backscatter from snow-covered sea ice. Contrary to the common assumption that returns originate near the snow–ice interface, complex snow properties (roughness, layering, wetness, ice lenses) can shift effective scattering upward into the snowpack. We analyze Ku-band CS-2 satellite and Ka-band KAREN airborne waveforms over the Weddell Sea to partition contributions from the snow surface, snow volume, and ice surface. Using a physics-based Forward Backscatter Emulation Model (FBEM) and a CNN trained on simulated waveforms, we retrieve geophysical parameters and assess sensitivity to snow conditions. Under typical Antarctic conditions, snow-volume scattering contributes as much as, or more than, the snow–ice interface to CS-2 returns, while Ka-band is dominated by surface/near-surface snow scattering with minimal penetration to the ice surface. Wet snow further amplifies upper-layer backscatter. Sensitivity tests identify volume scattering and ice-surface roughness as primary controls on waveform shape. These results argue for explicit snow-volume terms in waveform models and support dual-frequency strategies relevant to ESA’s upcoming CRISTAL mission.

 The surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect, assessed through remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), remains a focal point in urban climate research. Conventional indicators like SUHI intensity (SUHII) and footprint (SUHIF) capture peak values and spatial extent but fail to account for the cumulative thermal load—a critical dimension reflecting the total heat exposure imposed by spatially continuous warming, which directly limits a holistic assessment of ecological and societal impacts of the SUHI effect. Therefore, this study introduces an indicator termed SUHI capacity (SUHIC), designed to quantify the aggregated SUHI effect by integrating the magnitude of the warming signal across all affected areas, thereby enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of urban thermal environments. Furthermore, a direction-enhanced adaptive synchronous extraction (DEASE) method is proposed for the quantification of SUHIC. This method can dynamically identify the optimal background reference area based on the urban-rural LST gradients in various directions within the city, without relying on predefined mathematical models as previously. The results from 102 European cities first confirm that the directional variations in urban-rural LST gradients, and the DEASE method can effectively capture these distinctions for the simultaneous estimation of SUHII, SUHIF, and SUHIC. Secondly, the spatial patterns of absolute SUHIC values show strong associations with those of SUHIF (R2 > 0.86), while its relative values (normalized by the area of urban) align more closely with SUHII (R2 > 0.64). More importantly, SUHIC can serve as a crucial reference for assessing the urban thermal signal when SUHII and SUHIF diverge. The proposed method and framework contribute to standardizing the quantification of the SUHI effect."

 This paper investigates morphodynamics of a macrotidal gravel beach (Etretat, Normandy, NW France) during two consecutive winter seasons characterized by moderate (2018–2019) and exceptionally energetic (2019–2020) conditions according to a 42-year analysis of hindcasted wave data. Upper intertidal beach changes and shoreline data were derived from a video monitoring system. The results show that storm impacts were strongly influenced by the storm characteristics, the tide phasing, and more importantly, by the pre-existing conditions of the beach before the impact of the storms. A multiple regression including wave height and tide range during the storm event explained 46% of the variance of the volume change due to storm events.

 Eutrophication has become a persistent environmental challenge in the Mid-Lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB), influencing both water security and regional sustainability. Remote sensing provides an effective approach for retrieving chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla). However, due to the limited spatial and temporal coverage of satellite observations and inconsistencies among satellite sensors, long-term variations in Chla across the MLYRB have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to fill this gap by generating a four-decade (1984–2024) Chla dataset for lakes and reservoirs larger than 1 km2 in the MLYRB using Landsat imagery. In this study, Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI imagery were used to develop a machine learning approach based on the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to estimate Chla, calibrated with 235 synchronized satellite and in situ measurements. The model showed strong performance on the testing dataset (R2 = 0.78, RMSLE = 0.21, AURE = 29.6 %) and was subsequently applied to reconstruct annual Chla maps for lakes and reservoirs across the MLYRB from 1984 to 2024. The reconstructed results revealed that Chla were highest in the Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake sub-basins (27.9 ± 2.5 and 27.8 ± 2.7 mg/m3, respectively) and lowest in the Han River and Taihu Lake sub-basins (22.7 ± 2.5 and 22.8 ± 2.1 mg/m3). Spatially, Chla distribution was strongly correlated with precipitation and temperature, which together accounted for 72.4 % of the spatial variability. A distinct transition occurred between 2005 and 2007, when mean Chla peaked at 27.6 ± 8.5 mg/m3 and the overall trend shifted from fluctuating increases to a decline. Temporally, Chla variations were largely associated with, meteorological factors, particularly nighttime light (NTL) and gross domestic product (GDP), explaining 65 % of the temporal variability. This study presents the first nearly four-decade Landsat-derived Chla dataset for lakes and reservoirs larger than 1 km2 in the MLYRB. This long-term dataset offers critical support for understanding water quality dynamics and guiding evidence-based environmental management in eastern plains of China."

 Strict emission-control measures in China have markedly reduced anthropogenic emissions and improved air quality, yet their impacts remain insufficiently quantified. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) together with multiple linear regression (MLR), this study quantified the respective contributions of emission reductions and meteorological conditions to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in January and July during 2015–2024, and evaluated how emission reductions affect meteorological variability and boundary-layer stability. Both WRF-Chem and MLR attributed the observed PM2.5 declines primarily to emission reductions rather than meteorological conditions. Over the North China Plain, WRF-Chem attributed PM2.5 declines of −3.9/−1.8 μg m−3 yr−1 for January/July to emission reductions, whereas MLR yielded −6.3/−4.9 μg m−3 yr−1. Emission reductions increased clear-sky surface shortwave radiation by 0.36 W m−2 yr−1 in January and 0.32 W m−2 yr−1 in July, accompanied by modest increases in near-surface temperature, boundary-layer height, and sensible and latent heat fluxes, and by decreases in relative humidity. In Beijing, reduced aerosols produced surface warming in January with slight cooling at 900−950 hPa, whereas July exhibited warming below 850 hPa, increasing near-surface temperature gradients and enhancing boundary-layer instability."

 Tropical cyclone (TC) genesis projections remain a significant challenge in the context of climate change, primarily due to the intricate interactions between large-scale environmental factors. This paper presents a deep learning-based model designed to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of TC genesis in the western North Pacific under climate change. The model, built on an innovative convolutional architecture incorporating spatial and channel mixing techniques, generates heatmaps of TC genesis using key environmental variables, including sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear, low-level relative vorticity, humidity, and temperature. This model outperforms traditional convolutional neural networks in TC genesis predictions. Model projections suggest a weak long-term decline in tropical cyclone frequency across the western North Pacific over the 21st century. Vertical wind shear and low-level vorticity are key factors governing the accuracy of TC genesis predictions. In high-emission scenarios, TC frequency in the South China Sea is projected to increase. Despite uncertainties in climate model simulations, the proposed model provides valuable insights into the response of TC genesis to anthropogenic warming, offering a new framework for future climate risk assessments."
