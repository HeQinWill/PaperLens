While many studies have analyzed spring precipitation in southeastern China and Bengal, their interconnections and implications for the summer monsoon have remained relatively under explored. We utilized the Empirical Orthogonal Function of spring precipitation to reveal Synchronous Spring Precipitation (SSP) in southeastern China and Bengal. This synchronicity is bridged by the East Asian Subtropical Jet (EASJ) that extends from Bengal to southeastern China. The EASJ was predominantly correlated with precipitation in southeastern China prior to the 1990s, while it developed a more profound connection with precipitation in Bengal after the 1990s. Notably, SSP anomalies occurred during the developing phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The predictive capacity of SSP for the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) amplifies during periods of the intensified SSP-ENSO correlations and positive phase of the North Pacific Meridional Mode. Tree-ring based reconstructions spanning the past two centuries further corroborate the persistent linkages among the SSP, ISM, and ENSO. Our research sheds light on the intricate interplay of these factors and their significance in understanding and predicting the monsoon dynamics in the region."

Potential predictors were initially identified based on the relationships between the year-by-year variation (DY) of the TYFs and preseason (March–May) environmental factors. These predictors were subsequently further refined, resulting in the selection of eight key predictors. Prediction models were constructed using twenty machine learning algorithms, utilizing data from 1965 to 2010. These trained models were then applied to perform hindcasts of TYFs from 2011 to 2023. The forecasted DY was added to the observed TYF of the preceding year to obtain the current year’s TYF. The results indicate that the TYFs predicted by the multi-model ensemble (MME) closely align with the observation during the hindcast period. Compared to individual models, the MME improves the prediction skill for the DY by at least 5.56% and up to 56.92%. Furthermore, the mean bias of the MME for TYF is notably smaller than that of the ECMWF’s most recent seasonal forecasting system (SEAS5) in the years of 2017‒2023. The superior performance of the ensemble prediction approach was also validated through leave-one-out cross-validation. This research underscores the potential of ensemble prediction approach utilizing multiple machine learning algorithms to improve the forecasting skill of TYF over the WNP."

Traditionally, these influences are identified using numerical sensitivity experiments with numerical models like the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which require substantial computational resources. This study investigates the potential of the Artificial intelligence (AI)-based Pangu-Weather model to reveal these complex mechanisms by comparing its performance with the WRF model, focusing on Typhoon Khanun’s impact on the extreme rainfall event in North China from 29 July to 1 August 2023. Our analysis shows that Pangu-Weather effectively captures key atmospheric systems and TC positions, outperforming WRF. Specifically, WRF simulations excluding Khanun demonstrate a reduction in northward moisture transport on the eastern side of North China, but minimal impact on the extreme precipitation area for most of the period. Pangu-Weather successfully reproduces these processes, aligning closely with WRF at larger scales (e.g. greater than 300 km). However, Pangu-Weather struggles to discern and explain smaller-scale processes (e.g. less than 300 km). These findings highlight Pangu-Weather’s potential to advance meteorological research and disaster prevention, demonstrating AI’s capability to accurately depict complex large-scale physical processes."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7040,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了气候变化对全球主要粮食产区（“面包篮”地区）作物产量的影响。研究者通过分析过去六十年来的作物产量数据，发现尽管极端高温对作物产量构成了越来越大的威胁，但降水、极端低温天数和平均生长季温度的变化在一定程度上抵消了这种影响。因此，总体而言，气候因素导致的作物产量波动在过去几十年中有所下降。然而，论文也指出，气候因素在近年来对作物产量波动的影响越来越大，这表明极端气候事件对全球粮食生产体系的稳定性至关重要。,"['crop yield', 'climate change', 'breadbasket regions', 'abiotic stress', 'statistical models']",Xuan Chen;Weston Anderson;Liangzhi You;Edward Pope,Observed trends in multiple breadbasket yield shocks,"Extreme climate events in breadbasket regions have become more frequent due to climate change, exposing crops to a greater frequency and intensity of abiotic stress. But by using observed crop yield statistics and an ensemble of statistical models, we demonstrate that over the last six decades the frequency of crop yield shocks in breadbasket regions has been decreasing due to both climate and non-climate factors. Here non-climate factors refer to interannual variability unrelated to abiotic stress, such as biotic stress and management decisions. We find that although the risk posed by extreme heat to crop yields has been increasing, this risk has been offset by changes to precipitation, extremely cold days, and average growing season temperature in many breadbaskets. As a result, total climate-related crop yield shocks have been decreasing for soybeans and wheat, while they have remained roughly constant for maize. Meanwhile, non-climate risks to crop yields have decreased in nearly every breadbasket region across crops. Because non-climate risks have decreased faster than climate risks, we find that the climate accounts for a greater proportion of crop yield shocks in the recent period (1991–2020) compared to an earlier period (1961–90). Our results indicate that extreme climate events are more important than ever to the relative stability of the food production system, even as the overall frequency of multiple breadbasket yield shocks decreases."

Traditionally, ENSO has been considered a phenomenon that is mostly influenced by the interactions between oceanic and atmospheric processes, i.e. by the internal variability in Earth’s ocean-atmosphere system. However, dendrochronological records of climate indices, ENSO among them, have statistically significant variance at periodicities related to solar activity (sunspots) and lunar precessions. Other studies indicate a modulation by the lunar nodal cycle of ocean’s mixing and its implications on water and air temperatures, steric sea levels, coastal flooding, rain, river discharge and heat transport. Those findings suggest that astronomic forces may influence ENSO. In fact, this study shows that a fit to well-established periodicities from lunar precessions, solar activity and their interactions explains 91% of the variance of an ENSO index smoothed at 5 years, and 67% of a 3 yr filtered ENSO index. Provided that the future Earth’s ocean-atmospheric system remains roughly within historical bounds under a changing climate in the next 2–3 decades, one can venture a projection into the future of 3- and 5 yr smoothed ENSO variability. Such projection is given here and might help in preparations for adaptation and mitigation measures caused by ENSO-related coastal hazards."

The extent to which these large-scale initiatives are actually achieving their multiple and potentially conflicting objectives, however, is largely unknown. Sembrando Vida, a national initiative in Mexico implemented in 2019, pays smallholder farmers to plant agroforests in order to reduce poverty and forest loss, and protect biodiversity. We assessed to what degree program recruitment met its stated objectives via its selection of participating municipalities and households. Because program data are not publicly available, we consolidated and harmonized >14 million policy payments (totaling ∼$4 billion USD) to smallholder farmers, thus creating the first spatiotemporal dataset of program outcomes. We found that ∼450k rural households in ∼1000 municipalities across the country participated in the program consistently from 2019 to 2022. The program was reasonably well targeted to achieve its poverty reduction objectives. Significantly more households (ANOVA, p < 0.001) were enrolled in high-poverty (10.4%) than low-poverty (4.9%) municipalities, despite more money being transferred in absolute terms to low-poverty municipalities. The program did not reach some regions that best fit its three goals. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial model, we showed that the distribution of participating households was more likely to address poverty (coefficient = 0.51, p < 0.001 at household level) and forest cover loss (0.1, p = 0.01) than to restore areas important for biodiversity (−0.08, p = 0.02). Finally, we conducted a spatial analysis showing that there is technically sufficient rural land (4.29 Mha) and households (491k) to maximize the potential of all policy objectives simultaneously, but this would require that the program operate in only 83 municipalities across 10 states. Our results highlight the challenges in reaching high poverty regions while meeting multiple other objectives when scaling up forest landscape restoration."

Hurricanes incur substantial damage and economic losses because structures located near the coast tend to be high value as well as particularly exposed. To bolster disaster mitigation and community resilience, it is crucial to understand how hurricane hazards drive social and economic impacts. We integrate detailed hazard simulations, property data, and labor compensation estimates to comprehensively analyze hurricanes’ economic impacts. This study investigates the spatial distribution of probabilistic hurricane hazards, and concomitant property losses and labor impacts, pinpointing particularly hard hit areas. Relationships between capital and labor losses, social vulnerability, and asset values reveal the latter as the primary determinant of overall economic consequences."

The Yellow River Basin is an important ecological barrier and economic zone in our country. By predicting the distribution of wetland landscape and evaluating its evolutionary characteristics, strategies for wetland conservation and utilization in the Yellow River Basin can be formulated. Future land use simulation model can not only simulate the change of multiple land use types, but also reflect the uncertainty of real land use change. In this study, the model was improved and used to predict future wetland changes in the Yellow River Basin. Using the wetland distribution data in 2000 as the initial data, and the wetland distribution data in 2015 as the validation data, setting the parameters according to the land use data of the Yellow River Basin from 1980 to 2000 and the wetland type transfer matrix, after verifying the applicability of the model, the spatial distribution pattern of wetlands in the Yellow River Basin in 2030 was simulated. This research shows that the cost matrix setting method based on the wetland transfer matrix can effectively avoid the errors caused by subjective judgment assignment. By 2030, the wetland distribution in the Yellow River Basin will remain stable, with marshes, paddy fields, and beaches as the main types, similar to 2015. Of all the regions in the Yellow River Basin, Zhengzhou had the highest rate of wetland loss, down 31.94%. On the contrary, Sanmenxia had the highest growth rate of 24.44%."

Bailey,High-altitude balloon-launched uncrewed aircraft system measurements of atmospheric turbulence and qualitative comparison with infrasound microphone response,"This work summarizes measurements conducted in June 2021 using a small, uncrewed, stratospheric glider that was launched from a weather balloon to altitudes up to 30 km above sea level. The aircraft conducted measurements of wind speed and direction, pressure, temperature, and humidity during its descent as well as measurements of infrasonic sound levels. These data were used to evaluate the atmospheric turbulence observed during the descent phase of the flight. 
 This study investigates the use of a balloon-launched uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) for the measurement of turbulence in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. The UAS was a glider which could conduct an automated descent following a designated flight trajectory and was equipped with in situ sensors for measuring thermodynamic and kinematic atmospheric properties. In addition, this aircraft was equipped with an infrasonic microphone to assess its suitability for the remote detection of clear-air turbulence. The capabilities of the UAS and sensing systems were tested during three flights conducted in New Mexico, USA, in 2021. It was found that the profiles of temperature, humidity, and horizontal winds measured during descent were in broad agreement with those made by radiosonde data published by the US National Weather Service, separated by up to 380 km spatially and by 3 to 5 h temporally. Winds measured during controlled flight descent were consistent with the winds measured by global-positioning-system-derived velocity during balloon ascent. During controlled descent with this particular payload, a nominal vertical resolution on the order of 1 m was achieved for temperature, relative humidity, and pressure with a nominal vertical resolution of the wind velocity vector on the order of 0.1 m; the aircraft had a glide slope angle from 1 to 4° during this time. Analysis approaches were developed that provided turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate, but it was found that the corresponding Richardson number was sensitive to the methodology used to determine the vertical gradients from a single flight. The low-frequency content of the infrasonic microphone signal was observed to qualitatively align with long-wavelength wind velocity fluctuations detected at high altitude. Moreover, the microphone measured more broadband frequency content when the aircraft approached turbulence produced by the boundary layer."

This version predicts over 20 soil properties at six depths, providing accurate soil variation maps across China. It outperforms previous versions and global products, offering valuable data for hydrological, ecological analyses, and earth system modeling, enhancing understanding of soil roles in environmental processes. 
 Accurate and high-resolution spatial soil information is crucial for efficient and sustainable land use, management, and conservation. Since the establishment of digital soil mapping (DSM) and the GlobalSoilMap working group, significant advances have been made in spatial soil information globally. However, accurately predicting soil variation over large and complex areas with limited samples remains a challenge, especially for China, which has diverse soil landscapes. To address this challenge, we utilized 11,209 representative multi-source legacy soil profiles (including the Second National Soil Survey of China, World Soil Information Service, First National Soil Survey of China, and regional databases) and high-resolution soil-forming environment characterization. Using advanced Quantile Regression Forest algorithms and a high-performance parallel computing strategy, we developed comprehensive maps of 23 soil physical, chemical and fertility properties at six standard depth layers from 0 to 2 meters in China with a 90 m spatial resolution (China dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling version 2, CSDLv2). Data-splitting and independent samples validation strategies were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted maps quality. The results showed that the predicted maps were significantly more accurate and detailed compared to traditional soil type linkage methods (i.e., CSDLv1, the first version of the dataset), SoilGrids 2.0, and HWSD 2.0 products, effectively representing the spatial variation of soil properties across China. The prediction accuracy of most soil properties at the 0–5 cm depth interval ranged from good to moderate, with Model Efficiency Coefficients for most soil properties ranging from 0.75 to 0.32 during data-splitting validation and from 0.88 to 0.25 during independent sample validation. The wide range between the 5 % lower and 95 % upper prediction limits may indicate substantial room for improvement in current predictions. The relative importance of environmental covariates in predictions varied with soil properties and depth, indicating the complexity of interactions among multiple factors in the soil formation processes. As the soil profiles used in this study mainly originate from the Second National Soil Survey of China during 1970s and 1980s, they could provide new perspectives of soil changes together with existing maps based on 2010s soil profiles.

 Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the most active carbon pool in soils, which plays critical roles in soil carbon cycling, plant productivity, and global climate change. An accurate assessment of the quantity of DOC in the soil is essential for the detailed elucidation of ecosystem functions and services. Nevertheless, the global driving factors and distribution of soil DOC remain inadequately quantified due to the scarcity of large-scale data. Here, a comprehensive global database of 12807 soil DOC concentrations derived from 975 target papers in the literature was compiled. Detailed geographic locations, climate, and soil properties were also recorded as predictors of soil DOC. Machine learning techniques were employed to assess the relative importance of various predictors in the determination of soil DOC concentrations, which were subsequently extended for their prediction on a global scale. The worldwide soil DOC concentration spanned a wide range (0.04 to 7859 mg kg-1), averaging 222.78 mg kg-1. The 12 selected variables (including soil properties, month, climate, and ecosystem) explained 65 % of the variance in soil DOC concentrations. Elevation, soil clay, and soil organic carbon were three of the most important predictors. Global soil DOC concentration increased from the equator to the poles. The soil DOC stocks in the topsoil layer (0–30 cm) amounted to 12.17 Pg, with significant variations observed across different continents. These results are instrumental for informing strategies on soil management practices, ecosystem services, and the mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, our database can be combined with other carbon pools to explore the total soil carbon turnover and constrain Earth carbon models.

It involves a stepwise approach to estimate the basin-level floodplain hydraulic geometry parameters that best respect the scaling law while approximating the global hydrodynamic flood maps. A ~90 m resolution global floodplain map, the Spatial Heterogeneity Improved Floodplain by Terrain analysis (SHIFT), is delineated with demonstrated superiority. 
 Floodplains are a vital part of the global riverine system. Among all the global floodplain delineation strategies empowered by remote sensing, digital elevation model (DEM)-based delineation is considered to be computationally efficient with relatively low uncertainties, but the parsimonious model struggles with incorporating the basin-level spatial heterogeneity of the hydrological and geomorphic influences into the map. In this study, we propose a globally applicable thresholding scheme for DEM-based floodplain delineation to improve the representation of spatial heterogeneity. Specifically, we develop a stepwise approach to estimate the floodplain hydraulic geometry (FHG) scaling parameters for river basins worldwide at the scale of the level-3 HydroBASINS to best respect the scaling law while approximating the spatial extent of two publicly available global flood maps derived from hydrodynamic modeling. The estimated FHG exponent exhibits a significant positive relationship with the basins' hydroclimatic conditions, particularly in 33 of the world's major river basins, indicating the ability of the approach to capture fingerprints from heterogeneous hydrological and geomorphic influences. Based on the spatially varying FHG parameters, a ∼ 90 m resolution global floodplain map named the Spatial Heterogeneity Improved Floodplain by Terrain analysis (SHIFT) is delineated, which takes the hydrologically corrected MERIT Hydro dataset as the DEM inputs and the height above nearest drainage (HAND) as the terrain attribute. Our results demonstrate that SHIFT validates better with reference maps than both hydrodynamic-modeling- and DEM-based approaches with universal parameters. The improved delineation mainly includes better differentiation between main streams and tributaries in major basins and a more comprehensive representation of stream networks in aggregated river basins. SHIFT estimates the global floodplain area to be 9.91×106 km2, representing 6.6 % of the world's total land area.

 Early-life stages play a key role in the dynamics of bipartite life cycle marine fish populations. Difficult to monitor, observations of these stages are often scattered in space and time. While Mediterranean coastlines have often been surveyed, no effort has been made to assemble historical observations. Here we build an exhaustive compilation of dispersal traits for coastal fish species, considering in situ observations and growth models (Di Stefano et al., 2023; https://doi.org/10.17882/91148).Our database contains over 110 000 entries collected from 1993 to 2021 in various subregions. All observations are harmonized to provide information on dates and geolocations of both spawning and settlement, along with pelagic larval durations. When applicable, missing data and associated confidence intervals are reconstructed from dynamic energy budget theory.Statistical analyses allow traits’ variability to be revisited and sampling biases to be revealed across taxa, space and time, hence providing recommendations for future studies and sampling. Comparison of observed and modelled entries provides suggestions to improve the feed of observations into models. Overall, this extensive database is a crucial step to investigate how marine fish populations respond to global changes across environmental gradients."

Moreover, EARice10 is the most up-to-date rice distribution map that comprehensively covers four rice production countries of EA in 10 m resolution. 
 Timely and accurate high-resolution annual mapping of rice distribution is essential for food security, greenhouse gas emissions assessment and supporting for sustainable development goals. East Asia (EA), a major global rice-producing region, accounts for approximately 29.3 % of the world's rice production. Therefore, to acquire the latest rice distribution of the EA, this study proposed a novel rice distribution mapping method based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, producing a 10-meter-resolution annual rice distribution map (EARice10) of EA for 2023. A new Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based Rice distribution Mapping Index (SRMI) was firstly proposed and combined with optical indices to generate representative rice samples. In addition, a stacking-based optical-SAR adaptive fusion model was designed to fully integrate the features of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for high-precision rice mapping in EA. The accuracy of EARice10 was evaluated using more than 90,000 validation samples and achieved an overall accuracy of 90.48 %, with both user’s and producer’s accuracies exceeding 90 %.

High spatial resolution and long-term SS records are the basis for assessing such events. However, tide gauges can provide limited SS information due to sparse and uneven distributions.

 Storm surges (SSs) cause massive loss of life and property in coastal areas each year. High spatial resolution and long-term SS records are the basis for deepening our understanding of this disaster. However, such global or quasi-global scale information could only be simulated by global numerical models until now due to the sparse and uneven distribution of tide gauge stations. In this paper, the all-site modeling framework for the data-driven model was implemented on a quasi-global scale within areas severely affected by SSs caused by tropical and extratropical cyclones. Compared to single-site modeling data-driven models, it can provide SS information for ungauged points. Compared to numerical models, it can reconstruct long-term SSs faster with fewer computational resources. We generated the first high spatial resolution (every 10 km per station along the coastline) hourly SS dataset ASM-SS (all-site modeling storm surge) within 45° S to 45° N, whose record length is over 80 years from 1940 to 2020. Assessments indicate that for 95th extreme SSs, the precision of this model (medians of correlation coefficients, root mean square errors, and mean biases are 0.66, 9 cm, and -4.4 cm, respectively) is slightly better than that of the state-of-the-art global hydrodynamic model (medians are 0.58, 10.8 cm, and -4.3 cm); for annual maximum SSs, our model is more stable than the numerical model with overall root mean square error and coefficient of determination optimizing by around 23.1 % and 14.8 %, respectively. This dataset could provide possible alternative support for coastal communities to estimate return levels of extremes, analyze variations (intensity, frequency, and trend) of SSs, and other relevant applications.

 Seafloor topography, as a fundamental marine spatial geographic information, plays a vital role in marine observation and science research.

The dataset has been publicly available at Zenodo to support further analyses and modelling of peatlands across the globe. This work employed the random forest machine learning model to provide spatially explicit peat carbon stock at pixel basis. 
 Peatlands, which only cover 3 to 5 percent of the global land area, can store up to twice the amount of carbon as the world’s forests. Although recognised for their significant role in the global carbon cycle, discovering the global extent of peatlands and their carbon stock remains challenging. Referring to the UNEP's global peatland map, here we present PEATGRIDS, a data product containing global maps of peat thickness and carbon stock created created using the digital soil mapping approach. We compiled over 25,000 observations of peatland thickness, bulk density (BD) and carbon content (CC), globally. Using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, we estimated peat thickness and peat BD and CC at ~1 km resolution at multiple depths (0–2 m) globally. The estimates were generated using 19 land surface covariates from digital maps and remote sensing images of land use, soil characteristics, topographical features, and climate parameters. The RF models for peat thickness were trained on 25,200 points grouped into six geographic regions. Validation of the peat thickness estimates showed a good performance, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.15 to 0.72. The prediction for peat BD and CC followed the same model architecture and were trained on 17,000 and 7,000 points, respectively. Overall, BD and CC models performed well and consistently across soil layers with average R2 values of 0.61 for BD and 0.48 for CC. Based on the estimated peat thickness, BD and CC, the carbon stock of global peatland was estimated to be 1,029 Pg C for peat dominated area of 6.57 million km2.

 The number of studies investigating the effects of ocean acidification on marine organisms and communities increases every year. Results are not easily comparable since the carbonate chemistry and ancillary data are not always reported in similar units and scales and are not calculated using similar sets of constants.

Mollusca and Cnidaria are still the best-represented taxonomic groups. The biological processes most reported in the datasets are growth and morphology. Other variables that can potentially be affected by ocean acidification and are often reported include calcification/dissolution, primary production/photosynthesis, and biomass/abundance. The majority of the compiled datasets have considered ocean acidification as a single stressor, but their relative contribution has decreased from 68 % before 2015 to 57 % today, showing a clear tendency towards more data archived from multifactorial studies."

In this article, the first detailed stable isotope data of 359 ground ice samples are presented. This first data set provides a new basis for understanding the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation on the QTP. 
 Considered the Asian water tower, the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) processes substantial permafrost, and its hydrological environments are spatially different and can be easily disturbed by changing permafrost and melting ground ice. Permafrost degradation compels melting permafrost to become an important source of surface runoff, changes the storage of groundwater, and greatly influences the hydrological processes in permafrost regions. However, the evidence linking permafrost degradation and hydrological processes on the QTP is lacking, which increases the uncertainties in the evaluation of the results of changing permafrost on the water resources. Stable isotopes offer valuable information on the connections between changing permafrost (ground ice) and water components. It is therefore particularly important to observe the changes in the stable isotopes of different waterbodies which can vary over hourly to annual timescales and truly capture the thawing signals and reflect the influence of permafrost (ground ice) on the regional hydrological processes. The Beiluhe Basin (BLH) in the hinterland of the QTP was selected; it integrates all the water components related to hydrological cycles well and is an ideal site to study the hydrological effect of permafrost change. This paper presents the temporal data of stable isotopes (δ18O, δD, and d-excess) in different waterbodies (precipitation, stream water, thermokarst lake, and groundwater) in the BLH produced between 2017 and 2022. Here, the first detailed stable isotope data of ground ice at 17 boreholes and 2 thaw slumps are presented. A detailed description of the sampling processes, sample pretreating processes, and isotopic data quality control is given. The data first described the full seasonal isotope amplitude in the precipitation, stream, and thermokarst lakes and delineated the depth isotopic variability in ground ice. In total, 554 precipitation samples, 2402 lake/pond samples, 675 stream water samples, 102 supra-permafrost water samples, and 19 sub-permafrost water samples were collected during 6 years of continuous sampling work. Importantly, 359 ground ice samples at different depths from 17 boreholes and 2 profiles were collected. This first dataset provides a new basis for understanding the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation on the QTP. It also provides support for the cryospheric study on the Northern Hemisphere.

To accurately asses these impacts, we developed a machine learning model to downscale daily climate data to hourly Temperature Humidity Index (THI) values. We utilised historical weather data to train our model and applied it to future climate projections, under two climate scenarios. 
 Climate change poses a significant threat to agriculture, with potential impacts on food security, economic stability, and human livelihoods. Dairy cattle, a crucial component of the livestock sector, are particularly vulnerable to heat stress, which can adversely affect milk production, immune function, feed intake, and in extreme cases, lead to mortality. The Temperature Humidity Index (THI) is a widely used metric to quantify the combined effects of temperature and humidity on cattle. However, most studies estimate THI using daily-level data, which fails to capture the full extent of daily thermal load and cumulative heat stress, especially during nights when cooling is inadequate. To address this limitation, we developed a machine learning approach to temporally downscale daily climate data to hourly THI values. Utilizing historical ERA5 reanalysis data, we trained an XGBoost model and generated hourly THI datasets for 12 NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 climate models under two emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) extending to the end of the century. This high-resolution THI data provides a more accurate assessment of heat stress in dairy cattle, enabling better predictions and management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on this vital agricultural sector."

Our study created a comprehensive Alaska inventory combining various data sources with which we improved infrastructure classification and data on contaminated sites. This resource is presented as a GeoPackage allowing planning of infrastructure damage and possible implications for Arctic communities facing permafrost challenges. 
 The Arctic region has undergone warming at a rate more than 3 times higher than the global average. This warming has led to the degradation of near-surface permafrost, resulting in decreased ground stability. This instability not only poses a primary hazard to Arctic infrastructure and human-impacted areas but can also lead to secondary ecological hazards from infrastructure failure associated with hazardous materials. This development underscores the need for a comprehensive inventory of critical infrastructure and human-impacted areas. The inventory should be linked to environmental data to assess their susceptibility to permafrost degradation as well as the ecological consequences that may arise from infrastructure failure. Here, we provide such an inventory for Alaska, a vast state covering approximately 1.7 × 106 km2, with a population of over 733 000 people and a history of industrial development on permafrost. Our Synthesized Inventory of CRitical Infrastructure and HUman-Impacted Areas in AlaSka (SIRIUS) integrates data from (i) the Sentinel-1/2-derived Arctic Coastal Human Impact dataset (SACHI); (ii) OpenStreetMap (OSM); (iii) the pan-Arctic Catchment Database (ARCADE); (iv) a dataset of permafrost extent, probability and mean annual ground temperatures; and (v) the Contaminated Sites Database and reports to create a unified new dataset of critical infrastructure and human-impacted areas as well as permafrost and watershed information for Alaska. The integration process included harmonizing spatial references, extents and geometries across all the datasets as well as incorporating a uniform usage type classification scheme for the infrastructure data. Additionally, we employed text-mining techniques to generate complementary geospatial data from textual reports on contaminated sites, including details on contaminants, cleanup duration and the affected media. The combination of SACHI and OSM enhanced the detail of the usage type classification for infrastructure from 5 to 13 categories, allowing the identification of elements critical to Arctic communities beyond industrial sites. Further, the new inventory integrates the high spatial detail of OSM with the unbiased infrastructure detection capability of SACHI, accurately representing 94 % of the  polygonal infrastructure and 78 % of the linear infrastructure, respectively.

The method locally adjusts resolution in regions which are most relevant to modelling, based on the properties of the plasma. The runs testing this method show that adaptive refinement manages to highlight the desired regions with manageable performance overhead. Performance in larger-scale production runs and mitigation of overhead are avenues of further research. 
 Automatically adaptive grid resolution is a common way of improving simulation accuracy while keeping computational efficiency at a manageable level. In space physics, adaptive grid strategies are especially useful as simulation volumes are extreme, while the most accurate physical description is based on electron dynamics and hence requires very small grid cells and time steps. Therefore, many past global simulations encompassing, for example, near-Earth space have made tradeoffs in terms of the physical description and laws of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) used that require less accurate grid resolutions. Recently, using supercomputers, it has become possible to model the near-Earth space domain with an ion-kinetic hybrid scheme going beyond MHD-based fluid dynamics. These simulations, however, must develop a new adaptive mesh strategy beyond what is used in MHD simulations.We developed an automatically adaptive grid refinement strategy for ion-kinetic hybrid-Vlasov schemes, and we implemented it within the Vlasiator global solar wind–magnetosphere–ionosphere simulation. This method automatically adapts the resolution of the Vlasiator grid using two indices: one formed as a maximum of dimensionless gradients measuring the rate of spatial change in selected variables and the other derived from the ratio of the current density to the magnetic field density perpendicular to the current. Both these indices can be tuned independently to reach a desired level of refinement and computational load. We test the indices independently and compare the results to a control run using static refinement.The results show that adaptive refinement highlights relevant regions of the simulation domain and keeps the computational effort at a manageable level. We find that the refinement shows some overhead in the rate of cells solved per second. This overhead can be large compared to the control run without adaptive refinement, possibly due to resource utilization, grid complexity, and issues in load balancing. These issues lay out a development roadmap for future optimizations."

The current study explored the potential of deploying a coupled modelling framework for the estimation and forecasting of this parameter. The framework showed promising potential in addressing the challenge of estimating and forecasting the under-ice discharge. 
 Year-round river discharge estimation and forecasting is a critical component of sustainable water resource management. However, in cold climate regions such as Canada, this basic task gets intricated due to the challenge of river ice conditions. River ice conditions are dynamic and can change quickly in a short period of time. This dynamic nature makes river ice conditions difficult to forecast. Moreover, the observation of under-ice river discharge also remains a challenge since no reliable method for its estimation has been developed till date. It is therefore an active field of research and development. The integration of river ice hydraulic models in forecasting systems has remained relatively uncommon. The current study has two main objectives: first is to demonstrate the development and capabilities of a river ice forecasting system based on coupled hydrological and hydraulic modelling approach for the Chaudière River in Québec; and second is to assess its functionality over selected winter events. The forecasting system is developed within a well-known operational forecasting platform: the Delft Flood Early Warning System (Delft-FEWS). The current configuration of the systems integrates (i) meteorological products such as the Regional Ensemble Prediction System (REPS); (ii) a hydrological module implemented through the HydrOlOgical Prediction LAboratory (HOOPLA), a multi-model based hydrological modelling framework; and (iii) hydraulic module implemented through a 1D steady and unsteady HEC-RAS river ice models. The system produces ensemble forecasts for discharge and water level and provides flexibility to modify various dynamic parameters within the modelling chain such as discharge timeseries, ice thickness, ice roughness as well as carryout hindcasting experiments in a batch production way. Performance of the coupled modelling approach was assessed using “Perfect forecast” over winter events between 2020 and 2023 winter seasons. The root mean square error (RMSE) and percent bias (Pbias) metrics were calculated. The hydrologic module of the system showed significant deviations from the observations. These deviations could be explained by the inherent uncertainty in the under-ice discharge estimates as well as uncertainty in the modelling chain. The hydraulic module of the system performed better and the Pbias was within ±10 %."

The coded equation terms in the governing equations that are sensitive (or insensitive) to the precision level have been identified. The performance of mixed-precision computing in weather and climate simulations was analyzed. 
 Atmosphere modelling applications are becoming increasingly memory-bound due to the inconsistent development rates between processor speeds and memory bandwidth. In this study, we mitigate memory bottlenecks and reduce the computational load of the Global–Regional Integrated Forecast System (GRIST) dynamical core by adopting a mixed-precision computing strategy. Guided by an application of the iterative development principle, we identify the coded equation terms that are precision insensitive and modify them from double to single precision. The results show that most precision-sensitive terms are predominantly linked to pressure gradient and gravity terms, while most precision-insensitive terms are advective terms. Without using more computing resources, computational time can be saved, and the physical performance of the model is largely kept. In the standard computational test, the reference runtime of the model's dry hydrostatic core, dry nonhydrostatic core, and the tracer transport module is reduced by 24 %, 27 %, and 44 %, respectively. A series of idealized tests, real-world weather and climate modelling tests, was performed to assess the optimized model performance qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, in the long-term coarse-resolution climate simulation, the precision-induced sensitivity can manifest at the large scale, while in the kilometre-scale weather forecast simulation, the model's sensitivity to the precision level is mainly limited to small-scale features, and the wall-clock time is reduced by 25.5 % from the double- to mixed-precision full-model simulations."

It leverages acoustic signals generated by tsunamis, which propagate faster than the tsunami itself, enabling real-time detection and assessment. Integrating various models, the software provides reliable and rapid assessment, mapping risk areas, and estimating tsunami amplitude. This advancement reduces false alarms and enhances global tsunami warning systems' accuracy and efficiency. 
 We introduce a tsunami warning technology towards a global real-time analysis. The technology is based on the analysis of acoustic signals generated together with the tsunami, due to the compression of the water layer. The acoustic signals propagate much faster than the tsunami, and thus can be recorded at hydrophone stations, which in turn enables the analysis in real-time. The presented technology comprises a collection of models that have been integrated into a software with the goal to make it operational, to complement efforts by warning centres and provide a more reliable assessment, globally. The main models that were integrated in the software are presented and briefly discussed. Test cases performed by the software are compared with DART buoy observations, showing satisfactory agreement though discrepancies arise in particular at far distances and locations separated by land. The calculation time of a full global-scale analysis is in the order of tens of seconds on a standard multi-core machine, without reliance on pre-computations, making it appropriate real-time forecast."

This upgrade enables it to resolve realistic urban geometries more accurately and to take advantage of the resources available on current and future high-performance computing systems. 
 uDALES is an open-source multi-physics microscale urban modelling tool, capable of performing large-eddy simulation (LES) of urban airflow, heat transfer, and pollutant dispersion. We present uDALES v2.0, which has two main new features: (1) an improved parallelisation that prepares the codebase for conducting exascale simulations and (2) a conservative immersed boundary method (IBM) suitable for an urban surface that does not need to be aligned with the underlying Cartesian grid. The urban geometry and local topography are incorporated via a triangulated surface with a resolution that is independent of the fluid grid. The IBM developed here includes the use of wall functions to apply surface fluxes, and the exchange of heat and moisture between the surface and the air is conservative by construction. We perform a number of validation simulations, ranging from neutral, coupled internal–external flows and non-neutral cases. We observe close agreement with the relevant literature, both in cases in which the buildings are aligned with the Cartesian grid and when they are at an angle. We introduce a validation case specifically for urban applications, for which we show that supporting non-grid-aligned geometries is crucial when solving surface energy balances, with errors of up to 20 % associated with using a grid-aligned geometry."

Compared to other S2S models, the IAP-CAS model has its benefits but also biases, i.e., underdispersive ensemble, overestimated amplitude, and faster propagation speed when forecasting MJO. We provide a reason for these biases and prospects for further improvement of this system in the future. 
 The Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a crucial predictability source on a subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescale. Therefore, the models participating in the World Weather Research Programme and the World Climate Research Programme (WWRP/WCRP) S2S prediction project focus on accurately predicting and analyzing the MJO. This study provides a detailed description of the configuration within the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAP-CAS) S2S forecast system. We assess the accuracy of the IAP-CAS model's MJO forecast using traditional Real-time Multivariate MJO (RMM) analysis and cluster analysis. Then, we explain the reasons behind any bias observed in the MJO forecast. Comparing the 20-year hindcast with observations, we found that the IAP-CAS ensemble mean has a skill of 24 d. However, the ensemble spread still has potential for improvement. To examine the MJO structure in detail, we use cluster analysis to classify the MJO events during boreal winter into four types: fast-propagating, slow-propagating, standing, and jumping patterns of MJO. The model exhibits biases of overestimated amplitude and faster propagation speed in the propagating MJO events. Upon further analysis, it was found that the model forecasted a wetter background state. This leads to stronger forecasted convection and coupled waves, especially in the fast MJO events. The overestimation of the strength and length of MJO-coupled waves results in a faster MJO mode and quicker dissipation in the IAP-CAS model. These findings show that the IAP-CAS skillfully forecasts signals of MJO and its propagation, and they also provide valuable guidance for improving the current MJO forecast by developing the ensemble system and moisture forecast."

Our results demonstrate that the streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) method outperforms the other approaches. We found that excessively frequent reinitialization can lead to exceptionally high errors in simulations. 
 Numerical modeling of ice sheet dynamics is a critical tool for projecting future sea level rise. Among all the processes responsible for the loss of mass of the ice sheets, enhanced ice discharge triggered by the retreat of marine-terminating glaciers is one of the key drivers. Numerical models of ice sheet flow are therefore required to include ice front migration in order to reproduce today's mass loss and to be able to predict their future. However, the discontinuous nature of calving poses a significant numerical challenge for accurately capturing the motion of the ice front. In this study, we explore different stabilization techniques combined with varying reinitialization strategies to enhance the numerical stability and accuracy of solving the level-set function, which tracks the position of the ice front. Through rigorous testing on an idealized domain with a semicircular and a straight-line ice front, including scenarios with diverse front velocities, we assess the performance of these techniques. The findings contribute to advancing our ability to model ice sheet dynamics, specifically calving processes, and provide valuable insights into the most effective strategies for simulating and tracking the motion of the ice front."

Wing;Levi G. Silvers;Kevin A. Reed,RCEMIP-II: mock-Walker simulations as phase II of the radiative–convective equilibrium model intercomparison project,"This paper presents the experimental design for a model intercomparison project to study tropical clouds and climate. It is a follow-up from a prior project that used a simplified framework for tropical climate. The new project adds one new component – a specified pattern of sea surface temperatures as the lower boundary condition. We provide example results from one cloud-resolving model and one global climate model and test the sensitivity to the experimental parameters. 
 The radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE) model intercomparison project (RCEMIP) leveraged the simplicity of RCE to focus attention on moist convective processes and their interactions with radiation and circulation across a wide range of model types including cloud-resolving models (CRMs), general circulation models (GCMs), single-column models, global cloud-resolving models, and large-eddy simulations. While several robust results emerged across the spectrum of models that participated in the first phase of RCEMIP (RCEMIP-I), two points that stand out are (1) the strikingly large diversity in simulated climate states and (2) the strong imprint of convective self-aggregation on the climate state. However, the lack of consensus in the structure of self-aggregation and its response to warming is a barrier to understanding. Gaining a deeper understanding of convective aggregation and tropical climate will require reducing the degrees of freedom with which convection can vary. Therefore, we propose phase II of RCEMIP (RCEMIP-II) that utilizes a prescribed sinusoidal sea surface temperature (SST) pattern to provide a constraint on the structure of convection and move one critical step up the model hierarchy. This so-called “mock-Walker” configuration generates features that resemble observed tropical circulations. The specification of the mock-Walker protocol for RCEMIP-II is described, along with example results from one CRM and one GCM. RCEMIP-II will consist of five required simulations: three simulations with the same three mean SSTs as in RCEMIP-I but with an SST gradient and two additional simulations at one of the mean SSTs with different values of the SST gradients. We also test the sensitivity to the imposed SST gradient and the domain size. Under weak SST gradients, unforced self-aggregation emerges across the entire domain, similar to what was found in RCEMIP. As the SST gradient increases, the convective region narrows and is more confined to the warmest SSTs. At warmer mean SSTs and stronger SST gradients, low-frequency variability in the convective aggregation emerges, suggesting that simulations of at least 200 d may be needed to achieve robust equilibrium statistics in this configuration. Simulations with different domain sizes generally have similar mean statistics and convective structures, depending on the value of the SST gradient. The prescribed SST boundary condition is the only difference in the set-up between RCEMIP-II and RCEMIP-I, which enables comparison between the two; however, we also welcome participation in RCEMIP-II from models that did not participate in RCEMIP-I."

Other components of this ecosystem include dissolved inorganic nitrogen, twenty size classes of zooplankton, and detritus, all modelled as Eulerian fields.

Herein, we outline the changes to the mean climate state of E3SM that were introduced by the addition of this parameterization. Overall, the presence of the submesoscale parameterization improves the fidelity of the v2.1 simulation by reducing the North Atlantic ocean surface biases present in v2, as illustrated by changes to the climatological sea surface temperature and salinity, as well as Arctic sea-ice extent. Other impacts include a slight shoaling of the mixed layer depths in the North Atlantic, as well as a small improvement to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We note that the expected shoaling due to the parameterization is regionally dependent in our coupled configuration. In addition, we investigate why the parameterization and its impacts on mixed layer depth have little impact on the simulated AMOC: despite increased dense water formation in the Norwegian Sea, only a small fraction of the water formed makes its way south into the North Atlantic basin.

FINAM supports bidirectional coupling of spatial models, enabling fast in-memory data exchange, and provides a consistent interface for flexible coupling. The main assumption for a successful coupling is that every model operates with a time loop at its core. This design of FINAM allows for straightforward model extensions written in Python without altering the original model source code. Python's robust interoperability features further enhance FINAM's capabilities, allowing interfaces with various programming languages including Fortran, C, C++, Rust, and others. This paper describes the main principles and modules of FINAM and presents example workflows to demonstrate its features. These examples range from simple toy models to well-established models like OpenGeoSys and Bodium covering features like bidirectional dependencies, complex model coupling, and spatio-temporal regridding."

Wilson,Interaction of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances with Estrogen Receptors in Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): An In Silico Investigation,"Fresh water sources, including lakes, such as the Great Lakes, are some of the most important ecosystems in the world. Despite the importance of these lakes, there is increasing concern about the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)─among the most prevalent contaminants of our time─due to the ability of PFAS to bioaccumulate and persist in the environment, as well as to its linkages to detrimental human and animal health effects. In this study, PFAS exposure on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is examined at the molecular level, focusing on the impact of PFAS binding on the alpha (α) and beta (β) estrogen receptors (ERs) using molecular dynamics simulations, binding free energy calculations, and structural analysis. ERs are involved in fundamental physiological processes, including reproductive system development, muscle regeneration, and immunity. This study shows that PFAS binds to both the estrogen α and estrogen β receptors, albeit via different binding modes, due to a modification of an amino acid in the binding site as a result of a reorientation of residues in the binding pocket. As ER overactivation can occur through environmental toxins and pollutants, this study provides insights into the influence of different types of PFAS on protein function."

As a novel alternative to BPA, 4-hydroxy-4′-isopropoxydiphenylsulfone (BPSIP) is frequently detected in breast milk and placental barrier systems, suggesting potential transmission from the mother to offspring and increased risk of exposure. Gestation and lactation are critical periods for central nervous system development, which are vulnerable to certain environmental pollutants. Herein, we investigated the behavioral impacts and neurobiological effects of early-life exposure to BPSIP (0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/kg body weight/day) in mice offspring. Behavioral studies indicated that BPSIP exposure induced ASD-like behaviors, including elevated anxiety-related behavior and decreased spatial memory, in both male and female pups. A distinct pattern of reduced social novelty was observed only in female offspring, accompanied by significant alterations in antioxidant levels. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched in pathways related to behaviors and neurodevelopment, which were consistent with the observed phenotype. Besides, a decrease in the protein levels of complex IV (COX IV) across all tested populations suggests a profound impact on mitochondrial function, potentially leading to abnormal energy metabolism in individuals with autism. Additionally, changes in synaptic proteins, evidenced by alterations in synapsin 1 (SYN1) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) levels in the cerebellum and hippocampus, support the notion of synaptic involvement. These findings suggest that BPSIP may induce sex-specific neurotoxic effects that involve oxidative stress, energy generation, and synaptic plasticity."

This study presents a systematic and intuitive picture of Cu toxicity induced by exogenous acidification in phytoplankton Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We first showed that acidification reduced the algal resistance to environmental Cu stress with a decreased growth rate and increased Cu bioaccumulation. To further investigate this phenomenon, we employed specific fluorescent probes to visualize the intracellular labile Cu pools in different algal cells. Our findings indicated that acidification disrupted the intracellular labile Cu trafficking, leading to a significant increase in labile Cu(I) pools. At the molecular level, Cu toxicity resulted in the inhibition of the Cu(I) import system and activation of the Cu(I) export system in acidic algal cells, likely a response to the imbalance in intracellular labile Cu trafficking. Subcellular analysis revealed that Cu toxicity induced extensive mitochondrial dysfunction and impacted the biogenesis and assembly of the respiratory chain complex in acidic algal cells. Concurrently, we proposed that the activation of polyP synthesis could potentially regulate disrupted intracellular labile Cu trafficking. Our study offers an intuitive, multilevel perspective on the origins and impacts of Cu toxicity in living organisms, providing valuable insights on metal toxicity."

The staining conditions were optimized to 30 min staining with 2 μM JC-1 for best J-aggregate formation.

Case Studies of Chromium and Zinc,"Metal(loid)s in sewage sludge (SS) are effectively immobilized after pyrolysis. However, the bioavailability and fate of the immobilized metal(loid)s in SS-derived biochar (SSB) following land application remain largely unknown. Here, the speciation and bioavailability evolution of SSB-borne Cr and Zn in soil were systematically investigated by combining pot and field trials and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Results showed that approximately 58% of Cr existing as Cr(III)-humic complex in SS were transformed into Fe (hydr)oxide-bound Cr(III), while nano-ZnS in SS was transformed into stable ZnS and ferrihydrite-bound species (accounting for over 90% of Zn in SSB) during pyrolysis. All immobilized metal(loid)s, including Cr and Zn, in SSB tended to be slowly remobilized during aging in soil. This study highlighted that SSB acted as a dual role of source and sink of metal(loid)s in soil and posed potential risks by serving a greater role of a metal(loid) source than a sink when applied to uncontaminated soils. Nevertheless, SSB could impede the translocation of metal(loid)s from soil to crop compared to SS, where coexisting elements, including Fe, P, and Zn, played critical roles. These findings provide new insights for understanding the fate of SSB-borne metal(loid)s in soil and assessing the viability of pyrolyzing SS for land application."

The typical degradation route on titanium-based catalysts, “toluene–benzaldehyde–carbon dioxide”, necessitates the oxidation of the methyl group as a prerequisite for photocatalytic toluene oxidation. However, the inherent planar adsorption configuration of toluene molecules, dominated by the benzene rings, leads to significant steric hindrance for the methyl group. This steric hindrance prevents the methyl group from contacting the active species on the catalyst surface, thereby limiting the removal of toluene under indoor conditions. To date, no effective strategy to control the steric hindrance of the methyl group has been identified. Herein, we showed a B–Ti–O interface that exhibits significantly enhanced toluene removal efficiency under indoor conditions. In-depth investigations revealed that, compared to typical Ti-based photocatalysts, the steric hindrance between the methyl group and the catalyst surface decreased from 3.42 to 3.03 Å on the designed interface. This reduction originates from the matching of orbital energy levels between Ti 3dz2 and C 2pz of the benzene ring. The decreased steric hindrance improved the efficiency of toluene being attacked by surface active species, allowing for rapid conversion into benzaldehyde and benzoic acid species for subsequent reactions. Our work provides novel insights into the steric hindrance effect in the elimination of aromatic volatile organic compounds."

Results revealed that, in the presence of 2.0 mM S(IV), both As(V) and As(III) were selectively converted into scorodite at pH0 3.0–7.0, while As(III) oxidation and As(V) immobilization were impressed over pH0 8.0–10.0. Batch experiments, radical quenching experiments, and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements demonstrated that ZVI initially boosted S(IV) activation to generate SO4•–, •OH, and protons, and in turn, ZVI was further oxidized more intensely by these radicals than by oxygen. Concurrently, substantial protons derived from S(IV) oxidation neutralized hydroxyls produced by ZVI oxidation, maintaining an acidic environment conducive to the generation of scorodite rather than iron (hydr)oxides. Characterizations of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed that scorodite was formed in situ and then exfoliated from the surface of ZVI, and approximately 75% of ZVI could still be recovered, which contributed to efficient As removal in successive runs and real As-polluted wastewater. The application of S(IV) achieved a balance among ZVI reactivity improvement, As(V)/As(III) removal, and raw material consumption, making it a promising approach for addressing arsenic contamination in wastewater treatment."

Herein, we designed a nanoconfined FeCo2O4-embedded ceramic membrane (FeCo2O4−CM) under flow-through pattern for PMS activation. Confining PMS and FeCo2O4 within nanochannels (3.0−4.7 nm) enhanced adsorption interactions (−7.84 eV vs −2.20 eV), thus boosting mass transfer.

This principle enables potential ES application for various weak acids and bases (WABs) without reactions themselves. We established an eABTLP method for detecting orthophosphate in solutions as a proof of concept, demonstrating commendable accuracy and precision, and a wide detection range from 10 μM to over 300 mM. Endogenous interferences were identified using 23 weak acids, indicating no significant endogenous interfering factors in typical wastewaters. Of them, volatile fatty acids are the main interference, but their effect can be eliminated by adjusting pH above 6.0. Exogenous factors like anions, cations, ion strength, temperature, organic load, and dissolved oxygen were examined, and most of their effects can be ignored by maintaining consistent analytical procedures between calibration curve and sample. Furthermore, measurement of wastewater samples confirmed the applicability toward domestic wastewater and demonstrated its wide applicability when combined with digestion pretreatment.

Adding HCN to low-absorbance euphotic zone seawater decreased CO photoproduction. Modeling [HCN] (∼5 to 364 μM) vs the percent decrease in CO photoproduction (%CO↓) yielded carbonyl-cyanohydrin dissociation equilibrium constants, KD, and maximum %CO↓, %CO↓max values. Four Atlantic and Pacific seawater KDs (66.7 ± 19.6 μM) overlap aqueous aliphatic but not aromatic aldehyde KDs. Phenylacetaldehyde (PA) and other β,γ-unsaturated aldehydes are proposed as prototypical CO precursors. Direct photolysis of ∼10 nM PA can supply the measured daily production of HCN-sensitive CO at an open-ocean site near Bermuda. HCN’s %CO↓max was 31 ± 2.5% in North Atlantic seawater vs the 13 ± 2.5% inhibition of CO photoproduction by borohydride, a dilemma since only borohydride affects most ketones. Borohydride also decreased CDOM absorption much more than did HCN. This puzzle probably reflects differing steric and solvation requirements in HCN- and borohydride-CDOM reactions.

To date, 53 African countries have submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and four have committed to a net-zero target. However, many of Africa’s NDCs are vaguely expressed and without specific focus on explicit sectoral decarbonization targets. Furthermore, Africa’s huge land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) potential remains unclear in the context of enabling net-zero emissions within the continent. This study achieves two objectives: Under a NZ GHG emission trajectory in Africa, we uncover the implications of a targeted zero-emission electricity sector by 2030, on the energy landscape and other sustainability factors.  This study also features the role of land-based biological removal methods─bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation/reforestation (A/R)─in net zero actualization in Africa. Our results reveal a unified but disparate actualisation of the mid-century net zero emission goal across the continent, as all regions except North Africa achieve carbon neutrality. The industrial sector  faces significant difficulties in transitioning and contributes  substantially to positive emissions on the continent, with its share of total residual emissions reaching 49–64% by 2050. This difficulty persists even with targeted sectoral decarbonization of the electricity sector, although it is significantly reduced by the availability of BECCS as a CDR option. Under thezero-emission electricity pathway, emissions in buildings and transport sectors are reduced due to rapid electrification. A trade-off emerges in the net zero pathway concerning land allocation for negative emissions versus other land use activities. A key result shows that achieving a net zero target in Africa leads to a cumulative loss of $102 billion in fossil fuel infrastructure within the electricity sector by mid-century, which doubles when the zero-emission electricity goal is achieved."

However, our understanding of their foliar uptake, translocation, and trophic transfer profiles is limited due to a lack of quantitative analytical tools to effectively probe mechanisms of action. Here, using synthesized deuterium (2H) stable isotope-labeled polystyrene nanoplastics (2H-PSNPs), the foliar accumulation and translocation of NPs in lettuce and the dynamics of NP transfer along a lettuce–snail terrestrial food chain were investigated. Raman imaging and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that foliar-applied NPs aggregated on the leaf surface, entered the mesophyll tissue via the stomatal pathway, and eventually translocated to root tissues. Quantitative analysis showed that increasing levels of foliar exposure to 2H-PSNPs (0.1, 1, and 5 mg/L in spray solutions, equivalent to receiving 0.15, 1.5, and 7.5 μg/d of NPs per plant) enhanced NP accumulation in leaves, with concentrations ranging from 0.73 to 15.6 μg/g (dw), but only limited translocation (<5%) to roots. After feeding on 5 mg/L 2H-PSNP-contaminated lettuce leaves for 14 days, snails accumulated NPs at 0.33 to 10.7 μg/kg (dw), with an overall kinetic trophic transfer factor of 0.45, demonstrating trophic dilution in this food chain. The reduced ingestion rate of 3.18 mg/g/day in exposed snails compared to 6.43 mg/g/day can be attributed to the accumulation of 2H-PSNPs and elevated levels of chemical defense metabolites in the lettuce leaves, which decreased the palatability for snails and disrupted their digestive function. This study provides critical quantitative information on the characteristics of airborne NP bioaccumulation and the associated risks to terrestrial food chains."

To further investigate the full dynamics of Hg cycling, we modeled Hg inventories and fluxes in the upper ocean under upwelling and non-upwelling scenarios. The model simulations confirmed and quantified that upwelling enhances sinking fluxes of Hg by 41% through elevated primary production.

The loss of redox sites and competitive adsorption of H2O prevalent in the treatment of industrial exhaust gases are the main reasons for the weak mineralization ability and poor water vapor resistance of V-based catalysts. In this work, platinum (Pt) is selected to combine with the V/CeO2 catalyst, which provides more redox sites and H2O dissociative activation sites and further enhances its catalytic performance. The results show that PtV/CeO2 achieves 90% of the CO2 yield at 318 °C and maintains excellent catalytic activity rather than continuous deactivation within 15 h after water vapor injection. The formation of Pt–O–V bonds enhances the redox ability and promotes deep oxidation of polychlorinated intermediates, accounting for the significantly improved mineralization ability of PtV/CeO2. The dissociative activation effect of Pt on H2O molecules strengthens the migration and activation of V-adsorbed H2O, precluding V-poisoning and notably improving water resistance.

However, RO membranes themselves may contain PFAS, which can potentially leach into treated drinking water. Leaching experiments and direct total oxidizable precursor assays revealed the presence and leaching potential of PFOS (branched and linear), PFBA, PFHxA, PFNA, and PFOA in five selected commercial RO membranes. This resulted in the release of tens of milligrams of ΣPFAS per membrane element used in drinking water production. Depending on assumptions made regarding leaching kinetics and volume of produced water per membrane element, predicted concentrations of ΣPFAS in the produced water ranged from less than one up to hundreds of pg/L. These concentrations are two to four orders of magnitude lower than those currently observed in Dutch drinking waters. The origin of PFAS in the membranes remains unclear. Further research is needed to bridge the gap between the laboratory conditions as used in this study and the real-world conditions and for a full understanding of potential leaching scenarios.

In this study, we tackled this challenge through a series of column experiments involving fine (100–300 μm) and coarse (1.0–1.4 mm) sand particles coated with birnessite (MnO2) under variable saturation degrees. Dynamic flow experiments in sand columns revealed that desaturation altered the ability of MnO2 in removing tetracycline (TTC), a redox-active antibiotic, yet the effect depends on the sand type and then on the saturation degree. Moderate saturation degrees in fine-grained sand columns promoted fractional and preferential water flow which favored a more acidic pH and increased dissolved oxygen levels. These conditions enhanced TTC removal, despite the reduced physical accessibility of reactive phases. In contrast, lower saturation degrees in coarse-grained sand columns induced stronger flow heterogeneity with a very small fraction of the water content participating in flow. The mobility behavior of all the columns was predicted using transport models that consider TTC adsorption and transformation, as well as dual porosity under variable water saturation degrees. This research offers valuable insights into predicting the fate and transport of redox-active contaminants in unsaturated soils and subsurface environments."

Postexposure, these mice developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-like symptoms characterized by inflammatory lung damage and functional impairment. In light of the antiestrogenic properties of TBC, we administrated estradiol (E2) to investigate its potential protective role against TBC-induced damage and found that the coexposure of E2 notably mitigated the COPD-like phenotypes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TBC exposure reduced estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression and increased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) expression, while E2 treatment rebalanced the expression levels of ERα and NF-κB to their normative states. Our findings indicate that TBC, as an antiestrogenic agent, may contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD through an ERα-mediated inflammatory pathway, but that E2 treatment could reverse the impairment, providing a potentially promising remedial treatment.

This study not only increases our understanding of contaminant-oriented optimization of AOPs but also successfully bridges the gap between ML model development and its environmental application."

Natural organic amino compounds are known precursors to N-DBPs. Three Suwannee River (SR) standard reference materials (SRMs), humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and natural organic matter (NOM), are commonly used to study DBP formation, but the chemical makeup of amino compounds in SRSRMs remains largely unknown. To address this, we combined stable hydrogen/deuterium isotope labeling, HDPairFinder bioinformatics, and nontargeted high-performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) to characterize these compounds in SRSRMs. This method classifies reactive amines, provides accurate masses and MS/MS spectra, and quantifies intensities. We identified 2707 high-quality features with primary and/or secondary amines in SRSRMs and 75% of them having an m/z < 300. Across all three SRSRMs, 327 amino features were detected, while 856, 794, and 200 unique features were found in SRNOM, SRHA, and SRFA, respectively. In North Saskatchewan River (NSR) samples, a total of 6449 amino features were detected, 818 of them matched those in SRSRMs, and 87% of them were different between the two rivers. Using chemical standards, we confirmed 10 compounds and tentatively identified 5 more. This study highlights similarities and differences in reactive N-precursors in SRSRMs and local river water, enhancing the understanding of geo-differences in reactive N-precursors in different source waters."

Subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) as an emerging green technology has demonstrated remarkable promise in environmental remediation. However, there is limited research on the remediation of highly toxic Cr(VI) using HTL. This study reveals that the HTL reaction of biomass enables the simultaneous reduction and precipitation of Cr(VI). At 280 °C, the reduction of Cr(VI) was nearly complete, with a high reduction rate of 98.9%. The reduced Cr as Cr(OH)3 and Cr2O3 was primarily enriched in hydrochar, accounting for over 99.9% of the total amount. This effective enrichment resulted in the removal of Cr(VI) from the aqueous phase while simultaneously yielding clean liquid compounds like organic acids and furfural. Furthermore, the elevated temperature facilitated the formation of Cr(III) and enhanced its accumulation within hydrochar. Notably, the resulting hydrochar and small oxygenated compounds, especially aldehyde, served as electron donors for Cr(VI) reduction. Additionally, the dissolved Cr facilitated the depolymerization and deoxygenation processes of macromolecular compounds with lignin-like structures, leading to more small oxygenated compounds and subsequently influencing Cr(VI) reduction.

Microplastic concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 0.13 particles m–3 over the course of a year. The proportion of microplastic fragments in winter was significantly higher than that in other seasons, with median microplastic sizes in autumn and winter being larger than those in spring and summer. The atmospheric microplastic surface was rough, exhibiting irregular pores and multiple depressions and cracks. Microplastics experienced vertical mixing with the upper atmosphere in April and August and were influenced by rainfall in July. The residence time of atmospheric particles ranged from 9.47 to 22.85 days throughout the year, with an average of 14.41 days.

However, the transport pathways and storm responses of different nitrogen forms remain elusive. We used high-frequency chemical and isotopic sampling to partition sources of stormwater runoff and determine transport pathways of multiple nitrogen forms in an agricultural catchment. Bayesian mixing modeling reveals shallow subsurface water as the dominant source of stormwater runoff, contributing 74% of the water flux and 72, 71, and 79% of total nitrogen (TN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and nitrate (NO3-N), respectively. Groundwater, by contrast, contributed 11% of stormwater runoff and 21, 22, and 17% of TN, TDN, and NO3-N, respectively. The remaining 14% of stormwater runoff can be attributed to rainwater, which contains much less TN, TDN, and NO3-N. Surprisingly, during storm events, the dominant nitrogen form was NO3-N rather than dissolved organic nitrogen. Antecedent conditions and runoff characteristics have an important influence on nitrogen loads during storm events. Our results provide insight into hydrological mechanisms driving nitrogen transport during storm events and may help in developing catchment management practices for reducing nitrogen pollution in aquatic ecosystems."

Using the established WQC in China and the USA as a case study, we combined mathematical derivation and data validation to evaluate the BER method. Among various species-taxon groups of freshwater organisms, planktonic crustaceans demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy. Our analysis further revealed that species toxicity sensitivity and regional variability jointly influence the prediction accuracy. Regardless of the evaluation indexes, planktonic crustaceans emerged as the most suitable species-taxon group for the BER method.

However, the potential environmental health impacts of BAC on fish remain poorly explored. In this study, we show that BAC and TCS can induce the gut dysbiosis in zebrafish (Danio rerio), with substantial effects on health. Breeding pairs of adult zebrafish were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of BAC and TCS (0.4–40 μg/L) for 42 days. Both BAC and TCS exposure perturbed the gut microbiota, triggering the classical NF-κB signaling pathway and resulting in downstream pathological toxicity associated with inflammatory responses, histological damage, inhibited ingestion, and decreased survival. These effects were dose-dependent and sex-specific, as female zebrafish were more susceptible than male zebrafish. Furthermore, we found that BAC induced toxicity to a greater extent than the restricted TCS at environmentally relevant concentrations, which is particularly concerning. Our results suggest that environmental exposure to antimicrobial chemicals can have ecological consequences by perturbing the gut microbiota, a previously underappreciated target of such chemicals.

However, their adsorption behaviors are usually compromised at ambient conditions, attributed to the competitive VOCs adsorption with water vapor. In this study, we demonstrated that the selectivity for toluene than water of carbon can be effectively enhanced by introducing more sp2-carbon with two-dimensional nanosheets stacked. The multilayer carbon nanosheets enriched with sp2-carbon (CNS-MCA) exhibit a 151° H2O-contact angle, indicating hydrophobicity.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, static adsorption studies, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and time-resolved in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy collectively indicate that toluene exhibits enhanced adsorption and selectivity due to π–π* interactions between its aromatic rings and the sp2-carbon.

The highly bioavailable metals in atmospheric deposition significantly increased the soil DGT-measured bioavailable fraction; yet, this fraction rapidly aged following a first-order exponential decay model, leading to similar percentages of the bioavailable fraction in soils exposed for 1–3 years. The enrichment of light Cd isotopes in the atmospheric deposition resulted in a significant shift toward lighter Cd isotopes in rice plants.

Two libraries with 121 and 118 fingerprints were established, and 247 bioactive compounds were identified at confidence level 2 or 3 in sediment extract using GC-qToF-MS. Among them, 12 toxicants were analytically confirmed using reference standards. Collectively, we present a “bioactivity-signature-toxicant” strategy to deconvolute mixtures and to connect patchy data sets and guide nontarget analysis for diverse chemicals that elicit the same bioactivity."

The cytochrome P450 105 enzyme family has been proven to play an important role in the degradation of exogenous environmental pollutants. However, its thermostability and catalytic activity still need to be improved to better adapt to complex environmental conditions. This work elucidates the key mechanisms and important residues of the degradation reaction through multiple computational strategies, establishes a mutation library, and obtains 21 single-point mutation designs. Experimental verification showed that 16 single mutants had enhanced thermostability, with the R89F and L197Y mutants showing the highest increases in thermostability at 135 and 119% relative to the wild-type enzyme, respectively. Additionally, as a result of the higher specific activity of D390Q, it was selected for combination mutagenesis, ultimately resulting in three combination mutants (R89F/L197Y, R89F/D390Q, and R89F/L197Y/D390Q) with enhanced thermostability and catalytic activity.

In order to develop an intelligent early warning system for HABs, big data and deep learning models were harnessed in this study. Data collection was achieved utilizing the vertical aquatic monitoring system (VAMS). Subsequently, the analysis and stratification of the vertical aquatic layer were conducted employing the “DeepDPM-Spectral Clustering” method. This approach drastically reduced the number of predictive models and enhanced the adaptability of the system. The Bloomformer-2 model was developed to conduct both single-step and multistep predictions of Chl-a, integrating the ” Alert Level Framework” issued by the World Health Organization to accomplish early warning for HABs. The case study conducted in Taihu Lake revealed that during the winter of 2018, the water column could be partitioned into four clusters (Groups W1–W4), while in the summer of 2019, the water column could be partitioned into five clusters (Groups S1–S5). Moreover, in a subsequent predictive task, Bloomformer-2 exhibited superiority in performance across all clusters for both the winter of 2018 and the summer of 2019 (MAE: 0.175–0.394, MSE: 0.042–0.305, and MAPE: 0.228–2.279 for single-step prediction; MAE: 0.184–0.505, MSE: 0.101–0.378, and MAPE: 0.243–4.011 for multistep prediction). The prediction for the 3 days indicated that Group W1 was in a Level I alert state at all times. Conversely, Group S1 was mainly under an Level I alert, with seven specific time points escalating to a Level II alert. Furthermore, the end-to-end architecture of this system, coupled with the automation of its various processes, minimized human intervention, endowing it with intelligent characteristics. This research highlights the transformative potential of integrating big data and artificial intelligence in environmental management and emphasizes the importance of model interpretability in machine learning applications."

Nevertheless, the role of coexistent H2O2 in the transformation from Cu(II) to Cu(I) remained contentious. Herein, with the Cu(II)/PAA process as an example, the respective roles of PAA and H2O2 on the Cu(II)/Cu(I) cycling were comprehensively investigated over the pH range of 7.0–10.5. Contrary to previous studies, it was surprisingly found that the coexistent deprotonated H2O2 (HO2–), instead of PAA, was crucial for accelerating the transformation from Cu(II) to Cu(I) (kHO2–/Cu(II) = (0.17–1) × 106 M–1 s–1, kPAA/Cu(II) < 2.33 ± 0.3 M–1 s–1). Subsequently, the formed Cu(I) preferentially reacted with PAA (kPAA/Cu(I) = (5.84 ± 0.17) × 102 M–1 s–1), rather than H2O2 (kH2O2/Cu(I) = (5.00 ± 0.2) × 101 M–1 s–1), generating reactive species to oxidize organic contaminants. With naproxen as the target pollutant, the proposed synergistic role of H2O2 and PAA was found to be highly dependent on the solution pH with weakly alkaline conditions being more conducive to naproxen degradation. Overall, this study systematically investigated the overlooked but crucial role of coexistent H2O2 in the Cu(II)/PAA process, which might provide valuable insights for better understanding the underlying mechanism in Cu-catalyzed PAA processes."

Machine learning has been previously used to identify compounds based on SERS spectral data. However, utilization of SERS to quantify concentrations, with or without machine learning, has been difficult due to the spectral intensity being sensitive to confounding factors such as the substrate parameters, orientation of the analyte, and sample preparation technique. Here, we demonstrate an approach for predicting the concentration of sample pollutants from SERS spectra using machine learning. Frequency domain transform methods, including the Fourier and Walsh–Hadamard transforms, are applied to spectral data sets of three analytes (rhodamine 6G, chlorpyrifos, and triclosan), which are then used to train machine learning algorithms. Using standard machine learning models, the concentration of the sample pollutants is predicted with >80% cross-validation accuracy from raw SERS data. A cross-validation accuracy of 85% was achieved using deep learning for a moderately sized data set (∼100 spectra), and 70–80% was achieved for small data sets (∼50 spectra). Performance can be maintained within this range even when combining various sample preparation techniques and environmental media interference. Additionally, as a spectral pretreatment, the Fourier and Hadamard transforms are shown to consistently improve prediction accuracy across multiple data sets. Finally, standard models were shown to accurately identify characteristic peaks of compounds via analysis of their importance scores, further verifying their predictive value."

Generally, concentrations of OPEs in the SML were higher than in the underlying waters. Concentrations in the SML were correlated with the chlorophyll α content for some OPEs, consistent with biogenic surfactants at the SML. The enrichment factors (ratio of concentrations in SML over concentrations in underlying waters) were 5.84 ± 8.97 and 9.10 ± 9.48 for the Atlantic and Southern Oceans, respectively. The average enrichment factors in sea spray aerosols (SSA), estimated using previously reported aerosol-phase concentrations, ranged from 3.69 × 104 to 3.33 × 106. These OPE enrichments in SSA are high and suggest that the formation of SSA, mediated by the enrichment in the SML, could be relevant for many semivolatile organic pollutants.

However, the underlying mechanisms for this are still unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of hydrochar and pyrochar, examining the soil N2O mitigation potential from denitrification, electron shuttle functionality, soil microbial composition, and denitrification genes dynamics. Our results conclusively establish that hydrochar outperforms pyrochar due to its exceptional electron transfer capacity, characterized by higher electron exchange capacity (EEC), abundance of electron-donating moieties and more prevalent electron transfer components. Notably, the lower concentration of persistent free radicals (PFRs) in hydrochar results in unimpeded expression of the nosZ gene, promoting complete denitrification and resulting in reduced N2O emissions. These findings highlight hydrochar’s potential as an electron shuttle and underscore its promise as a superior soil amendment for mitigating N2O emissions compared to pyrochar."

Lacking an obviously oxidizable functional group, alcohols are tacitly assumed to be inert with respect to common water treatment oxidants and favored for their low cost, low toxicity, and miscibility with water. While attempting to duplicate a previous result reporting formaldehyde as a product of dimethylamine chlorination, we found that a substantial amount of formaldehyde was generated when the dimethylamine dosing solution was prepared in methanol but not when it was prepared in water. We further found that under conditions typical of chlorination kinetics experiments, aqueous methanol concentrations as low as 0.4% (v/v) could significantly deplete chlorine compared to methanol-free controls. In the presence of increasing methanol concentrations, chlorine depletion half-lives decreased to ∼4 h at 2% methanol. Finally, we examined the chlorination of five primary alcohols and one secondary alcohol, which all formed the corresponding carbonyls at comparable rates. These findings raise doubts about the routine use of alcohols as carrier solvents for the preparation of stock solutions in research on aqueous chlorination reactions and highlight alcohols as a potential source of aldehyde formation during chlorination."

With a revised National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS, at 9 μg/m3) for particulate matter (PM) in the United States (U.S.), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will likely classify new non-attainment areas due primarily to emissions from RWH. Agencies will use emissions factors (EFs) to develop attainment strategies. Many will rely on EPA modeling platforms based on data from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). The NEI uses RWH EFs based on data from mid-1990’s in-situ studies and a speciation profile from a 2001 study of fireplace emissions. The NEI does not include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for this sector, which plays a key role when assessing climate reduction strategies for the buildings sector. Here, we tested seven wood stoves to determine EFs, representing various vintages and control technologies, using a novel test method that reflects in-use operational settings called the Integrated Duty Cycle. The study measured multiple pollutants concurrently: criteria pollutants (particulate matter [PM], CO, and NOx), nonmethane total hydrocarbons (NMTHCs), GHGs, black carbon (eBC), brown carbon (BrC), and multiple hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). We found no significant difference in PM EFs between uncertified and non-catalytic stove technologies. RWH EF results from this study exceeded 2020 NEI RWH EFs for NMTHC and multiple HAPs. Applying our study’s EFs to the 2020 NEI suggests that RWH, compared to all other sources, ranks as the 2nd largest source category of formaldehyde; the 3rd largest of benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and acrolein; and the 4th largest of Pb emissions. RWH also emits more methane compared to natural gas or oil residential heating, raising questions about substitution of wood as a climate neutral heating fuel. However, compared to uncertified stoves, pellet stove EFs (except toxic metals) were significantly lower (p < 0.01). In summary, RWH appears to be an underestimated source of PM (non-catalytic technology), methane, NMTHC, toxic metals, and other HAPs, which has important implications for climate and public health policy in the U.S. and globally."

At the Chemical Assessments of Surfaces and Air (CASA) campaign, we performed controlled additions of ammonia (reaching up to 297 ppb to 662 ppb) to investigate the impacts of changing surface basicity on the fate of gaseous and particulate acids and bases in an unoccupied house. In response to ammonia injections, nitrogen-containing compounds (C2–7H3–11N1O0–3) were emitted from surfaces to the gas phase with signals increasing 101% to 104% compared to their signals prior to ammonia addition. At the same time, oxygen-containing compounds (C1–7H2–6O2–3) were removed from the gas phase by indoor surface partitioning. Indoor surface pH and aerosol pH likely increased during these controlled ammonia injections relative to their baseline conditions. We estimate indoor surface pH to be nearly 5 and indoor aerosol pH to range from 2 to 4 during this experiment. At each ammonia injection, we observed ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the aerosol phase to increase due to gas-particle partitioning of ammonia and nitric acid. This gas-particle-surface exchange showed strong dependence on relative humidity; evaporation of gaseous bases was more pronounced at lower relative humidity when surface-associated water volume was reduced, while gas-to-particle partitioning of inorganic species was greater in the presence of more aerosol liquid water at higher relative humidity. From cooking experiments, which represent realistic sources of acids and bases to the indoor environment but which emit 10 times less ammonia than was introduced to the house via pure ammonia injection experiments, we predict that surfaces may still be important sources of these basic gases to indoor air."

These infections are highly prevalent and are often linked to waterborne diseases. Due to the absence of regulations for monitoring these protozoa at the discharge points of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the effluents reaching surface waters contribute to waterborne transmission. This underscores the significance of the removal capacities of WWTPs in reducing the spread of these infectious parasites. Therefore, this study examined five different types of WWTPs in Ankara, Turkey, over a year to assess their capacities to remove E. histolytica and B. hominis. The seasonal abundances of genes specific to these protozoa in both the influents and effluents of each WWTP were measured using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The reduction in the number of protozoan rDNA copies between the influent and effluent samples was evaluated as the removal capacity, expressed in log10 reduction (LRV) values. The results elucidated that the removal of E. histolytica and B. hominis was highly affected by the process used. Membrane bioreactor systems displayed the highest removal capacity with LRV > 3.

Nonetheless, how prenatal exposure to metals eventually results in long-term effects on the gut microbiome, leading to subclinical intestinal inflammation, particularly during late childhood, has not been studied. It is also unknown whether such an interactive effect drives a specific subgroup of children toward elevated susceptibility to intestinal inflammation. We used an amalgamation of machine-learning techniques with a regression-based framework to explore if children with distinct sets of gut microbes and certain patterns of exposure to metals during pregnancy (metal–microbial clique signature) had a higher likelihood of intestinal inflammation, measured based on fecal calprotectin (FC) in late childhood. We obtained samples from a well-characterized longitudinal birth cohort from Mexico City (n = 108), Mexico. In the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, 11 metals were measured in whole blood. Gut microbial abundances and FC were measured in stool samples from children 9–11 years of age. Elevated FC was defined as having FC above 100 μg/g of stool. We identified subgroups of children in whom microbial and metal–microbial clique signatures were associated with elevated FC (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). In particular, we found two metal–microbial clique signatures significantly associated with elevated FC: (1) low cesium (Cs) and copper (Cu) in the third trimester and low relative abundance of Eubacterium ventriosum (OR [95%CI]: 10.27 [3.57,29.52], FDR < 0.001) and (2) low Cu in the third trimester and high relative abundances of Roseburia inulinivorans and Ruminococcus torques (OR [95%CI]: 7.21 [1.81,28.77], FDR < 0.05). This exploratory study demonstrates that children with specific gut microbes and specific exposure patterns to metals during pregnancy may have higher fecal calprotectin levels in late childhood, denoting an elevated risk of intestinal inflammation."

Moreover, it is worth noting that making chemicals safe and sustainable is crucial to bringing them to the market. To address this, we propose a novel deep learning framework developed explicitly for inverse design of molecules with both functionality and biocompatibility. This innovative approach comprises two predictive models and one generative model, facilitating the targeted screening of novel molecules from created virtual chemical space. Our method’s versatility is highlighted in the inverse design process, where it successfully generates molecules with specified motifs or composition, discovers synthetically accessible molecules, and jointly targets functional and safe properties beyond the training regime. The utility of this method is demonstrated in its ability to design ionic liquids (ILs) with enhanced antibacterial properties and reduced cytotoxicity, addressing the issue of balancing functionality and biocompatibility in molecular design."

However, the types of reproductive hormones associated with DEHP vary across the studies. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to pool existing epidemiological evidence. We searched three databases up to January 31, 2024, for eligible original studies to ultimately include 37 studies from eight countries with a total of 28 911 participants. DEHP exposure was evaluated with urinary metabolites. Since the main types, production sites, blood concentrations, and functions of reproductive hormones differ between men and women, we reported the combined effect values by gender. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, subfertility status, and the national sociodemographic index (SDI) level. Furthermore, the effect of maternal exposure during pregnancy on children’s reproductive hormone levels was analyzed separately. Overall, in general, in men, DEHP was positively correlated with sex hormone binding-globulin (SHBG) and adversely correlated with total testosterone (TT), free androgen index (FAI), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Results indicated that among men of reproductive age, DEHP exposure was associated with more significant hormonal suppression in infertile men compared with fertile men. Notably, age subgroup analysis among women revealed that postmenopausal women were more vulnerable to DEHP, which was related to lower TT and estradiol (E2). However, this study did not observe a significant association between prenatal DEHP metabolites and reproductive hormone levels in children. Our research identifies the most susceptible hormones (androgen suppression) after DEHP exposure and suggests that infertile men and postmenopausal women are in great need of more attention as sensitive populations."

However, epidemiological evidence on the mediating role of maternal thyroid hormones is limited. Therefore, this study, based on the Compliance Birth Cohort, aimed to reveal the potential mediating function of maternal thyroid hormones during pregnancy between phthalic acid ester (PAE) exposure and neonatal birth weight. The study included 1274 mother–infant pairs. Linear regression analysis revealed a negative association between MIBP and neonatal birth weight (β = −62.236; 95% CI: −118.842, −5.631). Bayesian kernel-machine regression (BKMR) indicated a nonlinear negative association between PAE metabolites (PAEs) and birth weight. Linear regression analysis revealed a positive association between neonatal birth weight and FT3 (β = 41.605; 95% CI: 2.631, 80.380). The BKMR model also found a positive association between thyroid hormones and birth weight but in a nonlinear manner. Additionally, linear regression analyses showed that TSH, TT3, TT4, FT3, and FT4 were associated with PAEs. The BKMR model revealed an inverted U-shaped association of PAEs with TT3 and FT3 and a nonlinear association with TSH, TT4, and FT4. Structural equation modeling revealed that MMP, MIBP, MBP, MEHP, MOP, MBZP, and MEOHP contributed to a net reduction in neonatal birth weight of 32 g through the TT3, FT3, TT4, and FT4 pathways. The findings suggest that exposure to PAEs during pregnancy leads to a reduction in neonatal birth weight, possibly due to the involvement of maternal thyroid hormones as mediators. Controlling maternal thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy may be a viable method to reduce the harmful effects of phthalate exposure on the developing fetus."

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between dioxin andgestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), calculate the benchmark dose (BMD) of dioxin in coexposure scenarios, and derive a daily exposure threshold using an optimized physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model. Based on a nested case-control study including 77 cases with GDM and 154 controls, serum levels of 29 dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) along with 10 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), seven polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and five non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (ndl-PCBs) were measured at 9–16 weeks of gestation. Bayesian machine kernel regression (BKMR) was employed to identify significant chemicals, and probit and logistic models were used to calculate BMD adjusted for significant chemicals. A physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model was optimized using polyfluorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PFDD/Fs) data by the Bayesian–Monte Carlo Markov chain method and was used to determine the daily dietary exposure threshold. The median serum level of total dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) was 7.72 pg TEQ/g fat. Logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals in the fifth quantile of total TEQ level had significantly higher odds of developing GDM compared to those in the first quantile (OR, 8.87; 95% CI 3.19, 27.58). The BKMR analysis identified dioxin TEQ and BDE-153 as the compounds with the greatest influence. The binary logistic and probit models showed that the BMD10 (benchmark dose corresponding to a 10% extra risk) and BMDL10 (lower bound on the BMD10) were 3.71 and 3.46 pg TEQ/g fat, respectively, when accounting for coexposure to BDE-153 up to the 80% level. Using the optimized PBTK model and modifying factor, it was estimated that daily exposure should be below 4.34 pg TEQ kg–1 bw week–1 in order to not reach a harmful serum concentration for GDM.

The lipophilic HOPs included polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and dechlorane plus (DPs), while the proteinophilic HOPs included perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). The results revealed that most of lipophilic HOPs exhibit lower depuration rate (kd) than PFCAs. The kd of lipophilic HOPs correlated with the octanol–water partition coefficient (log KOW) values in a V-shaped curve, whereas that of PFCAs correlated with the protein–water partition coefficient (log KPW) values in an inverted V-shaped curve. The depuration rate, rather than the uptake rate, was a leading factor in determining the bioaccumulation potential of HOPs in hens. Although the dominant factors determining the tissue distribution of the two types of compounds were explicit (fats vs phospholipids), chemical-specific tissue distribution was still observed. The egg-maternal concentration ratio was dependent on the exposure status, concentration, and maternal tissue choice. Using a single maternal tissue may not be an appropriate method for assessing chemical maternal transfer potential. PFCAs have a greater maternal transfer potential (>80% of the total body burden) than lipophilic HOPs (approximately 30% for BDE209 and DPs, and less than 10% for the others). Their lipophilic and partly proteinophilic nature makes the toxicokinetics and maternal transfer characteristics of BDE209 and DPs different from those of other lipophilic HOPs.

Understanding the mechanistic and quantitative aspects of OC delivery and preservation in marine sediments is critical for predicting the role of the oceans in modulating global climate. Yet, estimates of the global OC sedimentation in marginal settings span an order of magnitude, and the primary controls of OC preservation remain highly debated. Here, we provide the first global bottom‐up estimate of OC sedimentation along the margins using a synthesis of literature data. We quantify both terrestrial‐ and marine‐sourced OC fluxes and perform a statistical analysis to discern the key factors influencing their magnitude. We find that the margins host 23.2 ± 3.5 Tmol of OC sedimentation annually, with approximately 84% of marine origin. Accordingly, we calculate that only 2%–3% of OC exported from the euphotic zone escapes remineralization before sedimentation. Surprisingly, over half of all global OC sedimentation occurs below bottom waters with oxygen concentrations greater than 180 μM, while less than 4% occurs in settings with <50 μM oxygen. This challenges the prevailing paradigm that bottom‐water oxygen (BWO) is the primary control on OC preservation. Instead, our statistical analysis reveals that water depth is the most significant predictor of OC sedimentation, surpassing all other factors investigated, including BWO levels and sea‐surface chlorophyll concentrations. This finding suggests that the primary control on OC sedimentation is not production, but the ability of OC to resist remineralization during transit through the water column and while settling on the seafloor."

The samples include a sulfate‐ and clay‐bearing mudstone and sandstone, a fluvial sandstone from a stratigraphically low position at the fan front, and a carbonate‐bearing sandstone deposited above the sulfate‐bearing strata. All samples contain aqueously precipitated materials and most or all were aqueously deposited. Although the rover instruments have not confidently detected organic matter in the rocks from the fan front, the much more sensitive terrestrial instruments will still be able to search for remnants of prebiotic chemistries and past life, and study Mars's past habitability in the samples returned to Earth. The hydrated, sulfate‐bearing mudstone has the highest potential to preserve organic matter and biosignatures, whereas the carbonate‐bearing sandstones can be used to constrain when and for how long Jezero crater contained liquid water. Returned sample science analyses of sulfate, carbonate, clay, phosphate and igneous minerals as well as trace metals and volatiles that are present in the samples acquired at the fan front would provide transformative insights into past habitable environments on Mars, the evolution of its magnetic field, atmosphere and climate and the past and present cycling of atmospheric and crustal water, sulfur and carbon."

The largest amplitude arrivals are linked to scattering at small‐scale lowermost mantle structure, but because these arrivals traverse both source and receiver sides of the mantle, it is unknown which side of the path the energy is scattered from. To address this ambiguity, we apply a new seismic array method to analyze PKP waveforms from 58 earthquakes recorded in North America that allows localization of the origin of the PKP precursors at the core‐mantle boundary (CMB). We compare these measurements with high frequency 2.5‐D synthetic predictions showing that the PKP precursors are most likely associated with ultra‐low velocity zone structures beneath the western Pacific and North America. The most feasible scenario to generate ULVZs in both locations is through melting of mid‐ocean ridge basalt in subducted oceanic crust."

Silva,Carbon‐Water Tradeoffs in Old‐Growth and Young Forests of the Pacific Northwest,"Despite much interest in relationships among carbon and water in forests, few studies assess how carbon accumulation scales with water use in forested watersheds with varied histories. This study quantified tree growth, water use efficiency, and carbon‐water tradeoffs of young versus mature/old‐growth forest in three small (13–22 ha) watersheds in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. To quantify and scale carbon‐water tradeoffs from trees to watersheds, tree‐ring records and greenness and wetness indices from remote sensing were combined with long‐term vegetation, climate, and streamflow data from young forest watersheds (trees ∼45 years of age) and from a mature/old‐growth forest watershed (trees 150–500 years of age). Biomass production was closely related to water use; water use efficiency (basal area increment per unit of evapotranspiration) was lower; and carbon‐water tradeoffs were steeper in young forest plantations compared with old‐growth forest for which the tree growth record begins in the 1850s. Greenness and wetness indices from Landsat imagery were not significant predictors of streamflow or tree growth over the period 1984 to 2017, and soil C and N did not differ significantly among watersheds. Multiple lines of evidence show that mature and old‐growth forest watersheds store and accumulate more carbon, are more drought resistant, and better sustain water availability compared to young forests. These results provide a basis for reconstructions and predictions that are potentially broadly applicable, because first‐order watersheds occupy 80%–90% of large river basins and study watersheds are representative of forest history in the Pacific Northwest region."

However, the coevolution of permafrost, river dynamics, and vegetation in Arctic environments remains poorly understood. As rivers meander, they erode the floodplain at cutbanks and build new land through bar deposition, creating sequences of landforms with distinct formation ages. Here we mapped these sequences along the Koyukuk River floodplain, Alaska, analyzing permafrost occurrence, and landform and vegetation types. We used radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to develop a floodplain age map. Deposit ages ranged from modern to 10 ka, with more younger deposits near the modern channel. Permafrost rapidly reached 50% areal extent in all deposits older than 200 years then gradually increased up to ∼85% extent for deposits greater than 4 Kyr old. Permafrost extent correlated with increases in black spruce and wetland abundance, as well as increases in permafrost extent within wetland, and shrub and scrub vegetation classes. We developed an inverse model to constrain permafrost formation rate as a function of air temperature. Permafrost extent initially increased by ∼25% per century, in pace with vegetation succession, before decelerating to <10% per millennia as insulating overbank mud and moss slowly accumulated. Modern permafrost extent on the Koyukuk floodplain therefore reflects a dynamic balance between widespread, time‐varying permafrost formation and rapid, localized degradation due to cutbank erosion that might trigger a rapid loss of permafrost with climatic warming."

Presently, measures of the in‐situ distribution of fault damage remain limited and along‐strike studies are rare. This study focuses on an offshore section Palos Verdes Fault damage zone that spans 28 km, near Los Angeles, California. To investigate the previously unresolved shallow (∼400 m below the seafloor) fault damage zone we use densely spaced (∼500 m line separation) newly collected sparker multichannel seismic lines and sub‐bottom profiles. The combination of high‐resolution acquisition methods and specialized seismic processing workflows provide improved imaging of shallow faulting. We apply a multi‐trace similarity technique to identify discontinuities in the seismic data that may be attributed to faults and fractures. This fault detection approach reveals diverse fault damage patterns on adjacent seismic profiles. However, a discernible damage zone pattern emerges by stacking multiple damage detection profiles along strike. We find that peak damage identified in this way corresponds to the active main fault strand, confirmed in this study, and thus the technique may be useful for identifying active fault strands elsewhere. Additionally, we observe that the variable width of the damage zone along strike is controlled by fault obliquity. Furthermore, our observations reveal a correlation between fault damage and seafloor fluid seeps visible in the water column, suggesting that damage plays a role in controlling fluid flow around the fault."

Guevara,Evolving Subduction Zone Thermal Structure Drives Extensive Forearc Mantle Wedge Hydration,"Hydration of the subduction zone forearc mantle wedge influences the downdip distribution of seismicity, the availability of fluids for arc magmatism, and Earth's long term water cycle. Reconstructions of present‐day subduction zone thermal structures using time‐invariant geodynamic models indicate relatively minor hydration, in contrast to many geophysical and geologic observations. We pair a dynamic, time‐evolving thermal model of subduction with phase equilibria modeling to investigate how variations in slab and forearc temperatures from subduction infancy through to maturity contribute to mantle wedge hydration. We find that thermal state during the intermediate period of subduction, as the slab freely descends through the upper mantle, promotes extensive forearc wedge hydration. In contrast, during early subduction the forearc is too hot to stabilize hydrous minerals in the mantle wedge, while during mature subduction, slab dehydration dominantly occurs beyond forearc depths. In our models, maximum wedge hydration during the intermediate phase is 60%–70% and falls to 20%–40% as quasi‐steady state conditions are approached during maturity. Comparison to global forearc H2O capacities reveals that consideration of thermal evolution leads to an order of magnitude increase in estimates for current extents of wedge hydration and provides better agreement with geophysical observations. This suggests that hydration of the forearc mantle wedge represents a potential vast reservoir of H2O, on the order of 3.4–5.9 × 1021 g globally. These results provide novel insights into the subduction zone water cycle, new constraints on the mantle wedge as a fluid reservoir and are useful to better understand geologic processes at plate margins."

We show that six seamounts located in and around the Magellan Seamount chain—north of the Ontong‐Java Plateau (OJP)—have ages (87–106 Ma), geochemistry, and locations consistent with absolute plate motion model reconstructions of the Samoan hotspot track in the late Cretaceous, and three additional seamounts have geochemistry and locations consistent with a Samoan origin. However, a large segment of the Samoan hotspot (24–87 Ma) remains unidentified. Absolute plate motion models show that, from ∼60 to 30 Ma, the OJP passed over the Samoan plume. The exceptional thickness of the OJP lithosphere may have largely suppressed Samoan plume melting because the inferred volcanic trace of the Samoan hotspot wanes, and then disappears, on the OJP. Fortunately, 44 Ma volcanism at Malaita Island, located on the southern margin of the OJP, has a location, age, and geochemistry consistent with a Samoan plume origin, and provides a “missing link” bridging the younger and older segments of the Samoan hotspot. Our synthesis of geochemical, geochronological, and plate motion model evidence reveals that Samoa exhibits a clear hotspot age progression for over 100 Myr. Passage of ancient plateaus over young plumes—here called “plume‐plateau” interaction—may be relatively common: the OJP also passed over the putative Rarotonga hotspot, and the Society and Pitcairn hotspots were overtopped by the Manihiki Plateau."

Increased resolution may help simulate realistic tropical cyclone intensification. We examined fully coupled, global storm‐resolving models run at resolutions in the range 28–2.8 km in the atmosphere and 28–5 km in the ocean. Simulated tropical cyclone activity, peak intensity, intensification rate, and horizontal wind structure are all more realistic at a resolution of ∼5 km compared with coarser resolutions. Rapid intensification, which is absent at typical climate model resolutions, is also captured, and exhibits sensitivity to how, and if, deep convection is parameterized. Additionally, the observed decrease in inner‐core horizontal size with increasing intensification rate is captured at storm‐resolving resolution. These findings highlight the importance of global storm‐resolving models for quantifying risk and understanding the role of intense tropical cyclones in the climate system."

While semi-synthetic methods leveraging the functional groups found in polar and aromatic amino acids have been extensively explored, highly selective and general approaches to transform unactivated C–H bonds in aliphatic amino acids remain less developed4,5 Here, we disclose a stepwise dehydrogenative method to convert aliphatic amino acids into structurally diverse analogs. The key to the success of this approach lies in the development of a selective catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation method driven by photochemical irradiation, which provides access to terminal alkene intermediates for downstream functionalization. Overall, this strategy enables the rapid synthesis of new amino acid building blocks and suggests possibilities for the late-stage modification of more complex oligopeptides."

 Numerous correlated many-body phases, both conventional and exotic, have been reported in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)1–24. However, the dynamics associated with these correlated states, crucial for understanding the underlying physics, remain unexplored. Here we combine exciton sensing and optical pump–probe spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of isospin orders in MATBG with WSe2 substrate across the entire flat band, achieving sub-picosecond resolution. We observe remarkably slow isospin dynamics in a broad filling range around ν = 2 and between ν = −3 and −2, with lifetimes of up to 300 ps that decouple from the much faster cooling of electronic temperature (about 10 ps). This non-thermal behaviour demonstrates the presence of abnormally long-lived modes in the isospin degrees of freedom. This observation, not anticipated by theory, implies the existence of long-range propagating collective modes, strong isospin fluctuations and memory effects and is probably associated with an intervalley coherent or incommensurate Kekulé spiral ground state. We further demonstrate non-equilibrium control of the isospin orders previously found around integer fillings. Specifically, through ultrafast manipulation, it can be transiently shifted away from integer fillings. Our study demonstrates a unique probe of collective excitations in MATBG and paves the way for actively controlling non-equilibrium phenomena in moiré systems.

Using a scanning tunnelling microscope equipped with a three-axis vector magnet, we found that the zero-bias peak (ZBP) in a single vortex exhibits an apparent anisotropic response even though the magnetic field is weak. The ZBP can robustly extend a long distance of up to approximately 100 nm at the (001) surface when the magnetic field is parallel to the (

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has recently been associated with diverse cell states1–11, yet when and how these states affect the onset of AD remains unclear. Here we used a data-driven approach to reconstruct the dynamics of the brain’s cellular environment and identified a trajectory leading to AD that is distinct from other ageing-related effects. First, we built a comprehensive cell atlas of the aged prefrontal cortex from 1.65 million single-nucleus RNA-sequencing profiles sampled from 437 older individuals, and identified specific glial and neuronal subpopulations associated with AD-related traits. Causal modelling then prioritized two distinct lipid-associated microglial subpopulations—one drives amyloid-β proteinopathy while the other mediates the effect of amyloid-β on tau proteinopathy—as well as an astrocyte subpopulation that mediates the effect of tau on cognitive decline. To model the dynamics of cellular environments, we devised the BEYOND methodology, which identified two distinct trajectories of brain ageing, each defined by coordinated progressive changes in certain cellular communities that lead to (1) AD dementia or (2) alternative brain ageing.

 Romantic engagement can bias sensory perception. This ‘love blindness’ reflects a common behavioural principle across organisms: favouring pursuit of a coveted reward over potential risks1. In the case of animal courtship, such sensory biases may support reproductive success but can also expose individuals to danger, such as predation2,3. However, how neural networks balance the trade-off between risk and reward is unknown. Here we discover a dopamine-governed filter mechanism in male Drosophila that reduces threat perception as courtship progresses. We show that during early courtship stages, threat-activated visual neurons inhibit central courtship nodes via specific serotonergic neurons. This serotonergic inhibition prompts flies to abort courtship when they see imminent danger. However, as flies advance in the courtship process, the dopaminergic filter system reduces visual threat responses, shifting the balance from survival to mating. By recording neural activity from males as they approach mating, we demonstrate that progress in courtship is registered as dopaminergic activity levels ramping up. This dopamine signalling inhibits the visual threat detection pathway via Dop2R receptors, allowing male flies to focus on courtship when they are close to copulation. Thus, dopamine signalling biases sensory perception based on perceived goal proximity, to prioritize between competing behaviours. A state-dependent dopamine filter system in the male Drosophila brain balances threat perception against the drive to mate."

 Spatial learning in teleost fish requires an intact telencephalon1, a brain region that contains putative analogues to components of the mammalian limbic system (for example, hippocampus)2–4. However, cells fundamental to spatial cognition in mammals—for example, place cells (PCs)5,6—have yet to be established in any fish species. In this study, using tracking microscopy to record brain-wide calcium activity in freely swimming larval zebrafish7, we compute the spatial information content8 of each neuron across the brain. Strikingly, in every recorded animal, cells with the highest spatial specificity were enriched in the zebrafish telencephalon. These PCs form a population code of space from which we can decode the animal’s spatial location across time. By continuous recording of population-level activity, we found that the activity manifold of PCs refines and untangles over time. Through systematic manipulation of allothetic and idiothetic cues, we demonstrate that zebrafish PCs integrate multiple sources of information and can flexibly remap to form distinct spatial maps. Using analysis of neighbourhood distance between PCs across environments, we found evidence for a weakly preconfigured network in the telencephalon. The discovery of zebrafish PCs represents a step forward in our understanding of spatial cognition across species and the functional role of the early vertebrate telencephalon.

 Early expansion and long-term persistence predict efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CARTs)1–7, but mechanisms governing effector versus memory CART differentiation and whether asymmetric cell division induces differential fates in human CARTs remain unclear. Here we show that target-induced proximity labelling enables isolation of first-division proximal-daughter and distal-daughter CD8 CARTs that asymmetrically distribute their surface proteome and transcriptome, resulting in divergent fates. Target-engaged CARs remain on proximal daughters, which inherit a surface proteome resembling activated-undivided CARTs, whereas the endogenous T cell receptor and CD8 enrich on distal daughters, whose surface proteome resembles resting CARTs, correlating with glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, respectively. Despite memory-precursor phenotype and in vivo longevity, distal daughters demonstrate transient potent cytolytic activity similar to proximal daughters, uncovering an effector-like state in distal daughters destined to become memory CARTs. Both partitioning of pre-existing transcripts and changes in RNA velocity contribute to asymmetry of fate-determining factors, resulting in diametrically opposed transcriptional trajectories. Independent of naive, memory or effector surface immunophenotype, proximal-daughter CARTs use core sets of transcription factors known to support proliferation and effector function. Conversely, transcription factors enriched in distal daughters restrain differentiation and promote longevity, evidenced by diminished long-term in vivo persistence and function of distal-daughter CARTs after IKZF1 disruption. These studies establish asymmetric cell division as a framework for understanding mechanisms of CART differentiation and improving therapeutic outcomes. We show that target-induced proximity labelling enables isolation of first-division CD8 chimeric antigen receptor T cells that asymmetrically distribute their surface proteome and transcriptome, resulting in distinct phenotypic, metabolic and functional profiles in proximal and distal daughter cells."

 Sterile inflammation after myocardial infarction is classically credited to myeloid cells interacting with dead cell debris in the infarct zone1,2. Here we show that cardiomyocytes are the dominant initiators of a previously undescribed type I interferon response in the infarct borderzone. Using spatial transcriptomics analysis in mice and humans, we find that myocardial infarction induces colonies of interferon-induced cells (IFNICs) expressing interferon-stimulated genes decorating the borderzone, where cardiomyocytes experience mechanical stress, nuclear rupture and escape of chromosomal DNA. Cardiomyocyte-selective deletion of Irf3 abrogated IFNIC colonies, whereas mice lacking Irf3 in fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils or endothelial cells, Ccr2-deficient mice or plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-depleted mice did not. Interferons blunted the protective matricellular programs and contractile function of borderzone fibroblasts, and increased vulnerability to pathological remodelling. In mice that died after myocardial infarction, IFNIC colonies were immediately adjacent to sites of ventricular rupture, while mice lacking IFNICs were protected from rupture and exhibited improved survival3. Together, these results reveal a pathological borderzone niche characterized by a cardiomyocyte-initiated innate immune response. We suggest that selective inhibition of IRF3 activation in non-immune cells could limit ischaemic cardiomyopathy while avoiding broad immunosuppression.

 Faithful DNA replication is essential for genome integrity1–4. Under-replicated DNA leads to defects in chromosome segregation, which are common during embryogenesis5–8. However, the regulation of DNA replication remains poorly understood in early mammalian embryos. Here we constructed a single-cell genome-wide DNA replication atlas of pre-implantation mouse embryos and identified an abrupt replication program switch accompanied by a transient period of genomic instability. In 1- and 2-cell embryos, we observed the complete absence of a replication timing program, and the entire genome replicated gradually and uniformly using extremely slow-moving replication forks. In 4-cell embryos, a somatic-cell-like replication timing program commenced abruptly. However, the fork speed was still slow, S phase was extended, and markers of replication stress, DNA damage and repair increased. This was followed by an increase in break-type chromosome segregation errors specifically during the 4-to-8-cell division with breakpoints enriched in late-replicating regions. These errors were rescued by nucleoside supplementation, which accelerated fork speed and reduced the replication stress. By the 8-cell stage, forks gained speed, S phase was no longer extended and chromosome aberrations decreased. Thus, a transient period of genomic instability exists during normal mouse development, preceded by an S phase lacking coordination between replisome-level regulation and megabase-scale replication timing regulation, implicating a link between their coordination and genome stability.

 Superconductivity in a highly correlated kagome system has been theoretically proposed for years (refs. 1–5), yet the experimental realization is hard to achieve6,7. The recently discovered vanadium-based kagome materials8, which exhibit both superconductivity9–11 and charge-density-wave orders12–14, are nonmagnetic8,9 and weakly correlated15,16. Thus these materials are unlikely to host the exotic superconductivity theoretically proposed. Here we report the discovery of a chromium-based kagome metal, CsCr3Sb5, which is contrastingly featured with strong electron correlations, frustrated magnetism and characteristic flat bands close to the Fermi level. Under ambient pressure, this kagome metal undergoes a concurrent structural and magnetic phase transition at 55 K, with a stripe-like 4a0 structural modulation. At high pressure, the phase transition evolves into two transitions, possibly associated with charge-density-wave and antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave orderings. These density-wave-like orders are gradually suppressed with pressure and, remarkably, a superconducting dome emerges at 3.65–8.0 GPa. The maximum of the superconducting transition temperature, Tcmax = 6.4 K, appears when the density-wave-like orders are completely suppressed at 4.2 GPa, and the normal state exhibits a non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, reminiscent of unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality in iron-based superconductors17,18. Our work offers an unprecedented platform for investigating superconductivity in correlated kagome systems.

 Early plant responses to different stress situations often encompass cytosolic Ca2+ increases, plasma membrane depolarization and the generation of reactive oxygen species1–3. However, the mechanisms by which these signalling elements are translated into defined physiological outcomes are poorly understood. Here, to study the basis for encoding of specificity in plant signal processing, we used light-gated ion channels (channelrhodopsins). We developed a genetically engineered channelrhodopsin variant called XXM 2.0 with high Ca2+ conductance that enabled triggering cytosolic Ca2+ elevations in planta. Plant responses to light-induced Ca2+ influx through XXM 2.0 were studied side by side with effects caused by an anion efflux through the light-gated anion channelrhodopsin ACR1 2.04. Although both tools triggered membrane depolarizations, their activation led to distinct plant stress responses: XXM 2.0-induced Ca2+ signals stimulated production of reactive oxygen species and defence mechanisms; ACR1 2.0-mediated anion efflux triggered drought stress responses. Our findings imply that discrete Ca2+ signals and anion efflux serve as triggers for specific metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming enabling plants to adapt to particular stress situations. Our optogenetics approach unveiled that within plant leaves, distinct physiological responses are triggered by specific ion fluxes, which are accompanied by similar electrical signals. Using new optogenetic tools to induce distinct ion fluxes, a study shows that these discrete signals trigger different metabolic and transcriptional pathways that allow plants to respond to specific types of stress."

 Crystallographic phase engineering plays an important part in the precise control of the physical and electronic properties of materials. In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs), phase engineering using chemical lithiation with the organometallization agent n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), to convert the semiconducting 2H (trigonal) to the metallic 1T (octahedral) phase, has been widely explored for applications in areas such as transistors, catalysis and batteries1–15. Although this chemical phase engineering can be performed at ambient temperatures and pressures, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and the use of n-BuLi raises notable safety concerns. Here we optically visualize the archetypical phase transition from the 2H to the 1T phase in mono- and bilayer 2D TMDs and discover that this reaction can be accelerated by up to six orders of magnitude using low-power illumination at 455 nm. We identify that the above-gap illumination improves the rate-limiting charge-transfer kinetics through a photoredox process. We use this method to achieve rapid and high-quality phase engineering of TMDs and demonstrate that this methodology can be harnessed to inscribe arbitrary phase patterns with diffraction-limited edge resolution into few-layer TMDs. Finally, we replace pyrophoric n-BuLi with safer polycyclic aromatic organolithiation agents and show that their performance exceeds that of n-BuLi as a phase transition agent. Our work opens opportunities for exploring the in situ characterization of electrochemical processes and paves the way for sustainably scaling up materials and devices by photoredox phase engineering.

 The brain functions as a prediction machine, utilizing an internal model of the world to anticipate sensations and the outcomes of our actions. Discrepancies between expected and actual events, referred to as prediction errors, are leveraged to update the internal model and guide our attention towards unexpected events1–10. Despite the importance of prediction-error signals for various neural computations across the brain, surprisingly little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms responsible for their implementation. Here we describe a thalamocortical disinhibitory circuit that is required for generating sensory prediction-error signals in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We show that violating animals’ predictions by an unexpected visual stimulus preferentially boosts responses of the layer 2/3 V1 neurons that are most selective for that stimulus. Prediction errors specifically amplify the unexpected visual input, rather than representing non-specific surprise or difference signals about how the visual input deviates from the animal’s predictions. This selective amplification is implemented by a cooperative mechanism requiring thalamic input from the pulvinar and cortical vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) inhibitory interneurons. In response to prediction errors, VIP neurons inhibit a specific subpopulation of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons that gate excitatory pulvinar input to V1, resulting in specific pulvinar-driven response amplification of the most stimulus-selective neurons in V1. Therefore, the brain prioritizes unpredicted sensory information by selectively increasing the salience of unpredicted sensory features through the synergistic interaction of thalamic input and neocortical disinhibitory circuits. Experiments in mice show that a cortico-thalamic circuit generates prediction-error signals in primary visual cortex that amplify visual input that deviates from animals’ expectations."

 Hundreds of millions of people now interact with language models, with uses ranging from help with writing1,2 to informing hiring decisions3. However, these language models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making their judgements biased in problematic ways about groups such as African Americans4–7. Although previous research has focused on overt racism in language models, social scientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed over time, particularly in the United States after the civil rights movement8,9. It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the form of dialect prejudice, exhibiting raciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English (AAE) that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded. By contrast, the language models’ overt stereotypes about African Americans are more positive. Dialect prejudice has the potential for harmful consequences: language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of AAE be assigned less-prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes and be sentenced to death. Finally, we show that current practices of alleviating racial bias in language models, such as human preference alignment, exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes, by superficially obscuring the racism that language models maintain on a deeper level. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the fair and safe use of language technology.

 Human mutations in neuropeptide Y (NPY) have been linked to high body mass index but not altered dietary patterns1. Here we uncover the mechanism by which NPY in sympathetic neurons2,3 protects from obesity. Imaging of cleared mouse brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT, respectively) established that NPY+ sympathetic axons are a smaller subset that mostly maps to the perivasculature; analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets identified mural cells as the main NPY-responsive cells in adipose tissues. We show that NPY sustains the proliferation of mural cells, which are a source of thermogenic adipocytes in both BAT and WAT4–6. We found that diet-induced obesity leads to neuropathy of NPY+ axons and concomitant depletion of mural cells. This defect was replicated in mice with NPY abrogated from sympathetic neurons. The loss of NPY in sympathetic neurons whitened interscapular BAT, reducing its thermogenic ability and decreasing energy expenditure before the onset of obesity. It also caused adult-onset obesity of mice fed on a regular chow diet and rendered them more susceptible to diet-induced obesity without increasing food consumption. Our results indicate that, relative to central NPY, peripheral NPY produced by sympathetic nerves has the opposite effect on body weight by sustaining energy expenditure independently of food intake.

 Severe defects in human IFNγ immunity predispose individuals to both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis, whereas milder defects predispose only to tuberculosis1. Here we report two adults with recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis who are homozygous for a private loss-of-function TNF variant. Neither has any other clinical phenotype and both mount normal clinical and biological inflammatory responses. Their leukocytes, including monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) do not produce TNF, even after stimulation with IFNγ. Blood leukocyte subset development is normal in these patients. However, an impairment in the respiratory burst was observed in granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-matured MDMs and alveolar macrophage-like (AML) cells2 from both patients with TNF deficiency, TNF- or TNFR1-deficient induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived GM-CSF-matured macrophages, and healthy control MDMs and AML cells differentiated with TNF blockers in vitro, and in lung macrophages treated with TNF blockers ex vivo. The stimulation of TNF-deficient iPS-cell-derived macrophages with TNF rescued the respiratory burst. These findings contrast with those for patients with inherited complete deficiency of the respiratory burst across all phagocytes, who are prone to multiple infections, including both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis3.

 Fertilization introduces parental genetic information into the zygote to guide embryogenesis. Parental contributions to postfertilization development have been discussed for decades, and the data available show that both parents contribute to the zygotic transcriptome, suggesting a paternal role in early embryogenesis1–6. However, because the specific paternal effects on postfertilization development and the molecular pathways underpinning these effects remain poorly understood, paternal contribution to early embryogenesis and plant development has not yet been adequately demonstrated7. Here our research shows that TREE1 and its homologue DAZ3 are expressed exclusively in Arabidopsis sperm. Despite presenting no evident defects in sperm development and fertilization, tree1 daz3 unexpectedly led to aberrant differentiation of the embryo root stem cell niche. This defect persisted in seedlings and disrupted root tip regeneration, comparable to congenital defects in animals. TREE1 and DAZ3 function by suppression of maternal RKD2 transcription, thus mitigating the detrimental maternal effects from RKD2 on root stem cell niche. Therefore, our findings illuminate how genetic deficiencies in sperm can exert enduring paternal effects on specific plant organ differentiation and how parental-of-origin genes interact to ensure normal embryogenesis. This work also provides a new concept of how gamete quality or genetic deficiency can affect specific plant organ formation.

10.1038/s41586-024-07873-4,False,Nature,这篇论文主要研究了纤维蛋白在新冠病毒感染中驱动炎症和神经病变的作用。研究发现，纤维蛋白与新冠病毒刺突蛋白结合，形成促炎性血栓，进而导致全身性血栓炎症和神经病变。论文还发现，纤维蛋白通过其炎症结构域，在新冠病毒感染后促进肺部氧化应激和巨噬细胞活化，同时抑制自然杀伤细胞。此外，纤维蛋白还促进感染后神经炎症和神经元丢失，以及大脑和肺部的先天免疫激活，而与病毒感染无关。研究人员还开发了一种针对纤维蛋白炎症结构域的单克隆抗体，该抗体可以保护感染后的小胶质细胞活化和神经元损伤，以及肺部的血栓炎症。因此，该研究表明，纤维蛋白在新冠病毒感染中驱动炎症和神经病变，靶向纤维蛋白的免疫治疗可能是治疗急性新冠肺炎和新冠后遗症的潜在方法。,[],Jae Kyu Ryu;Zhaoqi Yan;Mauricio Montano;Elif G.

 Life-threatening thrombotic events and neurological symptoms are prevalent in COVID-19 and are persistent in patients with long COVID experiencing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection1–4. Despite the clinical evidence1,5–7, the underlying mechanisms of coagulopathy in COVID-19 and its consequences in inflammation and neuropathology remain poorly understood and treatment options are insufficient. Fibrinogen, the central structural component of blood clots, is abundantly deposited in the lungs and brains of patients with COVID-19, correlates with disease severity and is a predictive biomarker for post-COVID-19 cognitive deficits1,5,8–10. Here we show that fibrin binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, forming proinflammatory blood clots that drive systemic thromboinflammation and neuropathology in COVID-19. Fibrin, acting through its inflammatory domain, is required for oxidative stress and macrophage activation in the lungs, whereas it suppresses natural killer cells, after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fibrin promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal loss after infection, as well as innate immune activation in the brain and lungs independently of active infection. A monoclonal antibody targeting the inflammatory fibrin domain provides protection from microglial activation and neuronal injury, as well as from thromboinflammation in the lung after infection. Thus, fibrin drives inflammation and neuropathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and fibrin-targeting immunotherapy may represent a therapeutic intervention for patients with acute COVID-19 and long COVID. Fibrin drives inflammation and neuropathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and fibrin-targeting immunotherapy may represent a therapeutic intervention for patients with long COVID."

Jackson,Closed-loop transfer enables artificial intelligence to yield chemical knowledge,"Integration of closed-loop experiments with physics-based feature selection and supervised learning, denoted as closed-loop transfer, yields chemical insights in parallel with optimization of objective functions. 
 Artificial intelligence-guided closed-loop experimentation has emerged as a promising method for optimization of objective functions1,2, but the substantial potential of this traditionally black-box approach to uncovering new chemical knowledge has remained largely untapped. Here we report the integration of closed-loop experiments with physics-based feature selection and supervised learning, denoted as closed-loop transfer (CLT), to yield chemical insights in parallel with optimization of objective functions. CLT was used to examine the factors dictating the photostability in solution of light-harvesting donor–acceptor molecules used in a variety of organic electronics applications, and showed fundamental insights including the importance of high-energy regions of the triplet state manifold. This was possible following automated modular synthesis and experimental characterization of only around 1.5% of the theoretical chemical space. This physics-informed model for photostability was strengthened using multiple experimental test sets and validated by tuning the triplet excited-state energy of the solvent to break out of the observed plateau in the closed-loop photostability optimization process. Further applications of CLT to additional materials systems support the generalizability of this strategy for augmenting closed-loop strategies. Broadly, these findings show that combining interpretable supervised learning models and physics-based features with closed-loop discovery processes can rapidly provide fundamental chemical insights. Integration of closed-loop experiments with physics-based feature selection and supervised learning, denoted as closed-loop transfer, yields chemical insights in parallel with optimization of objective functions."

 The rapid evolution of viruses generates proteins that are essential for infectivity and replication but with unknown functions, due to extreme sequence divergence1. Here, using a database of 67,715 newly predicted protein structures from 4,463 eukaryotic viral species, we found that 62% of viral proteins are structurally distinct and lack homologues in the AlphaFold database2,3. Among the remaining 38% of viral proteins, many have non-viral structural analogues that revealed surprising similarities between human pathogens and their eukaryotic hosts. Structural comparisons suggested putative functions for up to 25% of unannotated viral proteins, including those with roles in the evasion of innate immunity. In particular, RNA ligase T-like phosphodiesterases were found to resemble phage-encoded proteins that hydrolyse the host immune-activating cyclic dinucleotides 3′,3′- and 2′,3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Experimental analysis showed that RNA ligase T homologues encoded by avian poxviruses similarly hydrolyse cGAMP, showing that RNA ligase T-mediated targeting of cGAMP is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of immune evasion that is present in both bacteriophage and eukaryotic viruses. Together, the viral protein structural database and analyses presented here afford new opportunities to identify mechanisms of virus–host interactions that are common across the virome.

 Seafloor anomalies along mid-ocean ridges with exceptionally thick and compositionally distinct basaltic crust, for example, at Iceland, suggest that the underlying mantle is hotter and chemically different from the adjacent subridge mantle. Here we present hafnium and neodymium isotope ratios of peridotites from the Charlie Gibbs Transform Zone, which is located at the southern end of the Reykjanes Ridge south-west of Iceland. These peridotites are strongly depleted in incompatible elements with extremely high hafnium isotope ratios, suggesting that they had already melted to a large extent before being incorporated into the plume, at least 1 billion years ago, and thereby also became less dense. We argue that seismic velocity anomalies, geodynamic models and geochemical affinities of ridge basalts connect the peridotites from the Charlie Gibbs Transform Zone to the ‘Iceland plume’. The thermochemical buoyancy of the moderately hot Iceland plume, but also that of other plumes worldwide, may therefore be strongly influenced by composition. Variable peridotite depletion along the rising Iceland plume could also cause the transient, density-driven pulses in plume flux, which have formed the V-shaped Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland. Overall, expansion of a ridge-centred plume along adjacent ridges and melting of heterogeneous plume material explains the topographic swell, the seismic anomaly and the formation of V-shaped ridges, as well as the regional distribution of basalts with Icelandic affinity.

Palmer,Solid Earth forcing of Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events,"Enhanced chemical weathering following continental breakup may have driven a succession of Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events, according to tectonic and biogeochemical modelling. 
 Oceanic anoxic events are geologically abrupt phases of extreme oxygen depletion in the oceans that disrupted marine ecosystems and brought about evolutionary turnover. Typically lasting ~1.5 million years, these events occurred frequently during the Mesozoic era, from about 183 to 85 million years ago, an interval associated with continental breakup and widespread large igneous province volcanism. One hypothesis suggests that anoxic events resulted from enhanced chemical weathering of Earth’s surface in a greenhouse world shaped by high volcanic carbon outgassing. Here we test this hypothesis using a combination of plate reconstructions, tectonic–geochemical analysis and global biogeochemical modelling. We show that enhanced weathering of mafic lithologies during continental breakup and nascent seafloor spreading can plausibly drive a succession of anoxic events. Weathering pulses collectively gave rise to substantial releases of the nutrient phosphorus to the oceans, stimulating biological primary production. This, in turn, enhanced organic carbon burial and caused widespread ocean deoxygenation on a scale sufficient to drive recurrent anoxia. This model complements volcanic outgassing-centred hypotheses for triggering these events by demonstrating well-quantified basaltic sources of phosphorus release during periods of intense weathering related to climate warmth. Our study highlights a close coupling between the solid Earth and biosphere during continental reorganization. Enhanced chemical weathering following continental breakup may have driven a succession of Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events, according to tectonic and biogeochemical modelling."

 Glaciers archive time-structured information on climates and ecosystems, including microorganisms.

Here we use metagenomes to reconstruct viral genomes from nine time horizons, spanning three cold-to-warm cycles over the past >41,000 years, preserved in an ice core from Guliya Glacier, Tibetan Plateau. We recover genomes of 1,705 approximately species-level viral operational taxonomic units. Viral communities significantly differ during cold and warm climatic conditions, with the most distinct community observed ~11,500 years ago during the major climate transition from the Last Glacial Stage to the Holocene. In silico analyses of virus–host interactions reveal persistently high viral pressure on Flavobacterium (a common dominant glacier lineage) and historical enrichment in the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins that can contribute to host adaptation and virus fitness under extreme conditions. Biogeographic analyses show that approximately one-fourth of Guliya viral operational taxonomic units overlap with the global dataset, primarily with the Tibetan Plateau metagenomes, suggesting regional associations of a subset of the Guliya-preserved viruses over time. We posit that the cold-to-warm variations in viral communities might be attributed to distinct virus sources and/or environmental selections under different temperature regimes.

Here, the authors show that linkers connecting these domains control the carrier’s conformational space and thus its function. 
 Uptake of nucleobases and ascorbate is an essential process in all living organisms mediated by SLC23 transport proteins. These transmembrane carriers operate via the elevator alternating-access mechanism, and are composed of two rigid domains whose relative motion drives transport. The lack of large conformational changes within these domains suggests that the interdomain-linkers act as flexible tethers. Here, we show that interdomain-linkers are not mere tethers, but have a key regulatory role in dictating the conformational space of the transporter and defining the rotation axis of the mobile transport domain. By resolving a wide inward-open conformation of the SLC23 elevator transporter UraA and combining biochemical studies using a synthetic nanobody as conformational probe with hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that interdomain-linkers control the function of transport proteins by influencing substrate affinity and transport rate. These findings open the possibility to allosterically modulate the activity of elevator proteins by targeting their linkers.

 Aging is characterized by chronic systemic inflammation and metabolic changes. We compare the metabolic status of B cells from young and elderly donors and found that aging is associated with higher oxygen consumption rates, and especially higher extracellular acidification rates, measures of oxidative phosphorylation and of anaerobic glycolysis, respectively. Importantly, this higher metabolic status, which reflects age-associated expansion of pro-inflammatory B cells, is found associated with higher secretion of lactate and autoimmune antibodies after in vitro stimulation. B cells from elderly individuals induce in vitro polarization of CD4+ T cells from young individuals into pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells through metabolic pathways mediated by lactate, which can be inhibited by targeting lactate enzymes and transporters, as well as signaling pathways supporting anaerobic glycolysis. Lactate also induces immunosenescent B cells that are glycolytic, express transcripts for multiple pro-inflammatory molecules, and are characterized by a higher metabolic status. These results altogether may have relevant clinical implications and suggest alternative targets for therapeutic interventions in the elderly and patients with inflammatory conditions and diseases.

Here, the authors present a dynamic characterization of mGlu5, an obligate dimeric class C GPCR, suggesting an asymmetric, stepwise allosteric activation mechanism. 
 Two-thirds of signaling hormones and one-third of approved drugs exert their effects by binding and modulating the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activation. While the activation mechanism for monomeric GPCRs has been well-established, little is known about GPCRs in dimeric form. Here, by combining transition pathway generation, extensive atomistic simulation-based Markov state models, and experimental signaling assays, we reveal an asymmetric, stepwise millisecond allosteric activation mechanism for the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 receptor (mGlu5), an obligate dimeric class C GPCR. The dynamic picture is presented that agonist binding induces dimeric ectodomains compaction, amplified by the precise association of the cysteine-rich domains, ultimately loosely bringing the intracellular 7-transmembrane (7TM) domains into proximity and establishing an asymmetric TM6-TM6 interface. The active inter-domain interface enhances their intra-domain flexibility, triggering the activation of micro-switches crucial for downstream signal transduction. Furthermore, we show that the positive allosteric modulator stabilizes both the active inter-domain 7TM interface and an open, extended intra-domain ICL2 conformation. This stabilization leads to the formation of a pseudo-cavity composed of the ICL2, ICL3, TM3, and C-terminus, which facilitates G protein coordination. Our strategy may be generalizable for characterizing millisecond events in other allosteric systems. Activation mechanism of GPCRs in dimeric form remains enigmatic.

 Day-Night imaging technology that obtains full-color and infrared images has great market demands for security monitoring and autonomous driving. The current mainstream solution relies on wide-spectrum silicon photodetectors combined with Infrared Cutfilter Removal, which increases complexity and failure rate. Here, we address these challenges by employing a perovskite photodetector based on Pb−Sn alloyed single crystal with a vertical bandgap-graded structure that presents variable-spectrum responses at different biases and extends the infrared detection range close to 1100 nm. Taking advantage of the Pb−Sn gradients in mobility and built-in field, the perovskite photodetector shows a large linear dynamic range of 177 dB. In addition, the optoelectronic characteristics feature long-term operational stability over a year. We further develop an imaging module prototype without Infrared Cutfilter Removal that exhibits excellent color fidelity with RGB color differences ranging from 0.48 to 2.46 under infrared interference and provides over 26-bit grayscale resolution in infrared imaging.

In the United States, 16% of its electricity sector’s carbon budget could be spent within ten years due solely to the stranded asset effect. 
 Will power plants emit less or more CO2 in anticipation of stronger climate policies that would strand fossil fuel reserves? Here, using a worldwide data source on individual power plants’ CO2 emissions and the value of countries’ at-risk fossil fuel assets, we show that between 2009 and 2018, plants emitted more CO2 in countries where more assets would be devalued under a 1.5 °C scenario, which we theorize is due to these countries’ regulatory leniency and plants’ vested interest in long-term fossil fuel contracts. Although the extra amount of carbon emitted each year trigged by imperiled assets is relatively small, it would exhaust a sizable portion of the electricity sector’s remaining carbon budget when added up over time. This is especially true in the U.S. and Russia where up to 16% and 12% of their budgets, respectively, could be spent within ten years due solely to the stranded asset effect.

The carriers are shown to have the Long QT Syndrome phenotype with incomplete penetrance. 
 Rare genetic diseases are typically studied in referral populations, resulting in underdiagnosis and biased assessment of penetrance and phenotype. To address this, we develop a generalizable method of genotype inference based on distant relatedness and deploy this to identify undiagnosed Type 5 Long QT Syndrome (LQT5) rare variant carriers in a non-referral population. We identify 9 LQT5 families referred to a single specialty clinic, each carrying p.Asp76Asn, the most common LQT5 variant. We uncover recent common ancestry and a single shared haplotype among probands. Application to a non-referral population of 69,819 BioVU biobank subjects identifies 22 additional subjects sharing this haplotype, which we confirm to carry p.Asp76Asn. Referral and non-referral carriers have prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) compared to controls, and, among carriers, the QTc polygenic score is independently associated with QTc prolongation. Thus, our innovative analysis of shared chromosomal segments identifies undiagnosed cases of genetic disease and refines the understanding of LQT5 penetrance and phenotype.

Here, the authors reveal the landscapes of the activation process of OSCA/TMEM63 channels. 
 OSCA/TMEM63 channels, which have transporter-like architectures, are bona fide mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels that sense high-threshold mechanical forces in eukaryotic cells. The activation mechanism of these transporter-like channels is not fully understood. Here we report cryo-EM structures of a dimeric OSCA/TMEM63 pore mutant OSCA1.1-F516A with a sequentially extracellular dilated pore in a detergent environment. These structures suggest that the extracellular pore sequential dilation resembles a flower blooming and couples to a sequential contraction of each monomer subunit towards the dimer interface and subsequent extrusion of the dimer interface lipids. Interestingly, while OSCA1.1-F516A remains non-conducting in the native lipid environment, it can be directly activated by lyso-phosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PC) with reduced single-channel conductance. Structural analysis of OSCA1.1-F516A in lyso-PC-free and lyso-PC-containing lipid nanodiscs indicates that lyso-PC induces intracellular pore dilation by attracting the M6b to upward movement away from the intracellular side thus extending the intracellular pore. Further functional studies indicate that full activation of MS OSCA/TMEM63 dimeric channels by high-threshold mechanical force also involves the opening of both intercellular and extracellular pores. Our results provide the fundamental activation paradigm of the unique transporter-like MS OSCA/TMEM63 channels, which is likely applicable to functional branches of the TMEM63/TMEM16/TMC superfamilies. How mechanosensitive OSCA/TMEM63 channels are activated remains a mystery. Here, the authors reveal the landscapes of the activation process of OSCA/TMEM63 channels."

Here the authors predict how current forestry land is likely to face increased competition from agriculture as climate change shifts land-use suitability. 
 Timber and agricultural production must both increase throughout this century to meet rising demand. Understanding how climate-induced shifts in agricultural suitability will trigger competition with timber for productive land is crucial. Here, we combine predictions of agricultural suitability under different climate change scenarios (representative concentration pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) with timber-production maps to show that 240–320 Mha (20–26%) of current forestry land will become more suitable for agriculture by 2100. Forestry land contributes 21–27% of new agricultural productivity frontiers (67–105 Mha) despite only occupying 10% of the surface of the land. Agricultural frontiers in forestry land occur disproportionately in key timber-producing nations (Russia, the USA, Canada and China) and are closer to population centres and existing cropland than frontiers outside forestry land. To minimize crop expansion into forestry land and prevent shifting timber harvests into old-growth tropical and boreal forests to meet timber demand, emissions must be reduced, agricultural efficiency improved and sustainable intensification invested in. Increases in crop and timber production are necessary to meet rising needs. Here the authors predict how current forestry land is likely to face increased competition from agriculture as climate change shifts land-use suitability."

 As climate change accelerates, nations are moving towards meeting their nationally determined contributions and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reporting of this from the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector relies on data related to land use and management, climate and soil type. Where such data are unavailable, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a set of default factors, based on an extensive literature review of likely GHG emission factors and carbon stock changes disaggregated by the Food and Agriculture Organization’s global ecological zones. As understanding of global ecological zones under environmental change improves, it becomes necessary to reassess such ecological zoning approaches to enable reporting of GHG emissions to support nationally determined contributions and global change studies. Here we propose a globally consistent ecological zoning approach based on Holdridge life zones using climatic data from the Climate Research Unit on a 0.5° grid, which tackles certain limitations found in the existing guidance provided by the IPCC. A set of three global ecological zone maps based on Holdridge life zones were devised using increasing levels of aggregation, which could support sustainability studies of global environmental change, specifically climate change, and be used as a zoning approach by the IPCC.

 The growing global capacity for renewable energy generation necessitates the deployment of energy storage technologies with a combination of low cost, good performance and scalability. With these advantages, aqueous organic flow batteries have the potential to be the system of choice because they could store energy from organic redox-active molecules. Here we report naphthalene derivatives as organic redox-active molecules that exhibit high solubility (~1.5 M) and a stable redox-active framework with no obvious capacity decay over 40 days (50 Ah l−1) in an air atmosphere in flow batteries. We report a battery that runs smoothly even under continuous airflow without obvious capacity decay for ~22 days (more than 600 cycles). A series of spectral analyses and theoretical calculations reveal that the dimethylamine scaffolds improve the water solubility and protect the active centre, ensuring the stability of the molecules during the charge and discharge process. Owing to the success in kilogramme-scale molecular synthesis, pilot-scale stack expansion with notable cycling stability over 270 cycles (~27 days) is attained. The cost benefit evidenced by technoeconomic analysis together with the stability even under open-air conditions indicates the practical value of the present molecular system in grid-scale energy storage.

 Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction has great potential for simultaneously achieving ammonia recovery and nitrate-rich wastewater treatment. However, the complexity of wastewater matrices has long hampered its implementation and commercialization in the wastewater treatment industry. Here we develop a membrane-free electrochemical system, called electrochemical NO3− conversion synchronized with NH3 recovery (ECSN), which synchronizes nitrate reduction with ammonia recovery for treating real nitrate-rich wastewater. Key components of this system include a 3D-printed metallic glass decorated Cu–Ni (MPCN) working electrode bearing good corrosion resistance and a UV-assisted stripping unit. When treating real electroplating wastewater, the ECSN system converts over 70% of nitrate into high-purity ammonia chloride. Long-term stability test demonstrates the robustness of the ECSN system in treating real wastewater. Further, the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of this system are evidenced by technoeconomic analysis and life-cycle analysis. Overall, this work brings the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction process one step closer to practical application, contributing to both environmental protection and the circularity of anthropogenic nitrogen flow.

This study evaluates the impact of pesticide use on wild bee populations across the contiguous United States. 
 The decline of many wild bee species has major consequences for pollination in natural and agro-ecosystems. One hypothesized cause of the declines is pesticide use; neonicotinoids and pyrethroids in particular have been shown to have pernicious effects in laboratory and field experiments, and have been linked to population declines in a few focal species. We used aggregated museum records, ecological surveys and community science data from across the contiguous United States, including 178,589 unique observations from 1,081 bee species (33% of species with records in the United States) across six families, to model species occupancy from 1995 to 2015 with linked land use data. While there are numerous causes of bee declines, we discovered that the negative effects of pesticides are widespread; the increase in neonicotinoid and pyrethroid use is a major driver of changes in occupancy across hundreds of wild bee species. In some groups, high pesticide use contributes to a 43.3% decrease in the probability that a species occurs at a site. These results suggest that mechanisms that reduce pesticide use (such as integrative pest management) can potentially facilitate pollination conservation. Bees provide important pollination ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, but the extent to which they are affected by pesticide use on a continental scale has yet to be explored.

 Wastewater treatment is a major source of anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the current emission estimations rely on a uniform emission factor (EF) proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change based on a limited database suffering from large uncertainties and inaccuracies. To address this limitation, this study expands the database 12-fold and develops a tier-based approach. Our method considers emission variations across spatial scales, treatment processes and monitoring techniques, enabling more-precise estimations. Here, applying this approach to the US database, we highlight the limitations of current estimations based on uniform EFs and quantified the mean wastewater N2O emission in the United States to be 11.6 MMT CO2-eq. The results also reveal the diverse nature of wastewater N2O emissions and underscore the need for a customized approach to inform facility-level N2O emission estimation as well as inform national- and sector-wide greenhouse gases inventories with emphasis on site-specific considerations.

This study assessed the impact of such global change drivers on tree species distributions across Southeast Asian forests. 
 The forests of Southeast Asia harbour high levels of species diversity, providing a plethora of ecosystem services. However, this biodiversity is threatened by both climate and land-use change, the impacts of which are poorly understood. We modelled 1,498 tree species distributions under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) with varying global change intensities, and classified species into 11 spatially associated groups. We found both global changes to cause severe losses in tree distributions. Only under SSP1–2.6, the sustainable pathway with low intensities in both global changes, were distribution losses mitigated. Unexpectedly, losses were overall greatest under intermediate climate change pathways SSP2–4.5 and SSP3–7.0 rather than under the most extreme pathway, SSP5–8.5. This was because, although climate-driven losses were greatest under SSP5–8.5, land-use-driven losses were much more extensive under SSP2–4.5 and SSP3–7.0 than under SSP5–8.5. Crucially, other than SSP1–2.6, each SSP led to worst-case scenarios for several species groups. Our findings highlight that to most effectively conserve Southeast Asian tree distributions, policymakers need to prioritize a sustainable pathway that mitigates both global changes.

We also highlight key pathways through which these fluctuations affect methane production and emission, such as soil redox heterogeneity, changes in substrate availability and alternative electron acceptor pool, the contribution of different methane transport pathways, and the non-linear responses of community structure and activity of methanogens and methanotrophs to hydrological fluctuations.

 Eocene hyperthermal events reflect profound perturbations of the global carbon cycle. Most of our knowledge about their onset, timing, and rates originates from marine records. Hence, the pacing and magnitude of hyperthermal continental warming remains largely unaccounted for due to a lack of high-resolution climate records. Here we use terrestrial biomarkers and carbon isotopes retrieved from varved lake deposits of the UNESCO World Heritage site ‘Messel Fossil Pit’ (Germany) to quantify sub-millennial to millennial-scale temperature and carbon isotope changes across hyperthermal event C21n-H1 (47.2 million years ago). Our results show maximum warming of ca. 3.5 °C during C21n-H1. We propose that two components are responsible for the warming pattern across the hyperthermal: (1) the massive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere-ocean system and (2) half-precession orbital forcing indicated by ~12.000-year temperature cycles. The carbon isotope record of bulk organic matter indicates a sharp, 7‰ decrease at the peak of the hyperthermal, corresponding to increased organic carbon content and a shift in the lake algal community. Collectively, our proxy data reveal the structure of continental temperature response during the hyperthermal event that is characterized by overall warming with a superimposed pattern of sub-orbital scale temperature fluctuations.

 Shifts in the magnesium to calcium ratio of seawater in the geological history are thought to have profoundly affected biomineralization of marine invertebrates, including some echinoderms, which changed their skeletal mineralogy from high-magnesium to low-magnesium calcite and vice versa. Here we report on experiments that aimed to investigate the effect of ambient seawater magnesium to calcium ratio on magnesium to calcium ratio and nanomechanical properties in the spines of two echinoid species (Arbacia lixula and Paracentrotus lividus). We found that echinoids cultured in seawater with a low magnesium to calcium ratio produced a skeleton with lower both magnesium content and nanohardness than those of the control specimens incubated under normal (high) magnesium to calcium ratio conditions. These results may suggest that at certain times in the geological past (during the so-called calcite seas) sea urchins with decreased skeletal magnesium contents were more susceptible to damage due to physical disturbances, predation and post-mortem taphonomic processes. Increased skeletal hardness of echinoids from the so-called aragonite seas is expected to enhance their taphonomic potential, thus, to some extent, mitigates the preservation bias related to increased solubility of high-magnesium calcite. Oceanic chemistry changes have made echinoderm skeletons weaker, making them more prone to damage from physical disturbances, predatory attacks, and taphonomic processes, according to experimental, geochemical, and nanoindentation analyses."

 Earth’s mantle isotopic composition is highly heterogeneous, with enriched and depleted regions1–3 shaped by a complex history of depletion and re-enrichment over 4.5 billion years. The spatial configuration of large-scale heterogeneity in the mantle is not random4,5, but the timing and mechanisms that caused such heterogeneity are still debated2,6,7. We compiled radiogenic isotope data of mid-ocean ridge and plume-induced basalts from both present-day and past oceans for the past 900 million years of the relatively isotopically enriched African mantle domain. Our analysis shows that oceanic rocks of the African mantle domain exhibit a relatively homogenous composition similar to the prevalent mantle estimates (PREMA8) until ca. 350 million years ago when plume-derived rocks started becoming isotopically enriched with maximum enrichment reached in the mid-Cretaceous. From that point in time, plume-derived rocks shift toward depletion, getting closer to the prevalent mantle value. The enrichment trend is interpreted to have resulted from the recycling of crustal material during the assembly and the early stage of a break-up of Gondwana and Pangea, whereas the subsequent depletion trend is due to the outward retreat of the subduction girdle during the break-up of Pangea, thus both are legacies of geodynamic processes related to the supercontinent cycle.

 Organic food systems are recognised as an important component in meeting United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. A leverage points perspective can help to identify approaches which have the potential to facilitate transformative systemic change towards organic and sustainable farming. Using fuzzy cognitive maps developed from expert stakeholder opinions, we modelled a system of drivers of organic food production and consumption in the United Kingdom, according to the UN Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems framework. The most influential concepts in the uptake of organic systems were related to system norms and values and social structures, such as short-term economic thinking, landowner engagement, and relationships with certification bodies. However, in a scenario analysis, organic stakeholders identified relatively shallower leverage points as more likely to change under a sustainable future, resulting in limited systemic change. This demonstrates the need for policies targeting system norms, values and social structures relating to food systems to facilitate the transition to organic and sustainable farming.

 Accurate spatio-temporal information on rice cropping patterns is vital for predicting grain production, managing water resource and assessing greenhouse gas emissions. However, current automated mapping of rice cropping patterns at regional scale is heavily constrained by insufficient training samples and frequent cloudy weathers in major rice-producing areas. To tackle this challenge, we proposed a Phenology domain Optical-SAR feature inTegration method to Automatically generate single (SC-Rice) and double cropping Rice (DC-Rice) sample (POSTAR) for efficient and refined rice mapping. POSTAR includes three major steps: (1) generating a potential rice map using a phenology- and object-based classification method with optical data (Sentinel-2 MSI) to select candidate rice samples; (2) employing K-means to identify SC- and DC-Rice candidate samples according to unique SAR-based (Sentinel-1 SAR) phenological features; (3) implementing a two-step refinement strategy to filter high-confidence SC- and DC-Rice samples, maintaining a balance between intraclass phenological variance and sample purity. Test areas selected for validation include the Dongting Lake plain and Poyang Lake plain in South China, as well as Fujin county located in the Sanjiang plain of North China. POSTAR proved effective in producing reliable SC- and DC-Rice samples, achieving a high spectral correlation similarity (>0.85) and low dynamic time wrapping distance (<8.5) with field samples. Applying POSTAR-derived samples to random forest classifier yielded an overall accuracy of 89.6%, with F1 score of 0.899 for SC-Rice and 0.938 for DC-Rice in the Dongting Lake plain. Owing to the incorporation of knowledge-based optical and SAR phenological features, POSTAR exhibited strong spatial transferability, achieving an overall accuracy of 96.0% in the Poyang Lake plain and 97.8% in the Fujin county. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the POSTAR method in accurately mapping rice cropping patterns without extensive field visits, providing valuable insights for crop monitoring in large, diverse, and cloudy regions through the integration of optical and SAR data."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a unique remote sensing instrument imaging ocean surface waves in two dimensions with high spatial resolution regardless of sunlight and weather conditions. However, due to the nonlinear imaging process, the ocean wave spectra cannot be retrieved directly from SAR data. The emergence of deep learning (DL) techniques provides a new paradigm for addressing this challenge. In this paper, a deep-learning-based model, called Wave-Spec-CNN, is proposed for retrieving omni-directional ocean wave spectra from SAR data. This model is constructed using approximately 21,000 collocations of Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide swath mode images matched with global in-situ buoy data. The model adapts the convolution neural network (CNN) to accommodate the multi-valued nature of omni-directional ocean wave spectra, enhances performance by integrating a calibration branch and further incorporates physical characteristics into the training process. The results demonstrate consistency with buoy measurements for significant wave height (SWH) in the range of 0.5 m to 6 m, yielding a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.51 m on the validation dataset, comparable to traditional physical-based methods. In terms of mean wave period (MWP) and peak frequency (PF), the achieved RMSEs are of 1.24 s and 0.03 Hz, respectively. The retrieved omni-directional ocean wave spectra also allow to separate swell and windsea components for respective comparisons with those derived by in-situ buoy data. The RMSEs of respective SWH comparisons are of 0.46 m and 0.42 m. This research represents an initial endeavor into utilizing DL for the long-standing challenge of SAR inversion for ocean wave spectra, as well as providing valuable insights for employing DL in multi-parameter inversion tasks in remote sensing."

 This study focuses on advancing individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation in lidar data, developing a sensor- and platform-agnostic deep learning model transferable across a spectrum of dense laser scanning datasets from drone (ULS), to terrestrial (TLS), and mobile (MLS) laser scanning data. In a field where transferability across different data characteristics has been a longstanding challenge, this research marks a step towards versatile, efficient, and comprehensive 3D forest scene analysis.Central to this study is model performance evaluation based on platform type (ULS vs. MLS) and data density. This involved five distinct scenarios, each integrating different combinations of input training data, including ULS, MLS, and their augmented versions through random subsampling, to assess the model's transferability to varying resolutions and efficacy across different canopy layers. The core of the model, inspired by the PointGroup architecture, is a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with dedicated prediction heads for semantic and instance segmentation. The model underwent comprehensive validation on publicly available, machine learning-ready point cloud datasets. Additional analyses assessed model adaptability to different resolutions and performance across canopy layers.Our results reveal that point cloud random subsampling is an effective augmentation strategy and improves model performance and transferability. The model trained using the most aggressive augmentation, including point clouds as sparse as 10 points m−2, showed best performance and was found to be transferable to sparse lidar data and boosts detection and segmentation of codominant and dominated trees. Notably, the model showed consistent performance for point clouds with densities >50 points m−2 but exhibited a drop in performance at the sparsest level (10 points m−2), mainly due to increased omission rates. Benchmarking against current state-of-the-art methods revealed boosts of up to 20% in the detection rates, indicating the model's superior performance on multiple open benchmark datasets. Further, our experiments also set new performance baselines for the other public datasets. The comparison highlights the model's superior segmentation skill, mainly due to better detection and segmentation of understory trees below the canopy, with reduced computational demands compared to other recent methods.In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that it is indeed feasible to train a sensor-agnostic model that can handle diverse laser scanning data, going beyond current sensor-specific methodologies. Further, our study sets a new baseline for tree segmentation, especially in complex forest structures. By advancing the state-of-the-art in forest lidar analysis, our work also lays the foundation for future innovations in ecological modeling and forest management."

 Information on tree species across various spatial scales, from an individual tree to a forest stand and the broader landscape, contributes to an accurate and thorough understanding of forest conditions either as an individual characteristic or as an input of species-dependent models. However, tree species recognition is one of the most challenging tasks in forest remote sensing studies, due to the complexity of species compositions and canopy structures of forests, e.g., both cross-species similarities and intra-species variations commonly exist in spectral-, texture-, and structure- domains. Over the past two decades, the interest in using close-range sensing for tree species recognition has been rapidly growing. Recent research has highlighted the needs to further develop species recognition methods to elevate their performance in comparison with established remote sensing approaches, and to address new questions arising from spatial resolutions, data coverages, viewing geometries, and other data characteristics. This work provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of tree species recognition from close-range sensing data. The work summarizes the research works in the past decade, reviews the state of research, discusses prominent challenges, investigates impact factors, research gaps, and new potentials. Specifically, data from various sources, the features derived from each type of data, methodologies applied, and the targeted species are reviewed in detail. Relevant machine learning (ML) approaches are grouped into conventional ML and deep-learning (DL) categories. In each category, the reported studies/results are reviewed with respect to the spectral, spatial, and temporal domains of the used data sources, e.g., sensor and platform. Despite significant efforts in the field, the issues of automation, reliability, and robustness of the algorithms have only been partially resolved. The crucial elements in algorithm design what this work found and is worth careful consideration include forest types and stand conditions, seasonal variability and phenology, data characteristics and the corresponding feature selections, and the methodology. Future studies are recommended to focus on the fusion of multi-source data including passive and active multispectral data to integrate the spectral and structural information, the use of time-series data to enhance the role of phenological variances in species recognition, and the development of unsupervised DL techniques to improve the recognition accuracy and efficiency. It is also crucial to promote data sharing and open standards to facilitate international cooperation and communication."

 Terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) data are of great importance for hydrological research and water resource management. However, products derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and its Follow-On mission (GRACE-FO) are constrained by the satellite design and variation in processing strategies among different institutions, resulting in multiple suboptimal products. These products not only have a coarse spatial resolution but also suffer from a continuous 11-month gap from July 2017 to May 2018, which represent significant limitations for related research. To address these challenges, the Bayesian-based three-cornered hat (BTCH) method was initially employed to fuse low-uncertainty GRACE-derived TWSA and GWSA products with a coarse resolution (0.5°). Subsequently, based on the fused TWSA/GWSA products and multi-source datasets, a machine learning downscaling framework based on a physically constrained sliding window (MLDF-PCSW) was developed. This framework not only enhanced the spatial resolution of the products but also filled the data gap, ultimately producing a high-resolution water storage anomaly product (HWSA v1.0), a long-term, continuous dataset on a global scale (excluding Greenland and Antarctica; variables: TWSA and GWSA; spatial resolution: 0.05°; temporal resolution: monthly; period: April 2002 to December 2022). The results of uncertainty analysis using the three-cornered hat (TCH) method indicated that the TWSA derived from the Center for Space Research (CSR) exhibited the lowest uncertainty (23.91 mm) of the three original products, and the uncertainty decreased by 35.42% (15.44 mm) after data fusion using the BTCH method. The HWSA v1.0 dataset based on MLDF-PCSW exhibited high correlation coefficients (CCs) (0.999 and 0.999 for TWSA and GWSA, respectively) and a low root mean square error (RMSE) (0.68 mm and 1.24 mm for TWSA and GWSA, respectively) with the original TWSA and GWSA products, while also providing more detailed TWSA and GWSA spatial information. Independent validation for TWSA_DYY based on the water balance method has been done across six basins and the results are great, with the CCs between 0.69 and 0.92. The GWSA from the MLDF-PCSW demonstrated acceptable correspondence with global in-situ groundwater observations, with a mean CC of 0.27. The other four previously released gap-filled TWSA products also exhibited outstanding performance, with the average CC reaching 0.98 for the 11-month gap. Collectively, these results suggest that the HWSA v1.0 dataset based on the MLDF-PCSW has significant potential as a robust data foundation for related research."

 As one of the most important staple foods globally, rice sustains nearly half of the world's population. Accurate and timely paddy rice mapping is, thus, essential for rice-related policy-making to ensure food security in the context of anthropogenic, environmental and climate changes. However, paddy rice mapping remains a challenging task since it usually has similar spectral characteristics to other land covers. In this research, for the first time, an entirely new approach, called RiceTColour, was proposed for mapping rice fields within the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) colour space based on their unique spectra during the rice transplanting period as observed in remotely sensed imagery. We demonstrate that transplanted rice fields, representing a mixture of soil, water and rice seedlings, consistently exhibit relatively low spectral values in both SWIR and NIR bands across various geographical locations, leading to their unique dark green colours in the false-colour image composed of SWIR, NIR and Red bands. Based upon this, we transformed these three spectral bands into the CIE colour space where paddy rice was found to be readily and completely separated from the other land covers. Straightforward, but specific classification criteria were established within the CIE colour space to differentiate paddy rice from the other land covers. The proposed RiceTColour, thus, represents a new approach for paddy rice identification, that is mapping paddy rice using the CIE colour space based upon the previous underexplored remotely sensed spectra of paddy fields during the transplanting season. The effectiveness of the proposed method was investigated over five rice-planting regions distributed across different geographical regions, characterised by different climates, rice cropping intensities, irrigation schemes and cultural practices. Specifically, the mapping criteria established in a training site (S1) were directly generalised to the other four sites (S2 to S5) for paddy rice mapping. Experimental results demonstrated that the RiceTColour method consistently achieved the most accurate and balanced classifications across all five sites compared with four benchmark comparators: a SAR-based method, an index-based method and two supervised classifier-based methods. In particular, the RiceTColour method performed relatively stable, producing an overall accuracy exceeding 95% in the training site (S1) as well as the four generalised sites (S2 to S5), which is an encouraging result. Such efficient yet stable rice mapping results across various rice-planting regions suggest a very strong generalisation capability of the proposed RiceTColour method. In consideration of the relatively large planting area of paddy rice fields globally, the proposed parameter-free, efficient, and generalisable RiceTColour method, thus, holds great potential for widespread application in various rice-planting areas worldwide."

 Spaceborne lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provide a unique opportunity for global forest inventory by generating broad-scale measurements sensitive to the vertical arrangement of plant matter as a supplement to in situ measurements. Lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest, including biomass, and therefore must be related through statistical models. Further, GEDI observations are not spatially complete, necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averages/totals. Such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas, such as Indonesia, where the density of quality observations is diminished. We developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gap-free maps of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at various resolutions within the lowlands of Jambi province, Indonesia. A biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from GEDI waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. After selecting a locally suitable ground-finding algorithm setting, we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and GEDI-observed waveforms. Finally, a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the on-orbit GEDI observations. These three models were nested into a single hierarchical model, relating the spatial distribution of GEDI observations to field-measured AGBD. The model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship. The model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass, with a median relative standard deviation of 8% at the 1 km resolution and 26% at the 100 m resolution. The spatially consistent information on AGBD provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management, carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change. This is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like Jambi, Indonesia in order to understand the impacts of land-use transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber. More generally, we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions."

 Effective monitoring of soil and vegetation properties on a global scale is essential for better understanding climate changes, hydrological dynamics, and ecological processes. Passive microwave remote sensing at C-band radio frequency, with long observation period and relatively high penetration capability, has been widely used to retrieve soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (C-VOD). The retrieval process is generally achieved by inversion of the τ-ω radiative transfer model, which depends on crucial parameters such as effective scattering albedo (ω) and soil roughness (HR) for accurate retrievals. Current SM/C-VOD retrieval algorithms, such as the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM), predominantly rely on globally-constant ω and HR values, ignoring the inherent sensitivity of those parameters to varying soil conditions and vegetation types. To evaluate the impact of ω and HR variables on SM and C-VOD retrievals and to improve their accuracy, this study proposed and evaluated a novel retrieval approach from AMSR2 C-band observations during 2017–2020 using the C-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (C-MEB) model. We evaluated two new retrieval algorithms, considering either a globally-constant calibration or a land cover-based calibration of ω and HR. As a benchmark for the calibration, we optimized the values of ω and HR by evaluating the retrieved SM against in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and OzNet hydrological monitoring networks. The main originality compared to previous algorithms is that i) it includes a comprehensive calibration exploring the optimal values of ω and HR, applicable globally or tailored to specific land cover; ii) field SM measurements were leveraged to constrain the calibrated value of ω and HR.For the globally-constant calibration, the optimal values of ω = 0.05 and HR = 0.1 were found to yield the best results. For the land cover-based calibration, an inverse relationship between ω/HR and canopy height was observed, with ω ranging from 0.04 to 0.06 and HR ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 for heights between 0 and 30 m. The algorithm employing a land cover-based calibration (INRAE Bordeaux 2, IB2) exhibited better performance than the one utilizing a globally-constant calibration (INRAE Bordeaux 1, IB1) in evaluating retrieved SM against in situ measurements, as well as in evaluating C-VOD vs various vegetation variables including aboveground biomass (AGB), tree cover, canopy height and several optical vegetation indices. Comparison with LPRM suggested that our IB2 C-VOD retrievals present improved performances in terms of both spatial and temporal results with all considered vegetation variables (spatial correlation (R) between various vegetation variables and C-VOD of 0.76–0.83 for IB2 vs 0.69–0.79 for LPRM), and exhibited lower saturation effects when compared with AGB. In addition, the IB2 SM produced lower root mean squared error (RMSE) (0.147 vs 0.217 m3/m3), bias (−0.03 vs 0.09 m3/m3), and ubRMSE (0.066 vs 0.067 m3/m3) when compared with in situ measurements, although it showed a lower R compared to LPRM SM."

 A dataset of sub-daily C-band data, acquired with a ground-based synthetic aperture radar, has been used to study soil and vegetation dynamics during a complete growing season in a controlled agricultural test site. The data have been exploited to analyse the rate and sources of decorrelation in the scene, as well as the consequences of the observation conditions of a sub-daily satellite (with either low, medium or geosynchronous orbit): short revisit times, availability of multiple acquisitions during a single day, and shallow observations at some incidence angles. Repeat-pass coherence is found to be less affected by temporal decorrelation when the primary image is acquired during nighttime or the last hours predawn. Regarding the incidence angle, VV has increased sensitivity to certain phenological stages as the incidence angle increases. Additionally, a periodic oscillation on a sub-daily scale is observed when creating coherence time series with increasing temporal baseline. Factors which strongly contribute to these oscillations are the daily cycles of temperature, soil moisture and vegetation water dynamics."

 Accurate measurement of water levels is essential for effectively managing reservoirs to proactively mitigate flooding and drought. Nonetheless, the inaccuracies in measurements derived from gauging station and remote sensing images impose constraints to water resource management. In this study, we developed a novel water level estimation model which utilizes solely the altitude of reliable water boundary pixels to improve the accuracy. The enhanced water boundary detection, incorporating preprocessing steps such as image filtering, resampling, and polarization multiplication, was applied to achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting water boundaries. The water boundary pixels located in layover and shadow regions, which could be misidentified due to distortion error, are eliminated based on backward geolocation. Ambiguous water boundaries, potentially indicating land with low intensity, were defined by computing their absolute derivatives, and removed. Finally, to enhance water level precision, the model computed water levels by averaging the altitudes of boundary pixels with weighting factors of local incidence angle, derivatives of detected water boundaries, and altitude distribution. Compared with the previous studies utilizing water boundaries, the proposed model demonstrated outstanding performance in improving the accuracy, up to 1/40th smaller than the spatial resolution of SAR images in Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The validation was executed over the results from >700 Sentinel-1 against the in-situ measurements obtained from multiple reservoirs and streams with significant water level fluctuations in the Korean peninsula. In this process, we found that the water boundaries located on the layover and shadow regions significantly influence the dispersion of altitude of reliable water boundary pixels. This study demonstrates the proposed model relying on remote sensing data without in-situ measurements, which holds potential applicability under situations where in-situ data are unavailable."

 Mapping and monitoring groundwater-dependant vegetation (GDV) and springs is essential for understanding the dynamics of shallow groundwater systems and for developing ecosystem conservation strategies. While large-scale identification of GDV and springs often relies on mapping excess evaporation, it is low resolution, and it can be prone to false detections over some types of soils and in areas of runoff accumulation. Here a simple, more direct approach for large scale, high resolution GDV mapping is proposed, which is designed to be cost and time efficient. The approach is tested over three catchments of Northern Australia, totalling 290,000 km2. The approach relies on constraining the selection of optical and radar imagery products from Sentinel-1/2 with GRACE Terrestrial Water storage change time-series. GRACE identifies periods of water scarcity across the landscape, which corresponds to higher contrast between the healthy, green GDV and other vegetation populations suffering from droughts. Via an additive masking approach, several combinations of dry-condition vegetation indices are tested, and the effort/efficiency trade-off of using one or a combination of up to four vegetation indices is assessed. Combining InSAR coherence and NDVI is particularly efficient, allowing validation of 80% of datapoints within citizen science records by considering as little as 2.7% of the surface area. While the combination of InSAR coherence and NDWI can also be efficient in some cases, all fully optical or radar combinations of indices are significantly less performant. The different sensitivities of radar and optical sensors allows masking of false positives inherent to each sensing strategy. By combining citizen science, GRACE time-variable gravity data and optical/radar-derived vegetation indices, it is now possible to map GDV even where direct in situ observations are impossible."

 P-band (0.3–1 GHz) radiometry shows promise in enhancing the next generation of radiometer missions for global soil moisture and vegetation optical depth (VOD) monitoring, particularly in moderately to densely vegetated areas, which remain challenging for current L-band (1.4 GHz) missions such as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP). However, the superiority of P-band over L-band in this regard has not been experimentally verified, and the quantitative differences remain unexplored. To address this gap, the P-band Radiometer Inferred Soil Moisture (PRISM) tower-based experiment was conducted, pioneering a comprehensive evaluation of P- (0.75 GHz) and L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometry in densely vegetated areas with vegetation water content (VWC) up to 20 kg/m2. The results revealed that P-band VOD was consistently lower than L-band VOD, suggesting reduced vegetation attenuation and thus a higher VWC threshold for reliable soil moisture sensing at P-band. The VWC thresholds for P- and L-band were estimated at 7.7 kg/m2 and 4.0 kg/m2, respectively, suggesting that P-band radiation could go through the vegetation approximately twice as effectively as L-band radiation. Additionally, the Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI) was identified as a strong predictor of retrieval performance because it established a good link between retrieval errors and VWC. Regarding VOD retrieval, robust logarithmic relationships (R2 > 0.9) between VOD and VWC were established for both bands within the 0–20 kg/m2 VWC range, challenging the previously assumed linear relationship. Moreover, P-band demonstrated greater retrieval robustness as its dual-polarized TB observations contain more independent information than those of L-band. This research establishes the foundation for a successful passive microwave mission at P-band, aiming to improve the quality of global VOD and soil moisture datasets."

 Accurate estimation of sub-surface properties such as moisture content and depth of soil and vegetation layers is crucial for applications spanning sub-surface condition monitoring, precision agriculture, and effective wildfire risk assessment. Soil in nature is often covered by overlaying vegetation and surface organic material, making its characterization challenging. In addition, the estimation of the properties of the overlaying layer is crucial for applications like wildfire risk assessment. This study thus proposes a Bayesian model-updating-based approach for ground penetrating radar (GPR) waveform inversion to predict moisture contents and depths of soil and overlaying material layer. Due to its high correlation with moisture contents, the dielectric permittivity of both layers were predicted with the proposed method, along with other parameters, including depth and electrical conductivity of layers. The proposed Bayesian model updating approach yields probabilistic estimates of these parameters that can provide information about the confidence and uncertainty related to the estimates. The methodology was evaluated for a diverse range of experimental data collected through laboratory and field investigations. Laboratory investigations included variations in soil moisture values, depth of the overlaying surface layer, and coarseness of surface material. The field investigation included measurement of field soil moisture for sixteen days. The results demonstrated predictions consistent with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements and conventional gravimetric tests. The correlation coefficient between predicted soil permittivity and that measured by TDR ranged from 0.84 to 0.99 for the presence of up to 10 cm of overlaying surface layer. The depth of the surface layer could also be accurately predicted for up to 10 cm, while at higher depths, prediction outliers could be reasonably identified from the obtained probability distributions and uncertainty. Hence, the proposed method provides a promising approach for uncertainty-aware sub-surface parameter estimation that can enable decision-making for risk assessment across a wide range of applications."

 Rock glaciers, unique creeping periglacial landforms, have garnered research interest for their valuable insights into hydrological resources and representing potential geological hazards in the context of climate warming. However, owing to the scarcity of high-spatiotemporal-resolution kinematic observations, the mechanisms driving rock glacier movements remain poorly understood. This study introduces a strategy for estimating three-dimensional (3D) velocities of rock glaciers by combining ascending and descending interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations with a surface parallel flow model. We mapped the 3D surface creeping velocities of 1084 rock glaciers in Daxueshan, southwest Tibetan Plateau, from January 2019 to December 2020. Subsequently, we employed the generalized boosted model (GBM), a machine learning approach, to link rock glacier creep to environmental factors. The rock glaciers in Daxueshan exhibited spatially heterogeneous creep, with maximum and average annual velocities of 307.86 mm∙a−1 and 40.37 mm∙a−1, respectively. About 92% of rock glaciers crept with a two-peak seasonal rhythm characterized by “spring acceleration, summer deceleration, autumn acceleration, and winter deceleration”. GBM modeling suggested that precipitation and snowmelt were the predominant environmental factors controlling the kinematics of rock glaciers, with relative importance of 32.6% and 31.7%, respectively. Land surface temperature (LST) was the third significant driver at 17.1% of the relative importance. Slope angle and topographic wetness index (TWI) had the least impact. The modeling also quantitatively revealed the distinct nonlinear responses of rock glacier creep to environmental changes. Rock glaciers initiate acceleration at precipitation and snowmelt levels of about 2 mm, LST close to −2 °C, slope angle and TWI higher than 12° and 4.6, and stabilize when these factors reach certain thresholds. Furthermore, the seasonal variations in rock glacier creeping velocity can be primarily attributed to hydrological changes. Our study highlights the value of combining InSAR and machine learning to elucidate the environmental controls on mass-wasting phenomena in mountainous regions."

 Managing unregulated dumpsites in urban environments is a pressing issue, but determining their locations presents persistent challenges due to their irregular distribution. Recently, researchers have begun employing aerial view remote sensing imagery coupled with deep learning detection to identify open dumpsites. However, due to interference from scenes with similar visual features in the satellite imagery, the false alarm rate remains high. A model named CascadeDumpNet is proposed by this study, which integrates deep learning and automated machine learning for open dumpsite detection, effectively combining the visual characteristics of open dumpsites with the features of the surrounding environment to eliminate erroneous detection and improve detection precision. Notably, the model is equipped with a novel Contextual Feature Synthesis (CFS) module that was specifically designed to enhance object detection in bird-view remote sensing imagery. This module is adept at leveraging remote sensing contextual information, thereby significantly refining the detection process by considering the broader environmental features of dumpsites. The performance of the model was compared with six advanced object detection architectures to demonstrate its superiority. High-resolution multispectral satellite imagery from the Pléiades satellite, featuring a spatial resolution of 0.5 m, was utilized to analyze the dumpsite distribution in Shenzhen, China. The model was applied to this densely urbanized area, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting open dumpsites within such environments. Additionally, the transferability of the model was verified through successful applications in two other major Chinese cities, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Furthermore, the distribution pattern of dumpsites was analyzed, which revealed that the density of dumpsites is predominantly concentrated in highly urbanized areas, which are characterized by high population densities, and a strong correlation was observed between the locations of these dumpsites and proximities to forests, elevated highways, and industrial zones. Overall, the development of the CascadeDumpNet model provides new insights into urban waste management, offering a novel, efficient, and precise approach to the detection and analysis of open dumpsites."

 Geo-text data, which combine geographical locations with textual information (e.g., geo-tagged tweets), are typically visualized using tag maps. Since tags are rich in attribute information, tag maps are an intuitive method of visualizing how attribute domains carried by tags vary across space. However, users may be interested not only in the overall spatial distribution of tags but also in exploring detailed attributes-in-space analyses, such as examining how a subclass of attribute domains is distributed globally or checking whether all attribute subclasses exhibit the same global distribution pattern. To date, the methods for representing tags with visual encoding (e.g., size, color) to extend various attributes-in-space tasks to support exploratory analysis remain unclear. In this work, we extended tag maps to support exploratory analysis by distinguishing space searching into local or global spaces and attribute domains into within or between attribute classes, supporting four types of attributes-in-space tasks: global-within, local-within, global-between, and local-between tasks. We evaluated our exploratory tag map through two case studies: investigating major disaster occurrences from 1981 to 2020 and examining the leading causes of death in 2000 and 2019 for Spain, France, Germany and Italy. We used eye-tracking and a questionnaire to evaluate our exploratory tag map for comparison.

 The resolution of ambiguity (AR) is of paramount importance for the precise point positioning (PPP) technique, as it enables the reduction of convergence duration and the improvement of positioning accuracy. Uncalibrated phase delay (UPD) is a key factor in ambiguity fixation. We investigate the difference between different scale UPD estimates which are obtained from MGEX and YNCORS stations in PPP-AR performance during quiet and geomagnetic storm periods.

 In this study, hyperspectral data of two geographically distant study areas in Germany were analyzed to find the most effective spectral wavelengths for red-edge-based vegetation indices to differentiate bark beetle-infested Norway spruce into three infestation classes, including green-attack. Considering that the relationship between red-edge position (REP) and reflection shoulder position (RESP) is crucial for the relative quantification of chlorophyll concentration and LAI and their changes due to bark beetle infestation, we tested normalized difference red-edge indices (NDRE) formed from these parameters. Using combinations of 75 spectral bands in the range 685 nm to 850 nm, we analyzed 1187 different NDREs, and two additional vegetation indices, and show that the sorted, normalized Kruskal-Wallis H-value, followed by a frequency analysis of the RESP and REP bands of the 10 % of the highest ranked NDREs is an effective way to identify the global optima of these parameters. The optimal REP and RESP estimated using this approach were determined at 714 nm and 758 nm, respectively. The derived normalized difference red-edge index NDRE758_714 could be successfully applied to both test sites. Moreover, we found that aggregating hyperspectral bands into broader bands – 703 nm to 729 nm for a REP band and 741 nm to 767 nm for a RESP band – did not degrade model accuracy when used in a multispectral NDRE, suggesting that a hyperspectral camera is not required to perform the task.

The predictive accuracies of the models for the test data indicated MNLR to be more robust than the RF.

To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we introduce, for the first time, an alternative training approach for SAR 3D point cloud segmentation using LiDAR annotated data, which offers a more abundant sample pool, thus alleviating the lack of training sets. Nevertheless, a segmentation model trained on LiDAR point clouds exhibits a significant decline in performance when directly applied to SAR 3D reconstructed point clouds due to the cross-domain discrepancy. This research presents a pioneering domain adaptation 3D semantic segmentation framework to implement cross-modal learning for SAR point clouds. In our scheme, a simple yet effective technique is developed to achieve segmentation of SAR double-bounce scattering regions called SARDBS-Mix, which employs a mixing strategy, to capture the distinctive reflection characteristics of SAR data. Furthermore, we implement approaches including center alignment and normalization, local augmentation, and weighted cross entropy to mitigate LiDAR and SAR domain gap and class imbalances. The experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for SAR 3D reconstructed point cloud segmentation."

 Amid the escalating conflicts between urban demography, resource availability, and environmental constraints, there is an accelerating demand for emergency medical services prompted by a spectrum of factors including diseases, natural calamities, and unforeseen events. This growth is further accentuated by an imbalance in the allocation of emergency facilities, amplifying public anxiety and underscoring the urgent necessity for scientifically informed optimization of pre-hospital emergency facilities. To this end, the present study articulates specific optimization goals for facility deployment and introduces a nuanced set coverage optimization model that integrates spatiotemporal determinants of emergency service requirements. The model is fortified with a constellation of constraints, including spatial constraint, temporal constraint, and coverage constraint. For spatial constraints, we use the Monte Carlo simulation to predict the spatial distribution of emergency demands. Temporal constraints involve determining the actual travel time matrix from predicted demand points to candidate sites. Coverage constraints specify the effective demand coverage rate. This study uses Nanjing as a case example, utilizing multisource big data, including ambulance GPS logs from June 2016 to May 2017, Amap traffic congestion indicators, and survey data on existing emergency facilities in Nanjing City. By preprocessing and analyzing the existing data, this study thoroughly investigates the spatiotemporal distribution of emergency demands and the impact of traffic congestion on emergency service effectiveness. Consequently, the model incorporates constraints that ensure, under the specified planning and actual traffic conditions, 95 % of the simulated emergency demands can be met within an 8-minute on-route time. Locations for pre-hospital emergency stations are optimized using a genetic algorithm, achieving the best solution at the 120th iteration. Verification confirms 134 optimal sites; after excluding 52 existing sites, 82 potential sites are identified. The new layout plan has reduced Nanjing’s average emergency response time from 18.6 min to 12 min. Additionally, under peak and average traffic conditions, emergency demand coverage rates improved from 76.92 % and 83.18 % at 15 min to 95.61 % and 98.10 % at 12 min, respectively. These results demonstrate that the new layout significantly enhances practical application effectiveness. The approach presented in this paper addresses the previously overlooked randomness of emergency incidents and traffic conditions, offering innovative strategies for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency station planning and site selection models."

 The analysis of association rules within ecosystems is crucial for monitoring, managing, and conserving natural resources. As widely adopted approaches for this task, geospatial methods involving spatial co-location pattern mining can reveal distribution rules and inherent associations among diverse geographical elements. Rooted in Tobler’s first law of geography, these methods focus on the impact of spatial proximity. However, apart from proximity, heterogeneity of environmental attributes such as elevation, temperature and precipitation are also essential for the formation of associations. For environmental co-location (Eco-location) pattern detection, we propose a method based on the Geo-Eco Knowledge Graph (GEKG) to mine multi-impact association rules. Firstly, we introduce the Adaptive Threshold (AT) to constrain the Delaunay triangular network, dynamically regulating adjacency relationships to generate geo-eco knowledge graph’s skeleton. For comprehensive ecosystem representation, various environmental attributes are integrated as semantic information into GEKG. In the reasoning of Eco-location patterns, we innovate beyond the traditional co-location paradigm by considering both spatial proximity and semantic similarity. Under the impact of various environmental information, sub-sets of geographically proximate entities are extracted to detect Eco-location patterns. For effective management and efficient computation, we utilize the Neo4j graph database to manage large-scale GEKG and mine Eco-location patterns with its graph search function. Experiments conducted on simulated and real-world ecological datasets show that, compared to existing techniques, our GEKG-based method can detect Eco-location patterns with greater accuracy and efficiency."

 Land subsidence is recognized as one of the hazards that threaten Metro Manila, Philippines, and other major urban areas worldwide. It has become a significant global issue caused by excessive groundwater extraction, rapid urbanization, and natural sediment compaction, exacerbated by climate change through rising sea levels. This paper presents vertical ground motion rates in Philippine metropolitan cities using Sentinel-1 InSAR time series analysis from 2014 to 2020 through UK COMET’s LiCSAR products and the LiCSBAS package of Morishita et al. (2020). The results revealed a maximum subsidence rate of 109 mm/yr in Bulacan Province in Greater Manila. For the first time, this paper also presents ground motion estimates and the following maximum subsidence rates for other Philippine metropolitan cities: 11 mm/yr in Metro Cebu, 38 mm/yr in Metro Davao, 9 mm/yr in Metro Iloilo, and 29 mm/yr in Legazpi City. Areas with remarkably high subsidence rates are observed as circular to elliptical deformation features in vertical motion maps. Sinking areas mostly coincide with industrial and commercial complexes evident as a contiguous distribution of large and expansive man-made structures with distinct radar reflections. Monitoring this hazard is crucial as it increases the risk of floods, building and infrastructure damage, and economic loss, and exposes residents along the coast to worsening tidal incursions and storm surges due to climate change. InSAR is proposed here as a targeted, long-term deformation monitoring tool, especially related to groundwater usage."

 The automatic extraction of inspection points for pylons is essential for intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) power inspections, especially in generating inspection route. However, current researches primarily focus on power scene perception and power component fault detection, with little attention paid to the inspection point detection. The primary reason are the lack of public pylon datasets for keypoint detection and the neglect of distinguish the inspection points from the keypoints used in feature extraction. Regarding that, this paper proposes a two-stage unsupervised pylon keypoint detection (UPKD) method to improve the efficiency of power inspections. In the first stage, the UPKD Network processes the point cloud to generate candidate keypoints, which comprises two main components: a data normalization module and an unsupervised keypoint detection network (UKD-Net). The data normalization module compresses information based on the symmetric structure of pylons, thereby reducing instability in inspection point detection. The UKD-Net incorporates a Point Transformer layer that uses self-attention mechanisms to extract features from the point cloud. In the second stage, a convex optimization strategy is applied to filter and acquire inspection points. These inspection points are then interconnected using a shortest-path strategy to generate the UAV inspection route. Our dataset is obtained using the Riegl VUX-1 laser measurement system and comprises 3,296 pylons of 10 types. Each pylon’s point cloud contains up to 25,000 points, with a high point density of 100 pts/m2. Extensive experiments show that the UPKD Network achieved state-of-the-art performance on our dataset, with repeatability achieving 90.39%, effectiveness (the ratio of effective keypoints to annotation points) achieving 69.95%, and completeness (the ratio of detected annotation points to keypoints) achieving 79.55%."

 Building models are important for urban studies. Remote sensing multi-spectral (MS) images are widely used for its rich semantic information. The lack of geometry features is fulfilled by introducing photogrammetry derived digital surface models (DSMs), resulting in pairs of DSMs and MS images. Utilizing such pairs and a convolutional neural network, level of detail (LoD) 2.2 building models, which contain roof planes and major roof elements (e.g. dormers), are reconstructed in this work. Leveraging both raster and vector predictions, 3-D building models with straight edges and sharp corners are obtained. The proposed two-stage method first extracts vectorized roof lines from pairs of DSMs and RGB images, followed by generation of detailed 2-D and 3-D polygonal building models. We conducted our experiments based on two datasets: a custom dataset in Landsberg am Lech in Germany, and an open dataset named Roof3D.

 As an important part of the geological environment assessment in recent years, mine interpretation has attracted broad attention in the area of sustainable development. As an object that can be captured by remote sensing of multispectral imageries, the open-pit (OP) mine environment has the characteristics of irregular distribution, diverse shapes, and varied textures and colors, which makes interpretation a challenge and limits the accuracy of OP mine mapping. Moreover, the development of computational vision technology enables efficient and fast interpretation. However, there is a lack of open semantic segmentation datasets for OP mining areas. In this paper, we introduce a dataset for OP mining areas in the West Hubei metallogenic belt (DOWHM) for OP mine element interpretation. DOWHM includes 24 active OP mining zones in China’s Hubei Province, with a total of 1875 satellite images of 224×224 pixels at a resolution of 0.6 m. Second, we design a ConvFormer model for fine classification and mapping in OP mining areas. The ConvFormer model adopts an encoder featuring a large convolutional kernel. The decoder of the ConvFormer model employs a multi-branch approach, integrating modules of convolutional neural network (CNN) and self-attention mechanism. In this manner, ConvFormer effectively captures both global–local information. This solves the problem of the misclassification of elements in the prediction results, and especially has advantages in road classification. In the experiments, ConvFormer achieved mIoU of 68.18% on DOWHM. Compared to other popular semantic segmentation models, ConvFormer improved the overall mIoU by 2%, which is advantageous in the fine classification of OP mining regions, and it can be applied to the mapping of entire mining regions.

 Supervoxels provide a more natural and compact 3D point cloud representation, which is a fundamental problem in point cloud processing and has attracted extensive attention from many scholars. At present, although the supervoxel segmentation has achieved significant results, the processing efficiency still restricts its further processing in the face of large-scale point cloud processing. Therefore, this paper proposes a new supervoxel segmentation method for point clouds to achieve fast supervoxel over-segmentation of large-scale point clouds while maintaining good boundaries and accuracy. Firstly, the supervoxel segmentation is formulated as a subset selection problem. With the idea of greedy strategy, the interval quick sorting and region growing methods is designed to realize the rapid merging of subsets in the iterative process. Secondly, the Manhattan distance metric and the seed point median simulation method are proposed to enhance the precision of iterative optimization and improve the efficiency of point cloud supervoxel segmentation.

 Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) is pivotal for precise positioning and mapping. However, visual data from crowd-sourced datasets often contains deficiencies that may lead to positioning errors. Despite existing optimization techniques, current algorithms do not adequately adapt to varied data in vehicle driving scenarios. To address this gap, this study introduces a novel SLAM framework (SLG-SLAM). This framework refines trajectories by integrating semantic information, laser point cloud, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data into V-SLAM. Initial trajectory estimates are made after filtering out dynamic targets and are subsequently refined with matched laser point clouds, then corrected for scale and direction using GNSS. The efficacy of this approach is assessed using four public datasets and one self-collected dataset, showing significant enhancements across all datasets. The proposed method reduces the mean absolute trajectory error by 43.50% on the KITTI dataset and 14.91% on the MVE dataset compared to the baseline. Unlike the baseline, which fails on three other datasets, the proposed method successfully performs localization and mapping. Additionally, compared to three other single-source methods (DynaSLAM, MCL, MVSLAM), the proposed method consistently outperforms, demonstrating its superior adaptability and effectiveness."

 Modern forestry relies on an extensive network of well-maintained forest roads. However, the trafficability of forest roads can be limited by poor construction or by insufficient load-bearing capacity caused by, for example, weather conditions. In all forestry operations, the forest roads should be able to support heavy vehicles during the transport of roundwood and harvesting machinery, so logistics must be carefully planned to ensure good road trafficability. To facilitate this planning, it is necessary to know the various characteristics of the forest road in terms of its width, structure and load-bearing capacity. Obtaining such information using remote sensing data would be beneficial. In this study, we used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to assess the width of the roadway on forest roads. We developed several algorithms that were used to assess roadway width based on the cross-sectional data (derived with ALS) of the roads in 8-m long segments. The ALS echoes within the segments were classified into 20 cm wide strips which the algorithms then analyzed in a stepwise manner. Both height and intensity information from the ALS data were utilized. The algorithm results were then used as predictors in linear models to predict the roadway width. The main focus was on the road level, i.e., aggregated values from 25 different roads were used in model fitting. In terms of root mean square error (RMSE) values, accuracies of approximately 20–30 cm (or 7–10 %) were obtained for the predicted roadway widths with a separate validation data. This level of accuracy can be considered adequate given the characteristics of the ALS data used in the modelling. The results indicate that the presented approach has potential for practical applications to predict the width attributes of forest roads."

 Recent research has shown that deep learning (DL) faces physical realism challenges in predicting runoff responses under climate change, mainly due to DL’s data dependence and lack of process understanding. In this study, a physics-encoded neural network model (dNN) was developed to adress this. dNN enables a fully process-based way to training and prediction by encoding process-based modeling knowledge into the DL architecture, including the water balance principle and causal linkages of catchment hydrological processes. To examine whether dNN can produce reliable runoff responses under warming scenarios, we first conducted regional training for dNN on daily runoff in 29 catchment in California. Two process-based models, EXP-HYDRO and HBV, were then developed as benchmarks. Both dNN and a pure data-driven LSTM were forced under warming scenarios, and the monthly hydrographs and total runoff ratios metrics were evaluated relative to the benchmarks. The results demonstrated: (1) For monthly hydrographs, dNN exhibited advantages in capturing cold-season runoff increase and warm-season recession than LSTM, effectively predicting the changes and trends in monthly runoff under warming scenarios; (2) For total runoff ratios, dNN predicted fewer catchments with increased runoff, indicating it can better maintain the total water budget under warming scenarios; (3) Through the synergy with physics, dNN was able to reasonably infer unobserved snowpack dynamics under warming scenarios. These results highlight the credibility and necessity of considering physics for DL in predicting runoff responses under climate change.

 Early identification of rubber plantations holds significant importance for both optimal plantation management and scientific studies. Even though remote sensing techniques for mapping rubber plantations have evolved considerably since the 2000s, current methods are highly effective in detecting mature rubber plantations (MRPs), which have distinctive forest characteristics, but often fail to identify immature rubber plantations (IRPs) in a timely manner. This leads to an estimated lag of at least five years in the resulting rubber plantation maps. This paper presents a novel algorithm aimed at promptly pinpointing IRPs in the early planting stage by harnessing a composite of multi-source time series satellite imagery on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Twelve scenarios with different time intervals (3 months, 6 months, and 12 months) and datasets (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1) were tested to determine the most efficient strategy for identifying IRPs using a random forest algorithm. The results demonstrate that the data cube constructed from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 with 3-month time intervals yields the most accurate identification accuracy. Specifically, it achieves a remarkable overall accuracy of 0.78, 0.87, and 0.93 for plantations established during the second, third, and fourth years, respectively. When implemented on Hainan Island, China’s second-largest natural rubber producing base, the algorithm unveiled a significant decline trend in rubber plantation areas since 2015. Additionally, the spatial distribution exhibited pronounced heterogeneity: while the western and northern regions saw dense immature plantation clusters, the eastern coastal regions hosted only sparse plantations. These up-to-date maps of IRPs are valuable in predicting rubber production, enhancing the monitoring and management practices, and promoting the sustainable development of natural rubber industry."

In assessments of the secondary disaster risks, the post-wildfire vegetation cover change plays a key role in influencing the distribution and intensity of the risks. In this work, a processing framework for mapping post-wildfire vegetation cover changes through information fusion has been generated and tested using Landsat8 and WorldView imagery data. The test site was the boreal forest region surrounding Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, affected by a massive wildfire in May 2016. The derived map results indicate that the fusion process in the framework is effective for generation of post-wildfire vegetation cover change information. The use of WorldView data revealed more variation details in distribution of the vegetation cover burn damages than use of Landsat data. Moreover, the uncertainty in vegetation burn severity using Landsat-based Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) index exists in the areas with low dNBR reading values due to the sub-pixel effect. The forest burn severity measured with dNBR index can be underestimated due to the quick herbaceous cover recovery after wildfire. These uncertainties in the post-wildfire vegetation cover mapping should be taken into consideration when the derived information is being used for risk assessments."

 Forest fragmentation is a significant issue in China; however, a comprehensive understanding and assessment of the temporal trends and spatial modes of forest fragmentation remain lacking. For the first time, this study employs an object-based morphological image processing method to conduct multiscale spatiotemporal identification and analysis of China’s forest landscape from 1985 to 2023. Observations reveal an overall improvement in the integrity of China’s forest landscape from 1985 to 2023, with 79 % of counties showing a positive trend in forest landscape integrity and 5 % experiencing forest fragmentation. The forest core area in China has almost tripled from 1985 to 2023, expanding from 0.57 to 1.53 million km2. Nevertheless, 32.04 % of forests in China remain within 100 m of a non-forest edge, significantly higher than the global average (∼20 %). From 1985 to 2023, out of the 0.33 million km2 of newly planted forests, 29.5 % became forest cores, while the remaining 70.5 % constituted forest edges. This underscores the need for government planning to focus not only on expanding forest areas but also on enhancing the integrity of forest landscapes, thereby creating more ecologically valuable forest ecosystems. Analysis indicates that 25 % of forest fragmentation in China is associated with agriculture (16 %) and urbanization (9 %), while the remaining portion is linked to local topography, climate, and other natural boundaries for forest distribution. Although natural boundaries play a predominant role in forest fragmentation, there is a growing trend of agricultural activities and urbanization encroaching upon the edges. It is recommended that government policies prioritize strategic planning for forest landscape integrity, considering both quantitative expansion and qualitative optimization, to ensure the sustainable development of China’s forest ecosystems."

 Accurate delineation of agricultural parcels is crucial for ensuring food security and implementing precision agriculture practices. However, one of the primary challenges in parcel delineation revolves around the accurate extraction of parcel edges due to the diverse morphologies of these parcels. Current deep learning models for agricultural parcel delineation often produce unclosed or incomplete edges, highlighting the need to enhance the edge-awareness of the model. In this study, we proposed a refined edge-aware U-Net (REAUNet) to extract accurate agricultural parcel boundaries from Sentinel-2 images and GF-2 images. REAUNet integrates four innovative components for edge enhancement, i.e., the deep supervision, the edge detection block, the dual attention block and the refine module. The edge detection block and the dual attention block strengthen the ability of capturing spatial contextual information, and the deep supervision constrains parcel delineation across multiple scales, and the refine module further refines the parcel edges. Together, these components enhance the edge-awareness of the model, resulting in more accurate agricultural parcel delineation. From the ablation experiment, REAUNet with all four components reached the higher accuracy than the scenarios that only three out of four components were retained, which suggested that the inclusion of all four components was essential. The comparative evaluation showed that our proposed model surpassed the representative deep learning models for both thematic and geomantic accuracy. REAUNet demonstrated an increase of 2.0 % in F1-score and a decrease of 3.4 % in GTC (Global Total-Classification) compared to the SEANet, and exhibited a 0.8 % increase in IoU and a 2 % decrease in GTC relative to the MPSPNet. We also assessed the capability of the REAUNet model transferred for a new geographic region, and reported that a pre-train REAUNet model with only a small number of local samples could achieve a satisfactory accuracy. To conclude, the newly proposed REAUNet model reaches a high mapping accuracy for delineating agricultural parcels from the high-resolution images. With the powerful edge-aware capability, REAUNet can effectively utilize limited training samples to transfer a deep learning model for a new region, facilitating the generation of agricultural parcel products and a large-scale agricultural parcel mapping in practical applications."

 Remote sensing of optically complex inland waterbodies is challenging due to the complex nonlinear correlation between water quality parameters and water optical properties. However, integration of deep learning techniques and representative datasets offers the potential to address these challenges effectively. This study aims to develop robust deep learning models, utilizing limited but highly representative dataset of in-situ water quality and radiometrically corrected hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) measurements collected from optically diverse lakes of China, for independent and simultaneous retrieval of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Secchi Disk Depth (SDD), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) using Sentinel-2 analysis ready products. The GLObal Reflectance community dataset for Imaging and optical sensing of Aquatic environments (GLORIA) provides over 400 such measurements for Chinese lakes, which are simulated to Sentinel-2 Rrs with its spectral response function to build a representative dataset. Using this dataset, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are developed and compared with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The DNN models outperformed in effective evaluation of Chl-a (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 14.18 mg/m3), TSS (RMSE=7.23 g/m3) and SDD (RMSE=0.12 m) on test datasets and Chl-a (RMSE=14.42 mg/m3) and SDD (RMSE=0.07 m) against Sentinel-2A validation dataset of Liangzi lake. Mixed Density Network (MDN) model showed less accuracy for Chl-a (RMSE=16.76 mg/m3) on same validation dataset. Impact of different atmospheric correction processors is also assessed and DNN models achieved their accuracy on Sentinel-2 Atmospheric Correction (Sen2Cor) processor. Finally, water quality maps for various lakes in China are produced showing realistic ranges. These results show the potential of DNN models trained with limited but representative dataset in practical applications for spatial and temporal analysis of water quality."

 The semantic segmentation of land use and land cover (LULC) is a crucial and widely employed remote sensing task. Conventional convolutional neural networks and vision transformers have been extensively utilized for LULC segmentation. However, high-resolution remote sensing images contain a wealth of spatial and color texture information, which is not fully exploited by traditional deep learning approaches. The information bottleneck of CNNs and transformers results in the loss of a significant amount of texture detail information during the feature extraction process, which further limits the performance of LULC segmentation. We present DDPM-SegFormer, a new framework that merges a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and vision transformer for LULC segmentation. The aim is to address the difficulties arising from extraction in complex geographic landscapes and to alleviate information bottlenecks. The framework utilizes the ability of a DDPM to generate refined semantic features and that of vision transformer to model the global image context. Our framework introduces two main innovations. First, we use a DDPM for the first time in LULC segmentation to generate highly refined multiscale semantic features. This approach alleviates the information bottleneck caused by relying solely on a CNN or transformer architecture. Second, we develop an effective feature-level fusion strategy that utilizes multihead cross-attention between the DDPM and Transformer. This approach achieves the harmonious fusion of fine-scale semantic features, generating continuous and highly refined semantic features that enhance the segmentation accuracy. The results indicate that DDPM-SegFormer achieves an MIOU of 83.72% and an F1-score of 90.97% for the large-scale LoveDA dataset and an MIOU of 90.91% and an F1score of 93.30% for the Tarim Basin LULC dataset in a desert scenario. The research demonstrated that the refined and continuous semantic features produced by DDPM-SegFormer can significantly enhance LULC segmentation performance."

 Deep learning has significantly advanced hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, primarily due to its robust nonlinear feature extraction capabilities. The vision transformer has achieved notable performance but is limited by the quadratic computational burden of its self-attention mechanism. Recently, a network based on state space model named Mamba, has attracted considerable attention for its linear complexity and commendable performance. Nevertheless, Mamba was originally designed for one-dimensional causal sequence modeling, and its effectiveness in inherent non-causal HSI classification remains to be fully validated. To address this issue, we propose a novel Local Enhanced Mamba (LE-Mamba) network for hyperspectral image classification, which mainly comprises a Local Enhanced Spatial SSM (LES-S6), a Central Region Spectral SSM (CRS-S6), and a Multi-Scale Convolutional Gated Unit (MSCGU). The LES-S6 improves non-causal local feature extraction by incorporating a multi-directional local spatial scanning mechanism. Additionally, the CRS-S6 employs a bidirectional scanning mechanism in the spectral dimension to capture fine spectral details and integrate them with spatial information. The MSCGU utilizes a convolutional gating mechanism to aggregate features from diverse scanning routes and extract high-level semantic information. The overall accuracies of LE-Mamba on Indian Pines, WHU-Hi-HanChuan, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and Pavia University datasets are 99.16 %, 98.16 %, 99.57 %, and 99.63 %, respectively. Extensive experimental results on these four public datasets demonstrate that the LE-Mamba outperforms eight mainstream deep learning models in classification performance."

 Semantic segmentation of high-resolution multispectral remote sensing image has been intensely studied. However, the shadow occlusions, or the similar color and textures, between the categories influence the segmentation accuracy. Concomitantly, the size of targets in the remote sensing images is diverse and the network cannot balance their segmentation. This paper introduces a network, Transformer-based Multi-modal Fusion Network (TMFNet), which fuses the multi-modal features and incorporates height features from the digital surface model (DSM) to supplement the extra different features between each category. Particularly, we introduce two parallel encoders to extract the features from different modalities, a Multi-Modal fusion model based on the Transformer (MMformer) to complete the multi-modal fusion, and a Border Region Attention based multi-level Fusion Module (BRAFM) to integrate the cross-level features and enhance the small target segmentation by utilizing the details around the border.

 Recently, deep learning methods have shown outstanding performance in remote sensing change detection (CD). To improve the accuracy of edge regions, researchers have introduced edge information as prior knowledge into CD methods. However, there is still room for improvement in utilizing edge information. In this study, an edge-guided multi-scale foreground attention network (EMAF) with an innovative and effective strategy is proposed. Our edge-guided strategy focuses on incorporating edge information into the feature fusion process at all levels. EMAF firstly employs a Siamese Resnet-34 as the encoder, producing four levels of bi-temporal features. Secondly, the Foreground Module (FM) is introduced to separate foreground and background at each level, resulting in foreground change features. Then, the Edge Fusion Module (EFM) is introduced to fuse the features of two adjacent levels with the edge probability map obtained by the Edge Extraction Module (EEM). Finally, after performing EFM and EEM in the three levels, EMAF generates the final change map and edge probability map. During the deep supervision training, the Dynamic Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (DWBCE) loss is calculated as the edge loss. The comparison testing results on WHU-CD, SYSU-CD, and LEVIR-CD datasets validate the effectiveness of EMAF. Notably, EMAF achieves impressive Intersection over Union (IoU) of 89.03% on WHU-CD and 71.04% on SYSU-CD datasets."

 Automatic crop mapping is essential for various agricultural applications. Although fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have shown effectiveness in crop mapping, they rely on labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods offer a solution by enabling pixel-level segmentation with less costly annotations, such as point, bounding box (bbox), and image-level annotations. However, these weak annotations often lack complete object information, leading to reduced accuracy. Moreover, there is limited exploration of WSSS methods in medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as Sentinel-2. Therefore, this study proposes SAMWS, a WSSS method based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for crop mapping using Sentinel-2 time series images. Leveraging SAM, our method can generate high-quality pseudo labels and accommodate various weak annotations without extensive adjustments. SAMWS comprises three stages: 1) finetuning SAM with adapters; 2) generating pseudo labels using weak annotations and finetuned SAM; and 3) training a segmentation network using pseudo labels for crop mapping. Experiments conducted on PASTIS and Munich datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. After SAM was finetuned with adapters, the F1-scores for parcel segmentation using point and bbox prompts increased by 75.0 % and 14.4 %, respectively, reaching 0.880 and 0.931. Additionally, our method achieves classification results closest to fully supervised learning when using point, bbox, and image-level annotations, with F1-scores of 0.810, 0.817, and 0.779, respectively. Our approach offers valuable insights into leveraging foundation models in the remote sensing domain and contains significant potential for crop monitoring.

 Extracting road network maps for high-resolution remote sensing images is a critical and challenging remote sensing topic, with significant importance for traffic navigation, disaster management, autonomous driving, and urban planning. Although deep learning has demonstrated its powerful feature extraction capabilities in image processing tasks, including road extraction, existing road extraction algorithms still have some limitations. In particular, semantic segmentation-based methods often lack supervision of the connection relationships between roads and topological correctness constraints, resulting in fragmented and poorly connected road network graphs. Moreover, graph-based methods lack effective supervision strategies for vertex misdetection issues. To deal with these issues, we propose a deeply supervised vertex network (DSVNet) for road network graph extraction. First, to effectively supervise road vertices, we design a road vertex supervision module that yields improved vertex prediction accuracy. Second, to merge the benefits of segmentation-based methods and graph-based methods, we establish a parallel semantic segmentation branch based on the vertex querying task, thereby achieving enhanced road extraction accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce deformable attention into the model to boost its performance and computational efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of DSVNet on two large-scale public datasets.

 The fusion of remote sensing and artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, offers substantial opportunities for developing innovative methods in rapid disaster mapping and damage assessment. However, current models for wildfire burnt area detection and mapping are mostly constrained in handling imbalanced training samples with non-burnt areas oversampled, boundary areas with a mix of burnt and unburnt pixels, and regions with varying environmental contexts, leading to poor model generalizability. In response, this paper proposes a novel U-Net based model, known as BiAU-Net, which incorporates attention mechanisms and a well-designed loss function, enabling the model to focus on burnt areas and improve accuracy and efficiency, especially in detecting edges and small areas. Unlike traditional single-input U-Net models for image segmentation, the proposed BiAU-Net considers and incorporates temporal changes with two inputs, pre- and post-fire Sentinel-2 imagery, enhancing performance across diverse environmental areas. Five independent areas from different continents are selected as study cases, one for training the model and all five for testing, to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed model. We used the Fire Disturbance Climate Change Initiative v5.1 product from the European Space Agency as a baseline for model evaluation.

 The frequent occurrence of urban floods (UFs) poses significant threats to citizens’ lives and the national economy. Utilizing machine learning to assess urban flood susceptibility (UFS) provides valuable decision support for UF management. However, the precision of current studies is usually influenced by the variability of temporal factors like extreme rainfall, which limits the accurate identification of urban flood-susceptible regions (UFSRs). To address this issue, we present a novel approach that leverages the spatiotemporal distribution and characteristics of UFS to accurately identify UFSRs. In our case study of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China, we employed the Random Forest to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of UFS. We then used the Savitzky-Golay filter to correct UFS data based on the UFS time series from 2011 to 2020. The Theil-Sen median slope, Mann-Kendall test, and Hurst analysis were used to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of UFS. Shapley additive explanation was applied to quantify the contribution of selected variables. Our findings include: (1) UFS in the GBA demonstrates a rising trend, with high susceptibility areas increasing from 6.3 % in 2011 to 7.4 % in 2020; (2) UFSRs, covering approximately 11 % of the GBA, are primarily concentrated in the cities located around the central GBA; and (3) human behavior factors have a more significant influence on UF than natural ones.

 Nowadays, embedding-based pan-sharpening networks aimed at fusing panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images are abundant, yet their results still show spectral distortion and spatial fuzziness. In this paper, we design a multi-scale fusion structure to minimize the gap between the pan-sharpened image and the reference image progressively. Specifically, we proposed a method based on the scale difference between PAN and MS images, using a convolutional neural network embedding pixel difference enhanced module (PDEM) to obtain the pan-sharpened image and minimizing the losses from each scale. The network includes three scales, each scale contains the PDEM to generate the intermediate results until to the last scale which obtains the final pan-sharpened result. The designed PDEM extracts deep features from PAN and MS images, using different kernel sizes and receptive field scales to diversify the extracted information. Three-direction pixel difference convolutions (PDCs) are utilized to maintain and enhance the edge details of spatial information. The loss function is to sum up the mean square error and mean absolute error between the pan-sharpened image and the reference image at three scales.

The network demonstrates superior performance in detecting weak and small targets in complex ground environments, achieving significant improvements over baseline methods and showcasing the potential of the group target detection approach. 
 Small target detection in remote sensing is integral to a range of applications, including smart city systems and emergency rescue operations. However, the challenges posed by weak features and complex backgrounds in remote sensing images have hindered the efficacy of detection. Current models tend to focus on identifying individual targets, resulting in algorithms with larger parameters, slower detection efficiency, and difficulty in striking a balance between false positives and negatives. Given that many tasks do not require precise target location, a more efficient approach involves swiftly predicting target areas with models involving fewer parameters. This paper introduces the concept of group target distribution detection, gathering targets with similar distances and semantic similarities for clustered detection. A Gaussian probability map, formed from target density, is used to train a probability prediction model. We propose a new metric for evaluating this innovative group target distribution detection paradigm and provide a comparative assessment with traditional single-object detection models. In experimental evaluation, our proposed DenseUGE network — employing ResNet34 and ResNet50 as its backbone — surpasses the best baseline method by 3.37% on the AI-TOD dataset using our metrics. Additionally, visualizations demonstrate the ability of our proposed methodology to effectively identify the concentrated distribution of small target groups."

 Understanding soil moisture dynamics is crucial for crop growth. The digital mapping of field soil moisture distribution provides valuable information for agricultural water management. The optical satellite data provides fine scale soil moisture information for a region. However, these data are greatly limited due to cloud contamination and revisit period. Despite the reported beneficial effects of spatiotemporal fusion methods, the accurate estimates of high-resolution soil moisture through spatiotemporal fusion data are still unclear, particularly when using Sentinel-2/3 fusion images. This study introduces a new soil moisture estimation framework integrating spatio-temporal spectral information from Sentinel-2/3 fusion images and machine learning algorithm,and thus provide spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture estimation. The framework includes four fusion methods (ESTARRFM, Fit-FC, FSDAF and STFMF) and four machine learning models (PLSR, SVM, RF and GBRT). The feasibility of the framework was validated in the Hetao Irrigation Area of Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that the Sentinel-2/3 fused image generated by Fit-FC was visually the closest to the true image, followed by ESTARFM, FSDAF, and STFMF. The spatiotemporal fusion-machine learning estimation framework provided reliable estimation for multi-layer (0 ∼ 20, 20 ∼ 40 and 40 ∼ 60 cm) soil water in the irrigation area. The dense time series of soil water generated by the framework facilitated the detection of irrigation events in the irrigated farmland. Our findings highlighted the effectiveness of Sentinel-2/3 fused images in providing high-resolution continuous daily monitoring of farmland soil water on a large scale. These high spatial–temporal resolution time series are valuable for monitoring crop growth and water resource management, contributing to further expanding the application of satellite remote sensing in precision agriculture."

 Analyzing spatially varying effects is pivotal in geographic analysis. However, accurately capturing and interpreting this variability is challenging due to the increasing complexity and non-linearity of geospatial data. Recent advancements in integrating Geographically Weighted (GW) models with artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies offer novel approaches. However, these methods often focus on single algorithms and emphasize prediction over interpretability. The recent GeoShapley method integrates machine learning (ML) with Shapley values to explain the contribution of geographical features, advancing the combination of geospatial ML and explainable AI (XAI). Yet, it lacks exploration of the nonlinear interactions between geographical features and explanatory variables. Herein, an ensemble framework is proposed to merge local spatial weighting scheme with XAI and ML technologies to bridge this gap. Through tests on synthetic datasets and comparisons with GWR, MGWR, and GeoShapley, this framework is verified to enhance interpretability and predictive accuracy by elucidating spatial variability. Reproducibility is explored through the comparison of spatial weighting schemes and various ML models, emphasizing the necessity of model reproducibility to address model and parameter uncertainty.

 Existing deep learning-based hyperspectral anomaly detection methods typically perform anomaly detection by reconstructing a clean background. However, for the deep networks, there are many parameters that need to be adjusted. To reduce parameters of network and improve the performance of anomaly detection, a light CNN based on residual learning and background estimation was proposed. Different from traditional methods, the proposed method could directly learn anomaly features rather than background features. First, during the training stage, a background estimation method based on non-central convolution kernels was used to obtain the pseudo-background. Second, to purify the pseudo-background, a pair down-sampling method and a joint loss that combines cross-approximation background loss and consistency loss were proposed. Third, the anomaly matrix was obtained by the difference between the hyperspectral image (HSI) and the pseudo-background. Fourth, a light CNN with three layers was proposed to extract features of the anomaly matrix. Finally, during the prediction stage, anomaly detection results were calculated from the predicted anomaly matrix obtained by light CNN through the Mahalanobis distance.

 To reduce the high redundancy of band information in hyperspectral data, various band optimization methods have been adopted, which could be divided into two types namely band extraction (e.g., principal component analysis, PCA) and band selection (e.g., Spearman correlation coefficient, SRC). However, the applicability and effectiveness of different band optimization methods were rarely reported in the literature. Therefore, based on the rock sample data of the Baixintan deposit, we compare the performance of two band optimization algorithms (principal component analysis−based band extraction and SRC-based band selection) in inverting metal elements (Cu, Fe, Ni, Cr, Mg) using the adaptive genetic algorithms-gradient boosting regression tree (AGA-GBRT) algorithm. Two band optimization methods have shown different effects in improving the accuracy of target metal elements. The five models with the highest accuracy in metal elements include LT-R-Cu, LT-PCA-Fe, ORI-PCA-Ni, SDT-PCA-Cr, and LT-PCAMg. In the established model, the inversion accuracy of the Cu element is the lowest, possibly due to the high variability of the data itself (coefficient of variation is 3.55). Fe and Ni highly correlated with Cu elements were used to indirectly invert Cu element. Compared with the direct inversion model, the accuracy of the indirect inversion model has increased by 11%. Overall, PCA is more effective than SRC in predicting the content of metal elements in rocks. The conclusion presented in this article provides a ground experimental basis and technical support for future optimization of hyperspectral bands and inversion methods of metal element content in rocks."

 Agricultural drought is a major natural disaster affecting biomass accumulation and causing food loss, exacerbated by the increasing frequency of flash droughts and compounded drought-heatwave events. Traditional optical remote sensing indices cannot directly represent the water content of vegetation, resulting in a limited understanding of crop response to drought. To address this gap, we investigated the responsiveness of microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) with four bands (L-, C-, X-, KU-) and four emerging VOD-derived products to drought conditions in crops in the Midwest US. These products include the normalized Difference Between Night and Day VOD (nVOD), Slope of the Regression of Day and Night VOD (σ), Standardized VOD Index (SVODI), and VOD to estimate Gross Primary Productivity (VOD2GPP). They employ different theoretical modeling approaches to crop growth and water use strategies. We comprehensively analyzed the trend, seasonality, and residual of VODs, using Leaf Area Index (LAI) for comparison, and further assessed the lagged and cumulative effects, quantified drought sensitivity, and captured responsiveness to cumulative drought using thresholds. The results showed a time lag in the response of VOD series to drought as indicated by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). VODs achieved faster responses and higher correlations compared to LAI. Among them, VOD_L exhibited the most statistically significant pixels (39.84%) and positive Rmax-lag with 96.81% of all pixels. For cumulative effects, VOD_L, VOD_C, VOD_X, VOD_KU, and SVODI were highly correlated in the early stages of droughts. We also found that crops in Iowa exhibited medium to high drought sensitivity (average values of 0.55 to 0.74), with the highest drought sensitivity calculated using the isohydricity indicator, σ. Based on threshold comparison, σ showed a timely response in the first month of drought (average of −0.62), whereas VOD_L and VOD_C performed best in the second month (both averaging −1.85), and VOD2GPP (−2.94) was the most responsive in the third month. Due to water use strategy, maize responded more quickly to the onset of drought compared to soybeans. Overall, the results demonstrated that VOD is promising for crop phenology and drought research. This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of the diverse capabilities of multiple VOD-based indices in drought monitoring across various timescales and croplands."

 Climate change, particularly extreme weather events, has significantly affected various sectors, including agriculture, human health, water resources, sea levels, and ecosystems. It is anticipated that the intensity, duration, and frequency of these extremes will escalate in the future. This study aims to discover the association between temperature extremes and agricultural yield and to project these extremes using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models with CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) data under two SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). A bi-wavelet coherence technique is employed to investigate the association, providing detailed information in both the frequency and time domains for the period of 1980–2014. Various ML and DL models are trained and tested for the periods of 1985–2004 and 2005–2014, respectively, with gradient boosting machine chosen for projecting temperature extremes based on its superior performance. Mann-Kendall test is used for trend analysis in the projected temperature extremes. The results indicate strong negative and positive associations between TN10p (Cold nights) and TN90p (Warm nights), respectively, with wheat production. Additionally, there is a long-term negative association of CSDI (Cold Spell Duration Indicator) and strong positive association of WSDI (Warm Spell Duration Indicator) with rice yield. Projected results show an increase and decrease under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, in DTR (Diurnal Temperature Range) at most stations. TN10p will increase in the future at most stations, with exceptions such as Muree station where it decreases during 2025–2049 and then increases under both SSPs. Projections show that TXn (annual or monthly minimum value of daily maximum temp) will increase in the future, with Muree station exhibiting the lowest value close to zero, while the average maximum value is around 20 °C at Khanpur station. Trend analysis reveals significantly increasing trend in TR20 (Tropical nights) and decreasing trend in CSDI in future durations under both SSPs.

 Accurate mapping of irrigated croplands is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of agricultural practices and land management. Despite recent advancements, there remains room for further exploration of the effective fusion of temporal information from multitemporal remote sensing images, which is essential for capturing the dynamic nature of agricultural landscapes. Many existing irrigation mapping methods concatenate multitemporal images in a direct way and thus neglect the temporal relationships within the image time series, especially the sequence and interdependencies of the temporal dimension. To address this gap, a novel deep learning model, named the attention-enhanced spatial–temporal high-resolution network (AEST-HRNet), which incorporates parallel processing and a fusion mechanism of multiresolution information streams, three-dimensional (3D) spatial–temporal convolution, and temporal attention modules, was proposed. When applied to irrigated regions in Washington and California, USA, AEST-HRNet effectively extracted irrigated areas using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images obtained with the Google Earth Engine (GEE). To validate the results, 208 representative sample patches were selected, and the AEST-HRNet maps were compared against third-party ground reference data and statistics from the United States National Agricultural Statistics Survey (NASS). Quantitative assessment revealed an impressive F1-score of 0.956, an intersection over union (IoU) value of 0.867, and an overall accuracy (OA) value of 0.973 in Washington, outperforming publicly released maps.

 Vegetation is one of the most crucial components of terrestrial ecosystems, and monitoring vegetation change as well as studying the factors that drive its formation provide significant guidance for restoring ecological biodiversity. The choice of driving indicators for vegetation change in previous studies has not been comprehensive enough, and particularly groundwater depth has not been considered. Therefore, 10 natural factors and 5 human factors were chosen for our study. We adopted the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to measure vegetation growth. In this study, we utilized trend analysis, the Mann-Kendall test, and the Hurst index to investigate the spatiotemporal variance of NDVI in the YDRB. The geographical detector model (Geodetector) was employed to examine vegetation change attributed to human and natural variables. As a result of the study, we found that over the past 22 years, the NDVI in the basin increased from 0.62 to 0.70, with an increase of +0.0040/yr. Land use type is the most significant driver affecting NDVI changes. The interaction of two factors has a greater effect on vegetation change more than a single factor. The relationship between land use type and annual mean precipitation explained 34.5 % of the change in vegetation. Groundwater depth contributed 4.1 % to the explanation of vegetation change. Furthermore, we have determined the optimal range of specific variables conducive to vegetation growth. The results help us further understand the potential driving mechanism of vegetation cover change in the YDRB and provide a theoretical reference for relevant managers to formulate the ecological restoration measures in the basin."

 Sea breeze front (SBF) is one of the important weather systems affecting the occurrence and development of severe convective weather in the Bohai Bay region (BBR). 226 cases of merger-type SBFs (MSBFs) merged with gust fronts (GFs) and convective systems (CSs), respectively, were identified based on Doppler weather radar data and ground-based automatic weather station data from May to September during 2009–2018 in the BBR, and their basic tempo-spatial characteristics and associated atmospheric circulation backgrounds are documented for the first time.The number of MSBFs cases merged with GFs (MSBF-GFs) and that of MSBFs merged with CSs (MSBF-CSs) were 172 and 54, respectively. The number of MSBFs varied significantly in each year, with 37 (13) in the most (least) frequent year, and with an average number of 22.6 per year. More than 93.8 % of the MSBFs occurred from June to August, especially most frequent (37.2 %) in July. The merging locations of the MSBFs were mainly distributed in the central-northern Tianjin and the southeastern Hebei province, and the horizontal scales of MSBFs were mainly distributed in the range of 130–309 km. About 29.6 % (51.9 %) of the MSBF-CSs cases resulted in significantly (slightly) enhanced convections, while 51.4 % (23.8 %) of the MSBF-GFs bring about significantly (slightly) enhanced convections. About 72.1 % of the MSBF-GFs cases are merged in near “face-to-face” form, and their 49.2 % (23.4 %) proportion lead to significantly (slightly) enhanced convections. The atmospheric circulation patterns of MSBFs identified using objective classification method showed that, the major two patterns (occupied 56.6 % cases) have similar dynamic, thermodynamic, and water vapor characteristics including westerlies or southwesterlies with intensity about 8–10 m/s at 500 hPa, showing significant warm and moist air delivered from the south and relatively weak vertical wind shear along with intense water vapor convergence at 850 hPa."

 Shallow-water benthic habitat classification of coral reefs based on satellite remote sensing is an important part of coral reef monitoring. Leveraging its potent capacity for feature learning, and generalization, deep learning emerges as a robust method for coral reef benthic habitat classification. Due to the complexity of the marine environment, it is difficult to produce high-quality pixel-by-pixel labels for deep learning-based methods, which makes it challenging to recover structural details of coral reef benthic habitats. Bathymetry data can provide spatial contextual information and geometric features, serving as auxiliary features to provide abundant structural information for benthic classification models. However, how to use bathymetry and what kind of bathymetry features to employ for assisting model learning remains to be explored. Therefore, a bathymetry feature fusion-weakly supervised coral reef benthic habitat classification model (BFFBHCM) is proposed. BFFBHCM is supervised by sparse benthic habitat samples with bathymetry and can generate dense, multi-scale bathymetry features. With the robust bathymetry-benthic feature fusion module (B-BFFM), BFFBHCM can consider both semantic and structural details of the benthic habitats, thus generating highly accurate benthic habitat classification results. Experiments were conducted using the NJUReef + dataset containing 10 coral reefs in the Spratly Islands, China, constructed based on in-situ data. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BFFBHCM is insensitive to the vertical error in bathymetry, with an average mIoU 22.54 % higher than state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, it outperforms the weakly-supervised method that excludes bathymetry by 10.14 %, and still exhibits generalization to coral reefs in different regions around the world."

 The rapid progression of the intelligent grid requires continuous vigilance in monitoring and maintaining extensive powerline corridors to ensure their safety. In this context, LiDAR technology, renowned for its exceptional precision and reduced vulnerability to external interference, emerges as a valuable alternative for monitoring powerline corridors. This contrasts with conventional methods such as manual field inspections and imprecise sensors. However, the vast amount of data generated by LiDAR presents significant challenges, including scene noise, diverse scenarios, and unwanted objects proximate to powerlines or pylons. These factors complicate the accurate extraction and analysis of relevant data from point clouds produced by LiDAR. This review examines recent methodologies aimed at overcoming these challenges. It begins with a brief exploration of data collection systems for powerline corridors, including TLS, MLS, UAVLS, ALS, and CIR, highlighting their respective merits and drawbacks. The subsequent sections of the review provide a comprehensive overview of three methodological categories: tracking and detection-based approaches, machine learning-based techniques, and deep learning-based methods. Within each category, representative techniques are delineated, elucidating their potential, limitations, and applicable domains. This review incorporates qualitative analysis to enhance researchers' comprehension of current studies and to providea nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques. In a departure from previous research, this review extends its focus beyond powerline extraction to include the extraction of pylons and single wires. It identifies a notable oversight in the lack of emphasis on individual wire extraction, attributing this to challenges posed by wire proximity, and highlights limited attention to pylon extraction near vegetation. While machine learning and deep learning methods offer heightened automation, persistent issues such as the requirement for extensive labeled samples and inadequate model generalization, underscore the need for continued efforts to address these challenges. This discussion emphasizes the necessity of overcoming these hurdles to boost ongoing advancements in powerline and pylon extraction techniques."

 High-quality surface reconstruction and texture reconstruction of large-scale scene play a pivotal role in the domains of ancient architecture, cultural heritage preservation, and 3D urban modeling. Given that point cloud data has emerged as a crucial medium for representing three-dimensional spatial information, its utilization for surface and texture reconstruction becomes indispensable. In this research, we propose a novel framework for reconstructing surface and texture from unstructured colorful point clouds without normal information to restore large-scale real-world scenes. Specifically, we first introduce an automatic virtual viewpoint selection method to generate virtual views by rendering the point cloud from multiple viewpoints. Subsequently, we construct a two-step network to facilitate accurate visibility prediction and texture inpainting for each virtual view. Then, the visibility information from multiple perspectives is integrated to solve an optimization problem incorporating visibility constraints, resulting in the generation of a 3D mesh. Subsequently, texture information from various perspectives is integrated, filtering techniques are applied to determine the optimal perspective for texturing, and a texture atlas is generated. Precise texture mapping is then performed, ultimately leading to the production of a comprehensive textured model. In contrast to alternative learning-based methodologies, our framework exclusively learns from two-dimensional images, encompassing the prediction of both visible and invisible points as well as the execution of image inpainting tasks. This approach exhibits exceptional versatility in managing large-scale point clouds while effectively leveraging the color and intensity attributes of the data for precise texture reconstruction. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant improvement of 2.06% in F-scores for outdoor surface reconstruction compared to the current state-of-the-art learning-based methods, while also outperforming them in texture reconstruction."

 Equipped with the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) of 532 nm, the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) is enabled to penetrate the water surface to retrieve water depth information at certain depths. However, signal photon extraction is significantly impacted by noise and varying terrain conditions, particularly in deep water regions with weaker signal photons. To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel bathymetric signal extraction method for ICESat-2/ATLAS data based on adaptive rotating ellipse and B-spline curve iterative filtering. First, raw photons are segregated into water surface and bottom photons using the specular return removal algorithm and combined with the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to derive water surface elevation. Second, our method employs the modified Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) with adaptive variable ellipse and B-spline curve iterative filtering to detect bottom signal photons. Following refraction and tidal corrections, water depth is computed. Finally, the bathymetric accuracy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using manually labeled photons and airborne bathymetric LiDAR data. The experimental results indicate the proposed algorithm’s superior F_score value, which increased by about 6.6 % and 4.1 % compared with the high-confidence photons and Adaptive Variable Ellipse Filtering Bathymetric Method (AVEBM). Moreover, the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAE) of bathymetric accuracy is 0.47 m, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 0.55 m, and Coefficient of Determination (R2) of bathymetric accuracy is 0.93. The proposed method effectively extracts signal photons and provides accurate water depth for nearshore bathymetry estimation."

 Three-dimensional laser scanning technology is widely employed in various fields due to its advantage in rapid acquisition of geographic scene structures. Achieving high precision and automated semantic segmentation of three-dimensional point cloud data remains a vital challenge in point cloud recognition. This study introduces a Multilevel Intuitive Attention Network (MIA-Net) designed for point cloud segmentation. MIA-Net consists of three key components: local trigonometric function encoding, feature sampling, and intuitive attention interaction. Initially, trigonometric encoding captures fine-grained local semantics within disordered point clouds. Subsequently, a multilayer perceptron addresses point-cloud feature pyramid construction, and feature sampling is performed using the point offset mechanism in the different levels. Finally, the multilevel intuitive attention(MIA) mechanism facilitates feature interactions across different layers, enabling the capture of both local attention features and global structure. The point-offset attention scheme introduced in this study significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional attention mechanisms, enhancing computational efficiency while preserving the advantages of attention mechanisms. To evaluate the results of MIA-Net, the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark, LASDU and GML airborne datasets were tested. Experiments show that our network can achieve state-of-art performance in terms of Overall Accuracy(OA) and average F1-score(e.g., reaching 96.2% and 66.7% for GML datasets, respectively)."

 Accurate mapping of terrain elevations at a large scale and fine resolution can characterize the detailed surface height and geomorphic changes and is very critical for the studies of the internal motions and external forces of the earth. The emergence of the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) offers unprecedented possibilities for global elevation mapping with high vertical accuracy using three-dimensional photon points. However, the ICESat-2 photon points are still sparse in terms of spatial/horizontal resolution, making it unable to satisfy the high-resolution demand of terrain elevation mapping and digital elevation model production. A few previous studies have attempted to estimate elevations/topography in regions with single landscape and landcover (e.g., forest, shallow water, and polar regions) by combining ICESat-2 data with other passive satellite remotely sensed data. However, the potential and capability of ICESat-2 for mapping elevations for spatially continuous large regions with multiple complicated land cover types remains unknown. In this study, a spatially continuous large-scale terrain elevation estimation method is developed under multiple land covers based on the random forest model and the freely accessed satellite data of ICESat-2, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. The core principle is to construct a random forest model that can characterize the complicated relationships of the ICESat-2 ATL03 terrain elevations and their corresponding land cover related polarization characteristics and spectral variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, respectively. Integrating the superiorities of the data of these three different satellites enables the proposed method to extrapolate the terrain elevations with decimeter-level vertical accuracy and 10 m spatial/horizontal resolution simultaneously without any prior in situ data or manually set parameters. The proposed method is tested using the elevations from 2021 to 2022 at the third largest island (Chongming Island, Shanghai) in China. The estimated terrain elevations are locally validated with the airborne LiDAR-derived elevations. Moreover, they are compared with the ICESat-2 ATL08 height_terrain_bestfit data and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation L2A elev_lowestmode data from the global perspectives. The predicted elevations exhibit a high correlation with the measured elevations from the two airborne LiDAR validation regions with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.34 and 0.59 m. The averaged RMSEs of the predicted elevations at different land covers are 1.26 and 1.18 m when compared with those derived from ATL08 and GEDI L2A, respectively. No remarkable abnormal predicted elevations are observed. This finding suggests the satisfactory robustness performance of the proposed method under different land covers and a relatively good consistency between the predicted elevations and the actual terrain of the entire island. As far as we know, the present work is the first to map elevations at 10 m resolution based only on the newly available satellite active and passive remotely sensed data without any ground truth surveys, manual intervention, and prior knowledge. Different with existing studies for terrain elevation mapping only at single landcovers, the proposed method demonstrates the capability and effectiveness of ICESat-2 for any landforms and landcovers and shows great potential for high-accuracy and high-resolution time-series terrain elevation estimation and updating at regional/national/global scales."

 Accurate detection of changes in buildings is crucial for the understanding of urban development. The growing accessibility of remote sensing imagery has enabled urban scale change detection (CD) in both 2D and 3D. However, existing methods have not yet fully exploited the fusion of feature information in multi-temporal images, resulting in insufficient accuracy in 2D changed regions or in elevation changes. To this end, a Cross-temporal and Spatial Context Learning Network (CSCLNet) aimed at multi-task building CD from dual-temporal optical images is proposed, capturing both 2D and 3D changes simultaneously. It leverages a CNN network to extract multi-layer semantic features. Subsequently, two modules, Cross-temporal Transformer Semantic Enhancement (CTSE) and Multi-layer Feature Fusion (MFF), are developed to refine the feature representations. CTSE enhances temporal information by cross attention of dual-temporal features to enable interactions and MFF fuses multi-layer features and enhances attention to global and local spatial context. Finally, two prediction heads are introduced to separately handle 2D and 3D change prediction, identifying changed building objects and their elevation changes. Experiments conducted with two public datasets, 3DCD and SMARS, show that the CSCLNet achieves state-of-the-art for both 2D and 3D CD tasks. In particular, the change-specific RMSE of elevation changes has been reduced to 4.52 m in real world scenes. The code is available at: https://github.com/Geo3DSmart/CSCLNet."

 Efficient prediction and precise depiction of heavy metal concentrations in urban soil are essential for mitigating non-point source pollution and safeguarding public health. Therefore, this research investigated the estimation of soil heavy metal concentrations derived from Gaofen-5 (GF-5) hyperspectral images calibrated by the direct standardization (DS) algorithm. The inversion strategy for soil heavy metal concentrations in response to the two-dimensional soil spectral index (2D-SSI) was proposed by coupling Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and competitive adaptive reweighting algorithm (CARS) for feature selection.

 Plastic greenhouses (PGs) are integral to modern agricultural practices, enhancing crop yields but also raising environmental concerns. Consequently, comprehending their widespread distribution is essential. Although deep learning has been extensively used for land use/cover classification and extraction with satellite data, the large number of labels limits its application due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual labeling. This study introduces a novel approach coupling Prior Knowledge and Deep Learning methods for PG Mapping (PGMPK+DL) using Sentinel-1/2 data. We use an automatic labeling strategy guided by prior knowledge from Sentinel-2 optical data to construct PG labels in six small regions. Moreover, to overcome the cloud contamination issue of optical data, the potential of Sentinel-1 time-series SAR data for PG extraction is analyzed. Deep learning methods are further utilized to capture more abstract and generalized temporal and spatial features from time-series radar data to accommodate complex scenes for large-scale PG extraction. The U-Net model emerges as superior from rigorous comparisons among FCN, SegNet, U-Net, DeepLabV3 + and U-Net3 + deep learning models. Finally, the U-Net model harnessed prior knowledge-based PG labels and Sentinel-1 time-series SAR data to generate a precise map depicting PG distribution across Shandong province, China. Remarkably, it accurately identifies approximately 238,000 ha of PG areas. This PGMPK+DL approach presents a groundbreaking solution for label construction, enabling the achievement of large-scale PG extraction.

 Chlorophyll is both a cornerstone of plant photosynthesis and an important indicator for assessing crop growth and health. Although many previous studies have explored the use of remote sensing to retrieve chlorophyll content, there is room for improvement in the proposed retrieval models, especially the hybrid model, and its performance in combination with multi-angle remote sensing remains unknown. To this end, we developed a hybrid chlorophyll retrieval model by coupling PROSAIL, Gaussian process regression, and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based on multi-angle (−60° to 60°) hyperspectral observations of maize. The CWT converts PROSAIL-modeled and measured spectral reflectance into wavelet features (WF) that finely capture signals due to chlorophyll changes, making WF-based hybrid models (HMWF) promising for enhanced chlorophyll retrieval. Our results show that for leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) retrieval, combining low and medium scale WFs (scales3-5) with hybrid models is more advantageous than using other scale WFs. The accuracy of the HMWF based on the best-scale WF was significantly higher than that of the hybrid model based on original spectrum or vegetation indices. Additionally, our evaluation of the effect of viewing zenith angles (VZAs) on HMWF showed that the accuracies of HMWF acquired at non-nadir angles were generally higher than those acquired at nadir angle. Among all models, the HMWF based on the scale3 WF had the highest accuracy at −10°, with R2 = 0.85 and RMSE=3.55 for LCC retrievals, and R2 = 0.78 and RMSE=0.22 for CCC retrievals. Furthermore, the HMWF showed the least sensitivity to changes in VZAs, especially in the range of −10° to −40°.

 Accurate estimation of crown fire potential (CFP) can improve guidance on crown fire control and management. However, robust simulations of crown fire behavior are still challenging, limiting the accuracy of regional-scale CFP mapping. This study aims to incorporate fire spread simulation and machine learning algorithms to improve CFP mapping at a regional scale. First, we built a crown fire dataset using the fire simulations from the FARSITE model, as well as multi-source data, including fuel, weather, and topography variables. Fuel model parameters were optimized with four metaheuristic algorithms for robust fire simulations. Then, the hybrid models of CFP estimation (TBA-ML) were established by coupling with the transfer AdaBoost (TrAdaBoost) algorithm and three machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., Bayesian Network (BN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to estimate CFP for crown fire danger assessment spatially. Results showed that the TBA-BN model performed best in estimating CFP with higher accuracy (AUC>0.9 and F1 score > 0.8) than the RF- and SVM-based CFP models. The variable importance and causal analysis showed that fuel and topography variables have major contributions to crown fire occurrence. Finally, we mapped monthly average passive and active CFP at regional scales and qualitatively demonstrated that our CFP time-series products successfully captured the dynamic change of crown fire danger. The above results suggest the potential of integrating fire spread simulation and machine learning algorithms to accurately estimate CFP to improve crown fire management."

 The production of wild fish has remained relatively stable in the last two decades, whereas aquaculture organism production has increased to the point where it has exceeded wild catches. In this context, accurate and up-to-date information about the current usage of marine areas for aquaculture is crucial for the planning of marine activities. However, this data is often limited to national authorities, and discrepancies between planned and real practices can arise in available data. In this study, a novel methodology to automatically map and verify the current activity of aquaculture crops across European regions based on freely available satellite data is proposed. The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Sentinel-1 mission provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, which serve as the basis for the analysis. Multiple SAR images of the same locations are processed using ESA Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software and merged to remove temporal noise-like artifacts caused by factors such as ships and waves. Next, the iDPolRAD algorithm is employed to detect potential aquaculture sites, which initially include noise from coastal zones and unwanted human and natural structures that pass through the filter. The aquaculture sites are classified using a ResNet18 model with 93% of the sites correctly classified. This implies that it is feasible to monitor marine areas using satellite radar data to track aquaculture areas. However, generalization power across regions is poor likely due to the diversity of types of structures used and species cultivated. Further studies are needed to investigate factors influencing the detectability of different aquaculture sites such as cage geometry or SAR image resolution in order to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the mapping process. This study highlights the potential of SAR data, coupled with image processing and classification techniques, as a viable means to map large marine areas dedicated to aquaculture."

 Rapid generation of tree models from point clouds of tree canopies holds wide-ranging applications in the field of earth sciences, including forest ecology research, environmental monitoring, and forest management. Traditional tree modeling methods rely on procedural models to simulate tree growth, which are time-consuming due to their extensive manual parameterization. Furthermore, existing deep learning methods struggle to generate visually realistic tree models because of the complex branch structures and specific natural patterns of trees. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based method for rapidly generating tree models that align with the shape of the tree canopy. Different from traditional methods, we use deep neural networks to build branch graphs for generating tree models. Our method consists of two main steps: i) the 3D coordinates of each tree node are generated from the canopy point cloud by the designed node coordinate generation network; ii) a graph neural network is proposed to predict node attributes and the adjacency relationship between nodes. To form the tree structure, the discrete nodes are connected by using the minimum spanning tree algorithm combined with the adjacency relationship. The attributes of the node include width, whether it is a leaf node, and leaf node size, which are used for subsequent construction of the tree’s mesh. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, a large-scale dataset containing 10 forests with 3216 tree canopies is constructed and open sourced for the study of generating tree models from point clouds of tree canopies. Experimental results demonstrate our method’s efficiency in generating tree models quickly (reducing the average canopy-to-tree reconstruction time from 7 min to less than 0.5 s) while preserving visual authenticity and accurately matching tree canopy shapes, making it suitable for a wide range of forest reconstructions."

 As global land cover/ land use change (LULCC) threatens the human’s well-being, accurate detection and characterization of LULCC is of paramount importance. The increasing availability of dense satellite image time series (SITS), together with the ever-improving change detection algorithms, has allowed significant progress to be made. However, much remains to be done in its characterization.This study aims to uncover potential relationships between changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) SITS patterns and their drivers. It distinguishes itself by representing phenological changes not only as transitions between specific patterns, but also by examining the nature of these changes—whether abrupt, gradual, or seasonal. For seasonal changes, it further refines the analysis to determine their impact on the amplitude, number of seasons (NOS), or length of seasons (LOS) components. Our focus is to provide insights into the land dynamics and drivers of change in Senegal using an RGB (red, green, blue) composite change map. This map is derived from three MODIS NDVI time series change metrics detected by BFASTm-L2 within the MODIS NDVI 2000–2021 SITS: magnitude of change, direction of change, and dissimilarity of time series shape. The 250-meter resolution MODIS data served as an optimal data source for this analysis due to its high temporal resolution (near daily) and extensive coverage over 20 years.The sensitivity of each metric to different types of change was first tested on a simulated dataset before being applied to the MODIS SITS. The RGB change map enabled visualization of different “signatures” of change, which, combined with ground information, rainfall data, NDVI time series analysis, and Google Earth imagery, helped link these signatures to various drivers of change. Climatic and anthropogenic changes, such as those induced by Large Scale Agricultural Investments (LSAI) or mining, were visually inferred from the RGB map.This approach demonstrates the usefulness of integrating the type of change, especially seasonal change, into the characterization of land change. This method has the advantage of being fast, interpretable, robust to noise and easily transferable to different regions."

 A timing and precise diagnosis of crop nutrient status is essential for optimizing management practices that promote environmentally friendly and enhanced crop yields. Although plant tissue analysis has conventionally been employed to evaluate the nutritional status of crops, this method cannot capture the spatial variability of crop nutrients. In contrast, satellite-based remote sensing can monitor the nutrient status of crops across expansive areas. This study explored the capability of multi-source satellite images (PlanetScope-4: 3 m, 4 bands; PlanetScope-8: 3 m, 8 bands; Sentinel-2: 10–60 m, 13 bands; PRISMA: 30 m, 239 bands) in mapping 12 foliar nutrients in cranberries. Three machine learning approaches, including partial least squared regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), were used to relate foliar nutrients to different types of satellite-derived features (SR: surface reflectance; VI: vegetation indices; TF: texture features) or their combinations (SR+VI, VI+TF and SR+VI+TF). Model performance was compared across different foliar nutrients, modelling approaches and combinations of model input features using R2 (the coefficient of determination) and RRMSE (relative root mean square error, = root mean square error/nutrient range × 100 %). Input features that were important to foliar nutrient modelling were identified. The model performance difference among nutrients was consistent between Planet-4 and Sentinel-2, as well as between Planet-8 and PRISMA. In the Planet-4 and Sentinel-2 derived models, N was best predicted (average R2 = 0.77, average RRMSE=15 %), followed by macronutrients S (0.60–0.63, 11 %), Mg (0.58–0.65, 10–11 %), Ca (0.49–0.51, 9 %), Na (0.69, 22 %), P (0.49, 9 %) and K (0.20, 8 %), and then by all micronutrients(i.e., Fe, Mn, B, Cu and Zn: R2 = 0.04–0.61; RRMSE=16–28 %). In the Planet-8 and PRISMA derived models, macronutrients (i.e., N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S and Na) had lower R2 and RRMSE (R2 = 0.06–0.59; RRMSE=7–57 %) than micronutrients (i.e., Fe, Mn, B, Cu and Zn: R2 = 0.18–0.60; RRMSE=19–66 %). The successful retrieval of foliar nutrients from satellite imagery was influenced by many factors, including the intercorrelation between nutrients and model input features, the data availability at critical growth stages, and satellite images characteristics (e.g., spatial and spectral resolutions). Except for foliar nitrogen, foliar nutrients typically do not exhibit distinct absorption features associated with C, H, N, or O molecular bonds in the 400–2500 nm range. Our results indicate that their successful retrieval can be primarily attributed to the association between foliar nutrients and other leaf components (e.g., pigments, water, and dry matter) that do display spectral features within this range. Our study demonstrated the potential of integrating multi-source satellite data for precise nutrient monitoring over large scales."

 High-throughput phenotypic analysis plays an increasingly important role in crop breeding. In such research, the breeder usually establishes hundreds to thousands of plots, with each plot having its independent genetic breeding sources. The breeding plot extraction of genetic sources is usually outlined manually on RGB UAV imagery, which is time-consuming and subject to human bias. Therefore, a rapid method to extract the breeding plot for each genetic source in high-throughput phenotypic analysis would be very significant. In this paper, we propose a transferable method for extracting breeding plots from UAV RGB imagery. We utilized the fully convolutional neural network model A-UNet with an attention gate. After obtaining binary raster data from deep learning, we introduced post-processing. Subsequently, the raster data after post-processing were converted to vector data to obtain geographical coordinates. Finally, the UAV imagery was masked by the vector data to obtain the extraction results for each plot. The results showed that A-UNet achieved accuracies of over 90 % in precision, recall, and F1 score. Post-processing resulted in a 93 % average IoU in breeding plot extraction in the main study area. The average IOU achieved over 86 % in different spatial resolutions (1.6 cm and 0.4 cm), plot sizes (1 m × 1.5 and 2 m × 5 m), and crop types (rice). In summary, this study developed a method for extracting breeding plots in high-throughput phenotype analysis, which would help to be used as a high-throughput screening technique for accelerating crop breeding."

 The point-based 3D object detection method is highly advantageous due to its lightweight nature and fast inference speed, making it a valuable asset in engineering fields such as intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. However, current advanced methods solely focus on learning features from the provided point cloud, neglecting the active role of unoccupied space. This results in the problem of discontinuous receptive field (DRF), leading to the loss of semantic and geometric information of the objects. To address this issue, we propose a new end-to-end single-stage point-based model, DRF-SSD, in this paper. DRF-SSD utilizes a PointNet++-style 3D backbone to maintain fast inference capability. Then, point-wise features are projected onto a plane in the Neck structure, and local and global information are aggregated through the designed Hierarchical Encoding–Decoding (HED) and Hybrid Transformer (HT) modules. The former fills in features for unoccupied space through convolutional layers, enhancing local features by interacting with features in occupied space during the learning process. The latter further expands the receptive field using the global learning ability of transformers. The spatial transformation and learning processes in HED and HT only involve key points, and HED is designed to have a special structure that maintains the sparsity of feature maps, preserving the efficiency of the model’s inference. Finally, query features are back-projected onto points for feature enhancement and input into the detection head for prediction. Extensive experiments on the KITTI datasets demonstrate that DRF-SSD achieves superior detection accuracy compared to previous methods, with significant improvements. Specifically, the approach obtains 2.25%, 0.66%, and 0.42% improvement for the metric of 3D Average Precision (AP3D) under the easy, moderate, and hard settings, respectively. Additionally, the method enables other point-based detectors to achieve substantial gains, demonstrating its effectiveness.

 Accurate and non-destructive estimation of leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is crucial for optimizing cotton production. This study enhances the SCOPE model by integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-derived multispectral data with leaf area index (LAI) from LiDAR data, significantly improving precision of LCC estimation, particularly during crucial growth stages of cotton. We construct and analyze three cost functions: COST1, which relies solely on spectral data; COST2, which incorporates direct LAI inputs; and COST3, which adjusts for LAI measurement uncertainties by combining spectral term with an error term representing the squared relative error between measured and model-estimated LAI. Our findings indicate that while COST1 establishes a baseline, COST2 and COST3 provide more accurate LCC estimations. COST3, validated against theoretical data, field-measured cotton datasets, and an additional maize dataset, proves most robust, maintaining consistent accuracy across all growth stages especially when considering input data uncertainties. This highlights the importance of integrating appropriate forms of LAI in cost functions to refine LCC estimation. Future research should focus on improving data acquisition quality and developing more advanced cost functions to advance LCC estimation further."

 Treatment of land-to-ocean leakage is crucial in modeling the mass-term sea level (MSL) using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite gravity measurements. In this study, we utilized the Spherical Slepian functions (SSFs) to determine MSL variations in the South China Sea. A sensitivity simulation in terms of trend, annual amplitude, and phase revealed that the SSF solution with a 1° coastal buffer zone provides a better land-to-ocean leakage correction than traditionally used Spherical Harmonics (SH). It was also found that an additional smoothing procedure for SSF with low concentrating energy could significantly reduce the high-frequency noise in GRACE (e.g., the north–south strips). The spatiotemporal characteristics of the true MSL were further compared among GRACE SH and Mascon solutions, model-predicted ocean bottom pressure, and steric-corrected altimetric data (i.e., satellite-altimetric sea level minus steric effect). Results revealed that despite the SSF-inverted regional MSL solution being generally similar to other results, this technique notably recovered the realistic magnitude of detailed features. The apparent MSL signal was, for instance, precisely recovered in the central part of the Gulf of Thailand and the Sunda Shelf by the SSF, while the SH significantly underestimated it due to smoothing. In addition to the seasonality, the interannual signal decomposed from the SSF-inverted residual MSL (by removing the trend and periodic signals) was the strongest and well cross-correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index. With more detailed spatial patterns revealed by MSL from GRACE SSF, our findings demonstrate that SSF is more suitable for regional-scale studies."

 Campi Flegrei caldera is an Italian high-risk volcano experiencing a progressively more intense long-term uplift, accompanied by increasing seismicity and geochemical emissions over the last two decades. Ground deformation shows an axisymmetric bell-shaped pattern, with a maximum uplift of about 120 cm, from 2005, in the caldera central area. We analyzed Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed Multi-Temporal DInSAR measurements and GNSS data to reveal and investigate a geodetic anomaly that has clearly manifested since 2021, locally deviating from the typical bell-shaped deformation pattern. This anomaly is located east of Pozzuoli town, in the Mt. Olibano–Accademia area, covers an area of about 1.3 km2 and shows, in comparison to surrounding areas, a maximum uplift deficit of about 9 cm between 2021 and 2023. To investigate the anomaly causes, we analyzed the caldera seismicity and inverted the DInSAR data to determine the primary source of the ground deformation pattern, which is consistent with a penny-shaped source located approximately 3800 m beneath the Pozzuoli town, with a radius of about 1200 m. We also found that the time evolution of the uplift deficit in the geodetic anomaly area correlates well with the earthquake occurrence, with the greater magnitude events clustering in this area. These considerations suggest the geodetic anomaly is a local response to the tensile stress regime produced by the inflating primary deformation source. This phenomenon can be influenced by the Mt. Olibano–Accademia lava domes lithological heterogeneities that may induce a localized reaction to ground deformation during the inflationary phase. Our interpretation aligns with the concentration of earthquakes and hydrothermal fluid emissions in this area, indicating the presence of faults, fractures, and fluid circulation. Accordingly, the geodetic anomaly area represents a zone of crustal weakness that requires careful monitoring and study."

 Human health is directly impacted by trace components found in soil, for which hyperspectral remote sensing technology offers a novel way to rapidly assess dynamic soil environmental quality. In most studies, the premise of quantitative inversion on soil elements is that the known target elements will cause growth stress. However, such stress is unusual in non-polluted areas. Consequently, broad-area soil trace element monitoring in non-contaminated areas remains challenging. Spectral inversion of plant material has a longer time window and is more sensitive to elemental changes than soil spectral inversion (bare soil period). In this work, we conducted a wheat pot experiment with concentration gradients of four trace elements (Fe, B, Mo, and Zn), analyzed leaf (jointing stage) and spike (maturity period) samples using spectral measurements and chemical tests, and filtered the characteristic positions and inverse modeling using the spectra of the element-accumulating preference organs in plant canopies. The canopy aggregation sites differed for each element, and both simple linear regression (SLR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models based on the spectra of canopy aggregation sites achieved high accuracy. The results of this study enable the construction of an inverse model of plant spectra-plant element content-elements in soil, which can serve as a reference for soil monitoring and assessment in typical crop cover areas."

 Under the dual pressures of rapid urbanization and global warming, the management of solar radiation has become an urgent issue to address. In this context, the potential regulatory role of urban street networks on solar radiation has garnered widespread attention. However, existing research lacks an understanding of the impact of street direction. By utilising street view data and solar trajectory simulation technology, it becomes possible to facilitate the revelation of spatiotemporal differences in solar radiation across streets with different direction. The results show that solar radiation is generally lower on north–south streets than on east–west streets. In terms of spatial differences, the average solar radiation in the fifth ring of Beijing is 25.38% higher than that in the second ring. Temporally, the average solar radiation in August, the highest month, is 15.98% greater than in October, the lowest month. Additionally, solar radiation on east–west street direction shows more intense variations in summer. A periodic variation in solar radiation was also discovered in relation to street angles, with different frequencies and amplitudes at 30° and 180°.

 Wetland system is one of the most important ecosystems on the earth’s surface. It is significant important to monitor wetland ecosystem using remote sensing technology. However, the complexity, fuzziness, and spatial heterogeneity of wetlands increase the difficulty of wetland classification, leading to the problem that the classification accuracy is not high enough to satisfy the needs of in-depth research. At present, the classification of wetlands is mainly based on pixel based- and image object based- methods. Addressing the problems of traditional pixel based- and image object based- methods, this study proposes to utilize fuzzy geospatial objects to express wetland objects. By synthesizing the spectral features, shape features, texture features, fuzziness and other features of wetland objects, a hierarchical classification method based on fuzzy geospatial objects is proposed. Taking Tianjin Binhai New Area as the study area, Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing images are utilized for verification. The main contents of this study and its results are as follows: (1) Extract the fuzzy geospatial objects of wetlands and construct the classification feature sets. (2) To simplify the classification problem, a hierarchical classification framework based on optimizing multiple attributes using Random Forest is proposed. By this method, the problems of difficulty in distinguishing wetlands and low classification accuracy caused by similarity of spectral features of wetland objects in the traditional single layer classification method are solved. Three experiments are designed in the study to verify the effects of the fuzzy geospatial objects of wetlands and the hierarchical classification method on the classification accuracy of wetlands, respectively. The results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the proposed hierarchical wetland classification method based on fuzzy geospatial objects are 94.35% and 0.899, respectively, which are 12.35% and 0.183 higher than those of the traditional image object based- methods."

 Lunar lava tube caves, due to their unique geographical structure and potential as shelters, have repeatedly emerged as prime candidates or priority areas during discussions on lunar base site selection. However, owing to current technological limitations and the complexities of lunar exploration, obtaining detailed data directly from the interiors of lunar lava tubes poses a significant challenge. Hence, the study of terrestrial lava tubes assumes critical importance. By delving into Earth’s lava tubes, we can gain insights into crucial aspects such as their formation mechanisms, geological characteristics, and stability, which can then inform and guide research on lava tubes found on extraterrestrial bodies like the Moon and Mars. During the data acquisition process for lava tubes, given their intricate spatial configurations and dim lighting conditions, we have opted to employ LiDAR technology to collect point cloud data, revealing the internal structural information of the lava tubes. Consequently, this paper thoroughly explores a method for extracting lava tube parameters and constructing models using this point cloud data. This approach encompasses four key steps: data preprocessing, axis construction of the lava tube, cross-sectional feature extraction, and 3D model reconstruction. Initially, raw data is refined through the creation of point cloud voxels to mitigate noise interference. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm is utilized to obtain the L1-medial skeleton, enabling precise capture of the lava tube’s axis information. Using this extracted axis, we proceed with sampling at fixed intervals to derive cross-sectional points of the lava tube. These points are then utilized to extract fundamental geometric parameters such as cross-sectional area, length, and width. Ultimately, by integrating all these cross-sectional point cloud data, a comprehensive 3D model of the lava tube is constructed. Remarkably, this method achieves a high degree of accuracy, with 99 % of the extracted cross-sectional points exhibiting an error of less than 0.12 m, and 99 % of the model’s positional errors falling within 0.15 m. This not only enhances the precision of parameter extraction but also provides significant technical support for in-depth studies of extraterrestrial volcanic activities and lava tube formation mechanisms. Furthermore, it offers a valuable tool for parameter extraction and research on other irregular natural tunnels."

 Due to its advantages of high spatiotemporal resolution, long-term stable observation, and historical retrospective data, satellite remote sensing has extensive application in the dynamic monitoring of water quality in coastal and inland waters. However, constructing generic satellite inversion models for water quality indicators, especially non-optically active parameters such as nutrients, remains challenging due to the varying pollution sources in different inland waters. This study aims to address this challenge from a data-driven perspective. Based on Sentinel-2 satellite images and in situ data from 311 automatic monitoring stations in Zhejiang Province, China, a large volume of matchups between satellite-derived water spectra and in situ water quality parameter concentrations were constructed, including the permanganate index (CODMn, N=8760, from 0.08 to 9.88 mg/L), total nitrogen (TN, N=7434, from 0.01 to 9.30 mg/L), total phosphorus (TP, N=8845, from 0.001 to 0.991 mg/L), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N, N=8642, from 0.001 to 1.980 mg/L) and water turbidity (TUB, N=7913, from 0.1 to 1994 NTU). Satellite retrieval models for the five water quality parameters were constructed utilizing the extreme gradient boosting tree algorithm (XGBoost), which can be applied to diverse inland waters. The models showed robust performance on the additional independent dataset, with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.74, 0.79, 0.84, 0.72, and 0.87, and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.73 mg/L, 0.56 mg/L, 0.18 mg/L, 0.24 mg/L, and 0.29 NTU for CODMn, TN, TP, NH3-N, and TUB, respectively. Comparisons between satellite-retrieved and in situ values showed good consistency in both spatial and temporal distributions. By applying these models to inland waters in Zhejiang Province, the monthly distributions of major rivers and reservoirs with a 10 m resolution for the five water quality parameters were obtained. The patterns of the five water quality parameters across the rivers typically indicated elevated values in the downstream regions and diminished values in the upstream areas, except for those of the Yongjiang River and Cao’e River. Compared to rivers, reservoirs had good water quality. However, for some water quality parameters, the temporal variations in the average values over the whole reservoir and the values at specific sites had opposite trends. Our research provides a practical reference for the construction of satellite retrieval models for determining the water quality parameters of inland waters, as well as robust technical support for dynamic remote sensing surveillance of inland water quality."

 Protected areas play a crucial role in safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, they face mounting challenges from environmental pressures. This study examines the Oshtorankooh Protected Area (OPA) in Iran, evaluating its vulnerability to various environmental hazards from 2010 to 2020.A comprehensive set of variables, including physiographic, climatic, geological, edaphic, vegetative, hydrological, and socio-economic factors, were utilized to compute 45 vulnerability indicators across three dimensions: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for 2010 and 2020. Maps of these indicators were created and standardized, with weights assigned using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). Composite indices for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity were then developed by integrating these weighted and standardized maps.The vulnerability indices for grid cells within the OPA enabled the identification of spatial vulnerability patterns, highlighting heightened vulnerability in the northern and western sectors influenced by factors such as drought variability, social vulnerability, evapotranspiration rates, spring discharge, and runoff dynamics. Results indicate a notable increase in vulnerability over the study period, with index values rising from 0.76 in 2010 to 2.04 in 2020.

 Semantic segmentation is key in analyzing urban mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds. In recent years, the Transformer mechanism, known for capturing long-range contextual relationships, has attracted significant research attention in the field of 3D vision. However, computing global self-attention for 3D scenes incurs high computational costs and the loss of local details. Our work introduces a Dual Domain Transformer network (D2T-Net), adept at processing complex urban MLS point clouds. It operates efficiently in spatial and channel dimensions, enabling efficient semantic segmentation while maintaining detailed scene elements like small urban objects. We introduce a Local Spatial-wise Transformer (LST) block to enrich local semantics through an improved self-attention mechanism that incorporates relative embeddings and transfers spatial information across various representation subspaces in parallel. Based on a feature pyramid framework that fuses and refines features from LST, we introduce a Global Channel-wise Transformer (GCT) block, which efficiently captures global context by focusing on feature channel inter-relationships with a controlled flow gate employed for selective information transfer. D2T-Net utilizes Transformers in both spatial and channel domains to review and fuse features from multiple layers, effectively summarizing semantic contexts and enriching spatial details with multi-scale information. Experiments conducted on three challenging benchmark MLS datasets, the Oakland 3-D, Toronto-3D, and Paris-Lille-3D have confirmed D2T-Net’s accuracy, achieving 98.2%, 83.9%, and 83.8% mIoU respectively."

 Rapeseed cultivation on winter-fallow fields enables a seasonal switch between agricultural and bioenergy output. In view of the spectral features during the rapeseed flowering period (RFP), numerous remote sensing studies identified and produced the maps of rapeseed fields. The RFP is frequently identified by field surveys, visual imagery interpretation, or empirical crop knowledge in a specific region, none of which is appropriate for large-scale rapeseed identification and mapping. In this research, we combine social media data on the RFP fields, Sentinel-2 imagery, and deep learning algorithm to identify and produce maps of yellow-flowering rapeseed fields.

 Deep learning is widely applied in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target recognition. However, the high cost of collecting real SAR target data leads to insufficient data volume and diversity of SAR target datasets, making it challenging to support deep learning models. Therefore, it is necessary to expand SAR target datasets through data generation. However, existing SAR target data generation methods do not fully utilize the SAR imaging geometric information of targets. This results in generating image data that does not conform to SAR physical imaging laws. To address this problem, this paper proposes a SAR vehicle data generation method that integrates deep imaging geometric information. Compared to SAR, optical data, which contains rich geometric structural information of targets, is relatively easy to collect. Therefore, the proposed method computes the dominant scattering edge (DSE) of targets under different radar incident angles with optical data. Then, based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), a SAR vehicle target data generation model is constructed. To guide the model in learning SAR imaging geometric laws of targets, the computed DSE is integrated into the generation network with multi-scale attention mechanism modules. Compared to existing SAR target data generation methods, our proposed method can generate SAR vehicle target data with distinct dominant scattering edges, and effectively addresses the issue of generated target data not conforming to SAR imaging physical laws. Metrics such as Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), scattering intensity difference, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) are adopted for evaluation. The SSIM between the generated and the real SAR target data reaches 0.834, the FID minimum of 96.98, and the scattering intensity difference minimum of 0.37 dB, all indicating that the SAR target data generated by the proposed method is similar to real ones in terms of deep feature, scattering intensity, and image structure. Finally, the SAR target data generated by the proposed method is verified through target recognition experiments with VGG16 and ResNet50 as backbone network. The average recognition accuracy increases by 2.80% and 2.14%, respectively. The target recognition results demonstrate that the generated SAR data can help improve target recognition accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of data generated by the proposed method."

 Human visual attention is the basis of target recognition, change detection and classification in remote sensing images. However, the human visual attention of remote sensing images during target detection remains uninvestigated. In this study, we simultaneously collected eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) data of 40 experts during target detection in 1000 remote sensing images. We quantified their attention in different phases of target detection (i.e., target search, selection, and identification) from their eye movements and brain activities. The eye-tracking results indicated that hue and lightness were crucial visual features that guided visual search for remote sensing images. The size of the target also affected the allocation of human attention resources. Particularly, participants tended to miss the targets that were smaller than 3.9 % of the whole image area. The fixation event-related potentials (FRPs) in temporal and parietal brain regions further distinguished the attention of targets and distractors, which could be attributed to the process of memory and processing. Our findings offer new visual and neural evidence for human attention in target detection of remote sensing images, which not only contribute to the performance of attention-based algorithms in remote sensing interpretation, but also provide an empirical basis for guiding human–machine intelligent fusion."

 Ocean loading deformation is one of the key processes in geodesy, geophysics, and Isostasy, and is also important for assessment of future coastal environmental changes. Traditionally, the ocean tide loading has been considered the only contributor to the ocean loading deformation by most previous InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) studies. In this study, we quantify the non-tidal ocean loading deformation using the multi-temporal InSAR-derived deformation data from the Chaoshan coast in southern China and explore its driving mechanisms. Our results show that InSAR deformation anomalies in the Chaoshan coastal area exhibit a distinct deformation gradient from the coast to inland. A strong scale- and direction-dependent pattern in InSAR data, with significant seasonality, is unveiled by the second-order spatial structure function. To explore the driving mechanism behind this deformation, we conduct a correlation analysis between spatial pattern of land deformation and sea level changes. The results indicate that ocean loading is the predominant driving factor behind the Chaoshan coastal deformation. Analysis using the MERRA2 model demonstrates that terrestrial water storage loading deformation is negligible in comparison. Furthermore, by applying the FES2014b tide model, we find that the contributions of the non-tidal and tide-induced ocean loading deformation to the total deformation anomaly are 50–70% and 30–50%, respectively. Lastly, we have uncovered that the non-tidal ocean loading is primarily attributed to the monsoon-induced seasonal sea level changes, with a time lag ranging from one to two months.

 Northern peatland vegetation exhibits fine-scale spatial and spectral heterogeneity that can potentially be captured with uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) data due to their ultra-high spatial resolution (<10 cm).

We conducted random forest (RF) regressions in a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) framework and compared the relative contributions of the different datasets. In the best regression models, the percentage of explained variance was 24–74 % (RMSE:0.24–0.31), 40–90 % (RMSE:0.12–0.41), and 18–90 % (RMSE:0.03–0.40) for plant community clusters, PFTs, and plant species, respectively.

 The tremendous improvement for satellite remote sensing has provided mankind with the feasibility of observing large-scale ocean phenomena from space. Passive remote sensing of ocean color has delivered continuous records of ocean surface information, although there are inherent limitations to this natural light-dependent measurement. The development of spaceborne lidars breaks through the restrictions of passive techniques that are unavailable for obtaining the vertical characteristics of water column, and provides a new approach to the detection of ocean subsurface. In this study, the active spaceborne lidar ICESat-2 and passive optical satellite are fused, to establish an inversion method of lidar equation and semi-analytical model. The diffuse attenuation coefficient (kd) was estimated in various areas of the global oceans, and vertical profiles of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) were further obtained. The results showed that Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of Chla derived by the proposed method with BGC-Argo data were in the range of 0.003–0.14 mg/m3, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was between 12.5 % and 26.9 %; Comparison with ocean color products indicated that R2 of Chla was in the range of 0.84–0.98, and MAE of kd was in the range of 0.004–0.021 m−1. The multiple validation approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of water column profile detection with ICESat-2 lidar and passive satellite, which contributes to the enhanced understanding of ocean subsurface phytoplankton and their spatial or temporal variations."

 With the escalating global climate changes and rapid urbanization, urban flood disasters have become more frequent and severe, hindering progress toward global sustainability goals. The rapid growth of information technology provides abundant data for disaster monitoring, but transitioning from static to dynamic and structured to heterogeneous data poses challenges for organized flood disaster information analysis. This study conducts an in-depth analysis of flood disaster components and spatiotemporal characteristics, exploring qualitative information expression in diverse contexts and quantitative dynamic analysis. Using dimensions like spatiotemporal, semantic, and hierarchical correlations, we introduce a multi-level, multi-dimensional “circumstance-event” model for flood disaster events. Leveraging proximity and semantic relationships, we establish a dynamic semantic association network among geographical units, supporting disaster circumstance division using semantic correlation graphs. Introducing bidirectional relationship discrimination, we enhance the traditional group evolution discovery method to determine the evolution of circumstances in consecutive time windows. Taking the “7·20” heavy rain in Zhengzhou, China as a case study, we observe significant improvement in circumstance division based on semantic correlation graphs, with an average modularity exceeding 0.745. Our bidirectional community evolution method reveals the evolution sequences of circumstances throughout the flood disaster period in Zhengzhou. This approach effectively organizes the entire flood disaster event lifecycle and dynamically analyzes event evolution, offering vital support for comprehensive disaster management."

It remains unclear whether nonhuman primates share this ability. We recorded spontaneous “phee-call” dialogues between pairs of marmoset monkeys. We discovered that marmosets use these calls to vocally label their conspecifics. Moreover, they respond more consistently and correctly to calls that are specifically directed at them. Analysis of calls from multiple monkeys revealed that family members use similar calls and acoustic features to label others and perform vocal learning. These findings shed light on the complexities of social vocalizations among nonhuman primates and suggest that marmoset vocalizations may provide a model for understanding aspects of human language, thereby offering new insights into the evolution of social communication."

Attempts to understand how localized stress leads to widespread repression have been limited by difficulties in resolving translation rates at the subcellular level. Here, using live-cell imaging of reporter mRNA translation, we unexpectedly found that during ER stress, active translation at mitochondria was significantly protected. The mitochondrial protein ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3A (ATAD3A) interacted with protein kinase RNA–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and mediated this effect on localized translation by competing for binding with PERK’s target, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). PERK-ATAD3A interactions increased during ER stress, forming mitochondria-ER contact sites. Furthermore, ATAD3A binding attenuated local PERK signaling and rescued the expression of some mitochondrial proteins. Thus, PERK-ATAD3A interactions can control translational repression at a subcellular level, mitigating the impact of ER stress on the cell."

We found that the autophagic receptor p62/SQSTM1 modulates micronuclear stability, influencing chromosome fragmentation and rearrangements. Mechanistically, proximity of micronuclei to mitochondria led to oxidation-driven homo-oligomerization of p62, limiting endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)–dependent micronuclear envelope repair by triggering autophagic degradation.

ROS retained CHMP7 in micronuclei while disrupting its interaction with other ESCRT-III components.

Although the amplification of excitatory signals by local voltage-dependent cation channels has been extensively studied, their spatiotemporal dynamics in elaborate dendritic branches remain obscure owing to technical limitations. Using fluorescent voltage imaging throughout dendritic arborizations in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we demonstrate a unique chloride ion (Cl−)–dependent remote computation mechanism in the distal branches. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials triggered by local laser photolysis of caged glutamate spread along dendrites, with gradual amplification toward the distal end while attenuation toward the soma. Tour de force subcellular patch-clamp recordings from thin branches complemented by biophysical model simulations revealed that the asymmetric augmentation of excitation relies on tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium ion (Na+) channels and Cl−conductance accompanied by a more hyperpolarized dendritic resting potential. Together, this study reveals the cooperative voltage-dependent actions of cation and anion conductance for dendritic supralinear computation, which can locally decode the spatiotemporal context of synaptic inputs."

How such inputs affect retinal processing has remained unknown. We confirmed brain-to-retina projections of histaminergic neurons from the mouse hypothalamus. Histamine application ex vivo altered the activity of various retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), including direction-selective RGCs that gained responses to high motion velocities. These results were reproduced in vivo with optic tract recordings where histaminergic retinopetal axons were activated chemogenetically. Such changes could improve vision of fast-moving objects (e.g., while running), which fits with the known increased activity of histaminergic neurons during arousal. An antihistamine drug reduced optomotor responses to high-speed moving stimuli in freely moving mice. In humans, the same antihistamine nonuniformly modulated visual sensitivity across the visual field, indicating an evolutionary conserved function of the histaminergic system. Our findings expose a previously unappreciated role for brain-to-retina projections in modulating retinal function."

Unraveling the complex mechanisms governing chilling tolerance in rice is crucial for molecular breeding of cold-tolerant varieties. Here, we identify an APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factor, OsERF52, as a positive modulator in response to low temperatures. OsERF52 directly regulates the expression ofC-Repeat Binding Factor(CBF) genes in rice. In addition, Osmotic Stress/ABA-Activated Protein Kinase 9–mediated phosphorylation of OsERF52 at S261 enhances its stability and interaction with Ideal Plant Architecture 1 and OsbHLH002/OsICE1. This collaborative activation leads to the expression ofOsCBFs, thereby initiating the chilling response in rice. Notably, plants with base-editedOsERF52S261D-3HAexhibit enhanced chilling resistance without yield penalty.

Despite over 30 years of numerous computational studies on magnetorotational turbulence, the properties of fluctuations in the inertial range—where cross-scale energy transfer dominates over energy injection—have remained elusive, primarily due to insufficient numerical resolution. Here, we report the highest-resolution simulation of magnetorotational turbulence ever conducted. Our simulations reveal a constant cross-scale energy flux, a hallmark of the inertial range. We found that as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales in the inertial range, the kinetic and magnetic energies tend toward equipartitioning with the same spectral slope, and slow magnetosonic fluctuations dominate over Alfvénic fluctuations, having twice the energy. These findings align remarkably with the theoretical expectations from the reduced magnetohydrodynamic model, which assumes a near-azimuthal mean magnetic field.

The molecular mechanism by which de novo DNA methyltransferase(s) [DNMT(s)] catalyze CpG methylation at PRC-regulated regions remains unclear. Here, we report a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the DNMT3A long isoform (DNMT3A1) amino-terminal region in complex with a nucleosome carrying PRC1-mediated histone H2A lysine-119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119Ub). We identify regions within the DNMT3A1 amino terminus that bind H2AK119Ub and the nucleosome acidic patch. This bidentate interaction is required for effective DNMT3A1 engagement with H2AK119Ub-modified chromatin in cells. Further, aberrant redistribution of DNMT3A1 to Polycomb target genes recapitulates the cancer-associated DNA hypermethylation signature and inhibits their transcriptional activation during cell differentiation. This effect is rescued by disruption of the DNMT3A1–acidic patch interaction. Together, our analyses reveal a binding interface critical for mediating promoter CpG island DNA hypermethylation, a major molecular hallmark of cancer."

Our research focused on unraveling the mechanisms governing the specification of these two distinct cell fates following the stem cell division. For this purpose, we used the model organismPhyscomitrium patens, which features a singular pluripotent stem cell known as the gametophore apical cell. We show that the activity of cytokinins, critical stem cell regulators, is restricted to the gametophore apical cell due to the specific localization of PpLOG, the enzyme responsible for cytokinin activation. In turn, PpTAW, which promotes differentiating cell identity of the merophyte, is excluded from the gametophore apical cell by the action of cytokinins. We propose a cytokinin-based model for the establishment of asymmetry in the pluripotent stem cell division."

To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs."

However, a recent study reported the existence ofmrc1+microglia in zebrafish embryos, which are seemingly independent of Pu.1 and reliant on lymphatic vessels, sparking great interest in the possibility of lymphatic-originated microglia. To address this, we took advantage of apu.1knock-in zebrafish allele for a detailed investigation. Our results conclusively showed that almost all zebrafish embryonic microglia (~95% on average) expresspu.1.

Further investigation suggests that TaWAK2 directly interacts with and phosphorylates TaNAL1, a trypsin-like serine/cysteine protease. The phosphorylated TaNAL1 is then involved in the degradation of the zinc finger transcription factor TaDST, which acts as a repressor of leaf expansion by activating the expression of the cytokinin oxidase geneTaCKX9and triggering in vivo cytokinin degradation. Therefore, our findings elucidate a signaling cascade involving TaWAK2-TaNAL1-TaDST that sheds light on the regulation of wheat leaf development."

Here, we identify the inaugural noncanonical strigolactone, 4-oxo-methyl carlactonoate (4-oxo-MeCLA), in rice root exudate. Comprehensive, cross-species coexpression analysis allowed us to identify a cytochrome P450, OsCYP706C2, and two methyl transferases as candidate enzymes for this noncanonical rice strigolactone biosynthetic pathway. Heterologous expression in yeast andNicotiana benthamianaindeed demonstrated the role of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of 4-oxo-MeCLA, which, expectedly, is derived from carlactone as substrate.

To support rapid clinical translation, a continuous microfluidic preparation for HormFoam was proposed, including the power unit of perfluorocarbon nanodroplets and the pharmaceutical components Pluronic F127–functionalized liposomal insulin and pramlintide. We found that HormFoam could consistently generate foams to drive drugs forward after rectal administration, which enhanced intestinal distribution and mucosa absorption, leading to systemic codelivery of insulin-pramlintide.

Here, we demonstrate that developmental DNA demethylation, driven by ten-eleven translocation 1/2/3 (TET1/2/3) enzymes, is essential for establishment of neural stem cell (NSC) identity and gliogenic potential. We find that loss of all three TETs during NSC specification is dispensable for neural induction and neuronal differentiation but critical for astrocyte and oligodendrocyte formation, demonstrating a selective loss of glial competence. Mechanistically, TET-mediated demethylation was essential for commissioning neural-specific enhancers in proximity to master neurodevelopmental and glial transcription factor genes and for induction of these genes. Consistently, loss of all three TETs in embryonic NSCs in mice compromised glial gene expression and corticogenesis. Thus, TET-dependent developmental demethylation is an essential regulatory mechanism for neural enhancer commissioning during NSC specification and is a cell-intrinsic determinant of NSC identity and gliogenic potential."

However, the effects of land surface model resolution on fluxes and soil state variables in the Arctic have never been systematically studied, even though smaller scale heterogeneities are resolved in high-resolution land boundary condition datasets. Here, we compare 210 km and 5 km setups of the land surface model JSBACH3 for an idealized case study in eastern Siberia to investigate the effects of high versus low-resolution land boundary conditions on simulating the interactions of soil physics, hydrology and vegetation. We show for the first time that there are differences in the spatial averages of the simulated fluxes and soil state variables between resolution setups. Most differences are small in the summer mean, but larger within individual months. Heterogeneous soil properties induce large parts of the differences while vegetation characteristics play a minor role. Active layer depth shows a statistically significant increase of +20% in the 5 km setup relative to the 210 km setup for the summer mean and +43% for August. The differences are due to the nonlinear vertical discretization of the soil column amplifying the impact of the heterogeneous distributions of soil organic matter content and supercooled water. Resolution-induced differences in evaporation fluxes amount to +43% in July and are statistically significant. Our results show that spatial resolution significantly affects model outcomes due to nonlinear processes in heterogenous land surfaces.

Local communities commonly prefer protective infrastructure, but it is less obvious that the general public will support this approach due to the growing costs. We study public opinion on these adaptation approaches using a choice experiment with nationally representative samples in the United States and Germany (n = 2400 each). We asked participants to prioritize federal funding between two hypothetical, equally sized communities differing in their adaptation strategy, flood frequency, lives and economic assets at risk, economic vitality, geographic distance, and political orientation.

The YRD compound heatwaves are intimately associated with the 10–30-day variations of air temperature, with 46 identified heatwaves during the summers of 1979–2022 mostly occurring within the positive phases of 10–30-day Tmax and Tmin anomalies. The coincidence of positive phases in 10–30-day Tmax and Tmin comes from a dipole pattern of the corresponding potential vorticity (PV) anomalies in the upper troposphere. This dipole PV pattern leads to anomalous descents in the YRD and associated anticyclones in the lower troposphere. As a result, the increased adiabatic heating and incident solar radiation cause the extreme daytime heat. The enhanced humidity in the YRD increases the downward longwave radiation, resulting in the extreme nighttime temperatures. As the increased temperature and humidity enhance stratification stability in the lower troposphere, the coupling between daytime and nighttime heat extremes persists, leading to a compound heatwave. During a YRD compound heatwave, the 10–30-day atmospheric intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) exerts a potential influence on the electricity demand and supply. Continuous extreme heat leads to a dramatic surge in cooling demand. While the influence of 10–30-day ISO on wind energy resources is weak, the dipole pattern of 10–30-day PV anomalies strongly reduces solar energy resources over the mid–lower reaches of the Yellow River, thus exerting greater challenges for electricity supply to the YRD."

Previous studies emphasized the role of western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), but there is a paradox that the contrasting climate extremes over STEA in 2020 and 2022 are both associated with anomalously strong WPSH. Given that local vertical motion has a dominant control on precipitation variability, here we investigate the mechanism for the variability of vertical motion in STEA. In most extratropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, ascent (descent) motion aligns with southerly (northerly) flow in the troposphere due to the northward tilting isentropic surfaces. However, isentropic surfaces tilt eastwards over STEA in the summer due to the existence of a strong warm center over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Thus, the ascent motion over the STEA is insensitive to the strength of southerly flow related to the intensity of the WPSH but sensitive to the strength of westerly flow related to the meridional shift of subtropical jet. The notably strong WPSH in 2020 and 2022 increased water vapor transport into STEA but had little impact on atmospheric vertical motion. However, the East Asian subtropical jet displaced southwards (northwards) in the summer of 2020 (2022), leading to anomalous westerly (easterly) flows in the mid-upper troposphere from TP to STEA on the jet’s southern flank, prompting anomalous ascent (descent) motion in STEA that contributed to the flood (drought) conditions in 2020 (2022). Our results highlight the essential role of anomalous zonal flow in generating surface climate extremes over STEA in the summer because of its strong control of vertical motion."

While considerable attention has been paid to current and future changes in temperature patterns, comparatively less attention has been devoted to water availability for humans and ecosystems. The aridity index (AI), the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration, is a common metric used to assess water availability within ecosystems. However, the role of snow in AI calculations within snowy eco-regions is often neglected, resulting in an incomplete understanding of water balance dynamics in these environments. In this study, we estimate aridification under ongoing climate change in Andean eco-regions (AEs), focusing on two horizons: 2050–2060 and 2090–2100. Using monthly TerraClimate data from 2013–2018, we calculated a mean AI for each AE, taking into account the absence of snow (pixels with a snow water equivalent (SWE) < 10 mm/month) and its presence (AI-snow; pixels with a SWE > 10 mm/month). We show that AI allows to differentiate the eco-regions, but that the incorporation of snow in the AI calculation highlights the heterogeneity of aridity conditions within some eco-regions with energy-limited regimes (AI > 1) in the snowy zones and water-limited regimes (AI < 1) elsewhere. Analysis of the CORDEX-SAM regional projections for the periods 2050–2060 and 2090–2100 indicates a general shift towards drier conditions prevailing over wetter conditions in most eco-regions, notably: the Southern Andean Steppe, the Central Andean Wet Puna, the Santa Marta Páramo, and the Peruvian Yungas. The projected reduction in snowfall in CORDEX-SAM, coupled with glacier volume loss, appears to be contributing to the prevalence of aridification across many AEs. These findings highlight potential transitions towards aridification in diverse eco-regions, with repercussions on water availability for humans and ecosystems."

In 2022, 48.5 trillion gallons of water were withdrawn for cooling systems in electricity production, of which 962.9 billion gallons of water were consumed and no longer available for downstream use. Conventional steam coal plants, in particular, withdrew 18.3 trillion gallons of water for once-through and recirculating cooling systems in 2022 while contributing to 19.7% of total U.S. net electricity generation. As coal-fueled electricity production becomes less competitive, cases of coal-to-gas retrofits occur to avoid stranded assets. Two retrofitting methods are adopted in practice: coal-fired power plants are repurposed and replaced by natural gas combined-cycle plants, or the boiler of a coal plant is converted to burn natural gas. In this study, we construct panel data and employ an event study framework to examine changes in water withdrawal, water consumption, water discharge, and carbon emissions resulting from coal-to-gas retrofits in the continental United States from 2013 to 2022. Seventeen coal-fired power plants have been replaced with natural gas combined-cycle plants, and 167 coal steam units in 85 plants have undergone coal-to-gas boiler conversions. We find a sharp and sustained reduction in water withdrawal of 40.2–53.9 thousand gallons per megawatt-hour of net electricity produced when a coal plant transitioned to a natural gas combined-cycle plant. Water discharge was also reduced by 30.7 thousand gallons, and carbon emissions decreased by 0.59 short tons per megawatt-hour. Yet, boiler conversion did not lead to statistically significant changes in per megawatt-hour water withdrawal, water consumption, water discharge, or carbon emissions. Spatial assessment further informs resource planning of projected water-stressed regions, as 204.6 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants remain operable in the United States in 2022. Fuel transition should adopt a nexus approach and account for the interdependence between water resources and electricity production to realize sustainable development commitments."

However, few studies have examined how this relationship endures in the face of experience with climate-related hazards and associated emotions, and whether detachment from place may be related to future migration. Here we address this gap using cross-sectional survey data from a representative probability-based sample of 1479 residents of Texas and Florida—areas frequently affected by coastal hazards—to investigate the interplay between place attachment, place detachment, negative hazard experiences, hazard-related fear and worry, and prospective migration. We found that place attachment and detachment were inversely associated with one another, and that hazard-related fear and worry was associated with higher place detachment. Results indicated that place detachment and hazard-related fear and worry were positively associated with prospective migration, while place attachment was negatively associated with prospective migration. The absence of place attachment and presence of detachment may lower psychological barriers to relocation in the face of climate change. Negative hazard experiences were not associated with place attachment, place detachment, or prospective migration. However, our post-hoc analyses found an indirect association between negative hazard experiences and prospective migration, mediated by hazard-related fear and worry. This suggests that psychological correlates of climate hazards, possibly arising from experiencing them, may inform people’s sense of place and future migration decisions. Our findings highlight the salience of relationships with place in migration decisions and stress the importance of explicitly examining negative sentiments towards place in migration studies. These insights can both improve climate migration models and help tailor policies and programs aimed at supporting detached, fearful, and worried individuals in anticipation of future climate-related hazards."

Here, we screened 92 independent published articles and performed a meta-analysis of the extracted data. The effects of grazing on four soil seed bank density and diversity indices were analyzed. Four alpha diversity indices, namely Shannon–Wiener, Margalef, Pielou, and Simpson indices, were selected in this study. The Shannon–Wiener index reflects the species complexity of the community. The Margalef index reflects species richness of the seed bank. The Pielou index reflects whether the number of seeds of all species in the seed bank is evenly distributed, and the Simpson’s index reflects the status of dominant plants in the seed bank. We found that grazing significantly decreased the total density of soil seed banks. Perennial plant seed banks were more affected by grazing than annual plant seed banks. Heavy grazing significantly decreased the Margalef index of seed banks, while moderate grazing significantly decreased the Simpson’s alpha diversity index. Long-term grazing (>10 years) had the greatest impact on Simpson’s alpha diversity index, while medium-term grazing (5–10 years) had a significant negative impact on Shannon–Wiener, Margalef, and Pielou indices. In addition, our results show that grazing has a greater effect on seed banks in arid areas than those in temperate areas. Knowledge of climate-specific effects will contribute to understanding the risk of local extinctions in grassland populations and help decision-makers maintain the health of grassland ecosystems."

This paper explores the complex interplay between mineral mining, socio-environmental impacts, and conflicts in the Southern and West African region, with a focus on the imperative of reflexive governance for achieving just transitions and environmental justice. Drawing on a comprehensive literature review and cases from Southern and Western African countries, this paper examines the multifaceted nature of socio-environmental impacts resulting from mineral mining. These impacts encompass ecological degradation and social inequalities, among others. Furthermore, the paper delves into the dynamics of conflicts arising from mineral mining and competing interests such as natural resources and land rights. Additionally, the paper examines governance structures aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and environmental sustainability. The paper concludes by highlighting the implications of reflexive governance as a transformative tool for addressing the socio-environmental impacts of mineral mining and conflicts in Southern and West Africa. It underscores the urgency of adopting holistic and integrated approaches that prioritize environmental protection, social equity, and community well-being in the context of mineral resource extraction. The African Union can serve as the catalyst for reflexive governance and environmental justice in mineral resource extraction, with citizens also holding national governments accountable."

However, the majority of previous studies have focused on overall effects of WWT, and very few have examined how land surface system responds to climate warming or wetting trend, respectively. For this purpose, this study uses the Community Land Model (CLM5) driven by the Chinese Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) to conduct four modeling experiments: a control experiment (CTRL) and three sensitivity experiments, in which the annual trend of air temperature (NonWarm), precipitation (NonWet), and both (NonWWT) are removed from the CMFD from 1979 to 2018. Compared to CTRL, the land hydrological variables (i.e. soil moisture, runoff and evapotranspiration) show a visible reduction in magnitude, interannual variability, as well as annual trend in NonWet, while they are enhanced in NonWarm. In both NonWarm and NonWet, the magnitude and trend of both net radiation and sensible heat fluxes increase, with a more pronounced change in NonWWT. Further analysis indicates that the land surface processes are more sensitive to wetting trend than to warming trend. Among all land surface hydrological variables and energy variables, runoff and snow cover fraction are the most susceptible to climate change. Overall, the effects of climate change in Ta and Pr on surface hydrological variables are non-linearly offsetting, while the effects on surface energy budgets are non-linearly superimposed. Compared to warming trend, wetting trend plays a larger impact on the variability of land surface processes in NWC."

Therefore, it is crucial to examine the extent to which GHG-induced changes in regional climate variability, in isolation from changes in mean climate, contribute to the frequency of extreme weather events. In this study, I build upon the concept of the fraction of attributable risk (FAR) by introducing the fraction of preventable risk (FPR), allowing for the assessment of GHG forcing’s contribution to risk reduction in scenarios of decreasing risk extremes. Results derived from four global climate models indicate that while the predominant factor amplifying the frequency of hot extremes is the mean warming, with a 18-fold increase in probability and an attributable risk fraction of 0.96 to GHG forcing, changes in regional climate variability have already modified the probability of extremes. In South Asia, for instance, the 12-fold increase in hot extremes resulting from mean warming is compounded by an additional ∼3 times, solely attributed to the increased temperature variability. Conversely, during winter in the Arctic, the 10-fold increase in the frequency of hot extremes due to mean warming is offset by a ∼2.5-fold decrease resulting from diminished variability, with a preventable risk fraction of −0.55 to GHG forcing. Concerning heavy-precipitation events, in certain regions, GHG-induced changes in precipitation variability carry greater significance than changes in the mean. For example, in the West African summer monsoon region GHG forcing is amplifying the risk of extreme monsoon precipitation by ∼4 times. This amplified risk of potential flooding arises from increases in both mean precipitation and variability. Separating attribution metrics into mean and variability components offers valuable insights into region-specific mechanisms affecting extreme event frequency."

Subseasonal forecast of this event challenges the limits of rainy season predictability. Employing the integrated atmospheric model across scales and the Sunway supercomputer, we conducted ensemble one-month forecasts at global 3 km, variable 4–60 km, and global 60 km resolutions. The global convection-permitting forecast accurately captures the rainband, while other forecasts exhibited northward and weaker shifts due to the northward shifts of the atmospheric rivers over Japan, attributed to intensified Western North Pacific Subtropical High (WNPSH). Further, the double-ITCZ-like tropical rainfall pattern in Western Pacific in global convection-permitting forecast contributes to a more accurate WNPSH and rainband. In contrast, other forecasts show a single-ITCZ-like pattern in Western Pacific, leading to a northward-shifted WNPSH and rainband, advocating the importance of accurately representing tropical convections, as they can significantly affect mid-/high-latitude weather and climate."

We successfully developed a new gridded rice calendar for monsoon Asia based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, which characterize transplanting and harvesting dates and the number of rice croppings in a comprehensive framework. Our rice calendar will be beneficial for rice management, production prediction, and the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions. 
 An accurate and spatially explicit large-scale rice calendar can enhance the understanding of agricultural practices and their ecological services, particularly in monsoon Asia. However, currently available global- or continental-scale rice calendars suffer from coarse resolution, poor recording, and outdated information; thus, they do not provide detailed and consistent information on rice phenology. To address this limitation, this study mapped a new (2019–2020) gridded (0.5°×0.5° resolution) rice calendar for monsoon Asia based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images. The novelty of this rice calendar lies in the development of a consistent optimal methodological framework that allows the spatially explicit characterization of the rice transplanting date, harvesting date, and number of rice cropping seasons. The methodological framework incorporates two steps: (1) detection of rice phenological dates and number of rice cropping seasons via the combination of a feature-based algorithm and the fitted Weibull function; (2) spatiotemporal integration of the detected transplanting and harvesting dates derived from Step 1 using von Mises maximum likelihood estimates. Results revealed that the proposed rice calendar can accurately identify the rice phenological dates for three croppings in monsoon Asia. When compared with single rice data from the census-based RiceAtlas calendar, the proposed calendar exhibited better results than the MODIS-based Rice Crop Calendar for Asia (RICA). It exhibited biases of 4 and −6 d for the transplanting and harvesting dates, respectively, with 10 and 15 d lower MAE values and 6 and 15 d lower RMSE values for the transplanting and harvesting dates, respectively. In total, the proposed rice calendar can detect single-, double-, and triple-rice-cropping seasons with an area of 0.53×106, 0.45×106, and 0.09×106 km2, respectively. This novel gridded rice calendar fills the gaps in 0.5° rice calendars across major global rice production areas, facilitating research on rice phenology that is relevant to climate change.

 Forecast error growth as a function of lead time of atmospheric phenomena is caused by initial and model errors. When studying the initial error growth, it may turn out that small-scale phenomena, which contribute little to the forecast product, significantly affect the ability to predict this product. The question under investigation is whether omitting these atmospheric phenomena will improve the predictability of the resulting value. The topic is studied in the extended Lorenz (2005) system. This system shows that omitting small spatiotemporal scales that significantly affect prediction ability will reduce predictability more than modeling it. In other words, a system with model error (omitting phenomena) will not improve predictability. A hypothesis explaining and describing this behavior is developed, with the difference between systems (model error) produced at each time step seen as the error of the initial conditions. The resulting model error is then defined as the sum of the increments of the time evolution of the initial conditions so defined. The hypothesis is compared to the fit parameters that define the model error in certain approximations of the average forecast error growth. Parameters are interpreted in this context, and the approximations are used to estimate the errors described in the hypothesis. A method is proposed to distinguish increments of prediction error growth from small-spatiotemporal-scale phenomena and model errors. Results are presented for the error growth of the ECMWF system, where a 40 % reduction in model error between 1987 and 2011 is calculated based on the developed hypothesis, while over the same period the instability (error growth rate) of the system with respect to initial condition errors has grown."

Parton,Development of a plant carbon–nitrogen interface coupling framework in a coupled biophysical-ecosystem–biogeochemical model (SSiB5/TRIFFID/DayCent-SOM v1.0),"A process-based plant carbon (C)–nitrogen (N) interface coupling framework has been developed which mainly focuses on plant resistance and N-limitation effects on photosynthesis, plant respiration, and plant phenology. A dynamic C / N ratio is introduced to represent plant resistance and self-adjustment. The framework has been implemented in a coupled biophysical-ecosystem–biogeochemical model, and testing results show a general improvement in simulating plant properties with this framework. 
 Plant and microbial nitrogen (N) dynamics and N availability regulate the photosynthetic capacity and capture, allocation, and turnover of carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems. Studies have shown that a wide divergence in representations of N dynamics in land surface models leads to large uncertainties in the biogeochemical cycle of terrestrial ecosystems and then in climate simulations as well as the projections of future trajectories. In this study, a plant C–N interface coupling framework is developed and implemented in a coupled biophysical-ecosystem–biogeochemical model (SSiB5/TRIFFID/DayCent-SOM v1.0). The main concept and structure of this plant C–N framework and its coupling strategy are presented in this study. This framework takes more plant N-related processes into account. The dynamic C/N ratio (CNR) for each plant functional type (PFT) is introduced to consider plant resistance and adaptation to N availability to better evaluate the plant response to N limitation. Furthermore, when available N is less than plant N demand, plant growth is restricted by a lower maximum carboxylation capacity of RuBisCO (Vc,max), reducing gross primary productivity (GPP). In addition, a module for plant respiration rates is introduced by adjusting the respiration with different rates for different plant components at the same N concentration. Since insufficient N can potentially give rise to lags in plant phenology, the phenological scheme is also adjusted in response to N availability. All these considerations ensure a more comprehensive incorporation of N regulations to plant growth and C cycling. This new approach has been tested systematically to assess the effects of this coupling framework and N limitation on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Long-term measurements from flux tower sites with different PFTs and global satellite-derived products are employed as references to assess these effects. The results show a general improvement with the new plant C–N coupling framework, with more consistent emergent properties, such as GPP and leaf area index (LAI), compared to the observations. The main improvements occur in tropical Africa and boreal regions, accompanied by a decrease in the bias in global GPP and LAI by 16.3 % and 27.1 %, respectively."

Here, we present the novel synthetic biogeochemical float capabilities of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 and demonstrate their utility as a test bed to address these uncertainties. 
 Since their advent over 2 decades ago, autonomous Argo floats have revolutionized the field of oceanography, and, more recently, the addition of biogeochemical and biological sensors to these floats has greatly improved our understanding of carbon, nutrient, and oxygen cycling in the ocean. While Argo floats offer unprecedented horizontal, vertical, and temporal coverage of the global ocean, uncertainties remain about whether Argo sampling frequency and density capture the true spatiotemporal variability in physical, biogeochemical, and biological properties. As the true distributions of, e.g., temperature or oxygen are unknown, these uncertainties remain difficult to address with Argo floats alone. Numerical models with synthetic observing systems offer one potential avenue to address these uncertainties. Here, we implement synthetic biogeochemical Argo floats into the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2), which build on the Lagrangian In Situ Global High-Performance Particle Tracking (LIGHT) module in E3SMv2 (E3SMv2-LIGHT-bgcArgo-1.0). Since the synthetic floats sample the model fields at model run time, the end user defines the sampling protocol ahead of any model simulation, including the number and distribution of synthetic floats to be deployed, their sampling frequency, and the prognostic or diagnostic model fields to be sampled. Using a 6-year proof-of-concept simulation, we illustrate the utility of the synthetic floats in different case studies. In particular, we quantify the impact of (i) sampling density on the float-derived detection of deep-ocean change in temperature or oxygen and on float-derived estimates of phytoplankton phenology, (ii) sampling frequency and sea-ice cover on float trajectory lengths and hence float-derived estimates of current velocities, and (iii) short-term variability in ecosystem stressors on estimates of their seasonal variability."

We describe its implementation in the Unified Forecast System (UFS). Simulations of the Cameron Peak ire allowed us to verify our implementation. Our vision is to foster collaborative development in fire behavior modeling with the ultimate goal of increasing our fundamental understanding of fire science and minimizing the adverse impacts of wildland fires. 
 There is an increasing need for simulating the evolution of wildland fires. The realism of the simulation increases by accounting for feedbacks between the fire and the atmosphere. These coupled models combine a fire behavior model with a regional numerical weather prediction model and have been used for fire research during the last decades. This is the case, for instance, of the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting model with fire extensions (WRF-Fire). Typically, the coupling includes specific code for the particular models being coupled such as interpolation procedures to pass variables from the atmospheric grid to the fire grid, and vice versa. However, having a fire modeling framework that can be coupled to different atmospheric models is advantageous to foster collaborations and joint developments. With this aim, we have created, for the first time, a fire behavior model that can be connected to other atmospheric models without the need of developing specific low-level procedures for the particular atmospheric model being used. The fire behavior model, referred to as the Community Fire Behavior model (CFBM), closely follows WRF-Fire version 4.3.3 methods in its version 0.2.0, and makes use of the Earth System Modeling Framework library to communicate information between the fire and the atmosphere. The CFBM can be also run offline using an existing WRF simulation in what we refer to as the standalone model. Herein we describe the fire modeling framework and its implementation in the Unified Forecast System (UFS). Simulations of the Cameron Peak Fire performed with UFS and WRF-Fire are presented to verify our implementation. Results from both models, as well as with the standalone version, are consistent indicating a proper development of the CFBM and its coupling to the UFS-Atmosphere. These results, and the possibility of using the fire behavior model with other atmospheric models, provide an attractive collaborative framework to further improve the realism of the model in order to meet the growing demand for accurate wildland fire simulations."

In this study, the hydro-biogeochemical model of CNMM-DNDC was improved by incorporating a new forest growth module derived from the Biome-BGC. The updated model was validated using the multiple-year observed carbon fluxes and showed better performance in capturing the daily dynamics and annual variations. The sensitive eco-physiological parameters were also identified. 
 Carbon exchange between forest ecosystems and the atmosphere play an important role in global carbon cycle, which is difficult to be accurately quantified due to the large uncertainties in scaling up site-scale observations or filling-up measurement gaps. A process-oriented model equipped with comprehensive processes to explicitly simulating coupled carbon, nitrogen and water cycling, is hypothesized to reduce the uncertainties in quantification of forest carbon fluxes. To test this hypothesis, the Catchment Nutrient Management Model – DeNitrification-DeComposition (CNMM-DNDC), as a hydro-biogeochemical model that dynamically couples the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and water cycling processes, was updated in this study by incorporating a new forest growth module derived from the Biome-BGC model and validating the updates using multiple-year continuous observations of carbon and water fluxes at the site scale. The updated model has improved the processes of photosynthesis, litter decomposition, allocation, respiration and mortality to more effectively capture the transformation and transportation of nutrients in plant-soil-water continuum. The observed gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) of three typical forest sites subject to subtropical and temperate climates in eastern Asia (2003–2010) were used for the model calibration and validation. Compared with the original model in validation, the updated model showed significant improvements in simulating the daily dynamics and inter-annual variations of each variable, with the NRMSE values decreased by 46 % and 54 %, 65 % and 37 %, 4 % and -6 %, and 38 % and -3 % for GPP, ER, NEE, and ET on daily and annual scales, respectively. The comparable performances of both model versions for annual NEE emphasizes the importance of validating each component of carbon fluxes to avoid the offsetting of model errors. The canopy average specific leaf area, fraction of leaf nitrogen in Rubisco, annual leaf and fine root turnover fraction, maximum stomatal conductance and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in leaves and fine roots were identified as the sensitive eco-physiological parameters affecting the simulations of GPP and ER. In addition, the meteorological variables of solar radiation, humidity and air temperature also showed strong influences on the simulated GPP and ER. The relatively satisfactory performances demonstrated that the modified model has the ability to capture the daily dynamics and inter-annual variations of carbon fluxes for forests in temperate and subtropical zones, which is essential for estimating the emissions of greenhouse gases at the regional or global scales."

Since BPA has been banned in maternal and infant food containers in many countries, BPA substitutes have been widely introduced to replace it. By systematically assessing the potential developmental toxicity of BPA substitutes, we observed that the 41–150 nM in vivo BPC exposure (around the reported concentration detected in infant urine: 6–186 nM) induced cardiac defects in zebrafish. Mechanistically, BPC disrupted m6A homeostasis by downregulation of the key m6A methyltransferase, Mettl3, thereby causing the m6A reader, Igf2bp2b, to fail in recognizing and stabilizing the inefficiently m6A-modified acox1 and tnnt2d mRNA. Then, downregulation of Acox1 (a regulator in cardiac fatty acid metabolism) and Tnnt2d (a component of cardiac troponin for muscle contraction) led to cardiac defects. Indeed, the dual cardiac functional axes regulated by the same m6A reader in response to BPC provided new insight into the regulatory mechanisms of epitranscriptomics and cardiac development. Collectively, our study not only presented evidence showing that the internal exposure levels of BPC in humans could lead to cardiac developmental defects but also demonstrated the underlying mechanism of BPC-mediated defects by disrupting the Mettl3-m6A-Igf2bp2b-Acox1/Tnnt2d pathways, which provided potential molecular markers associated with BPC exposure."

However, current studies mainly focus on separate evaluation or diagnosis, leading to an inadequate exploration of the relationship between stressors and responses. Here, based on multiple data sets in an urban lake system, a synchronous evaluation-diagnosis model with quantitative stressor-response analysis was advanced, aiming to improve the accuracy of evaluation and diagnosis. The weights for key physicochemical stressors were quantitatively determined in the sequence of NDAVIadj > CODMn > TP > NH4+–N by the combination of generalized additive model and structural equation modeling, clarifying the most significant effects of aquatic vegetation on the degradation of fish assemblages. Then, sensitive biological metrics were screened by considering the distinct contributions of four key stressors to alleviate the possible deviation caused by common methods. Finally, ecological integrity was evaluated by summing the key physicochemical stressors and sensitive biological metrics according to the model-deduced weights instead of empirical weights.

A sediment trap was moored at a depth of 4900 m at Station KEO within the Kuroshio Extension recirculation gyre, and the vertical flux of microplastics in sinking particles of size <1 mm was observed. Forty-one sediment-trap samples collected from July 1, 2014, to October 2, 2016, were analyzed with a micro-Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and microplastics were detected in all samples. Seventeen polymer types were identified, and 90% of the microplastics were less than 100 μm in size. Microplastic sinking was driven by the action of the biological pump, which was in turn driven by seasonal variations in solar radiation and increased surface primary production typical of the spring season. Microplastic mass flux varied from 4.5 × 10–3 to 0.38 mg m–2 day–1 during the sampling period, with a mean and standard deviation of 0.054 ± 0.075 mg m–2 day–1.

Efforts to quantify the occurrence, drivers, and severity of HABs across large areas is difficult due to the resource intensive nature of field monitoring of lake nutrient and chlorophyll‐a concentrations. To better characterize how nutrients interact with other environmental factors to produce algal blooms in freshwater systems, we used spatially explicit and temporally matched climate, landscape, in‐lake characteristic, and nutrient inventory data sets to predict nutrients and chlorophyll‐a across the conterminous US (CONUS). Using a nested modeling approach, three random forest (RF) models were trained to explain the spatiotemporal variation in total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll‐a concentrations across US EPA's National Lakes Assessment (n = 2,062). Concentrations of TN and TP were the most important predictors and, with other variables, the RF model accounted for 68% of variation in chlorophyll‐a. We then used these RF models to extrapolate lake TN and TP predictions to lakes without nutrient observations and predict chlorophyll‐a for ∼112,000 lakes across the CONUS. Risk for high chlorophyll‐a concentrations is highest in the agriculturally dominated Midwest, but other areas of risk emerge in nutrient pollution hot spots across the country. These catchment and lake‐specific results can help managers identify potential nutrient pollution and chlorophyll‐a hot spots that may fuel blooms, prioritize at‐risk lakes for additional monitoring, and optimize management to protect human health and other environmental end goals."

A 2021 moratorium on commercial fishing in the Arctic high seas provides a 16‐year runway for improved scientific understanding. Given substantial knowledge gaps, characterizing areas of highest uncertainty is a key first step. Marine ecosystem model ensembles that project future fish distributions could inform management of future Arctic fisheries, but Arctic‐specific variation has not yet been examined for global ensembles. We use the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Intercomparison Project ensemble driven by two Earth System Models (ESMs) under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1‐2.6 and SSP5‐8.5) to illustrate the current state of and uncertainty among biomass projections for the Arctic Ocean over the duration of the moratorium. The models generally project biomass increases in more northern Arctic ecosystems and decreases in southern ecosystems, but wide intra‐model variation exceeds projection means in most cases. The two ESMs show opposite trends for the main environmental drivers. Therefore, these projections are currently insufficient to inform policy actions. Investment in sustained monitoring and improving modeling capacity, especially for sea ice dynamics, is urgently needed. Concurrently, it will be necessary to develop frameworks for making precautionary decisions under continued uncertainty. We conclude that researchers should be transparent about uncertainty, presenting these model projections not as a source of scientific “answers,” but as bounding for plausible, policy‐relevant questions to assess trade‐offs and mitigate risks."

Despite local government's efforts to initiate coastal monitoring networks and qualitative risk guidelines, there remains a gap in detailed and efficient quantitative assessments for combinations of multiple sea‐level components. To address this, we develop the Tropical Cyclone Storm Surge‐based Flood Risk Assessment under Combined Scenarios (TCSoS‐FRACS). This framework integrates impacts of storm surges, high tides, and sea‐level rise using a hybrid of statistical and dynamic models to balance reliability and efficiency. By combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, it incorporates economic and demographic factors for a deeper understanding of risk composition. Applying TCSoS‐FRACS to Hainan Island reveals that the combined effects of storm surges, high tides, and sea‐level rise significantly amplify local coastal flood risk, increasing economic losses to 4.27–5.90 times and affected populations to 4.96–6.23 times. Additionally, transitioning from Fossil‐fueled Development (SSP5‐8.5) to Sustainability (SSP1‐1.9) can reduce the risk increase by approximately half. The equivalence in flood hazard between current high tides and future sea level under a sustainable scenario boosts confidence in climate change adaptation efforts. However, coastal cities with low hazard but high exposure need heightened vigilance in flood defense, as future risk could escalate sharply.

The rising groundwater table also exacerbates the risk of pluvial, fluvial, and groundwater flooding in coastal regions. However, current Earth system models (ESMs) commonly ignore the exchanges of water at the land‐ocean interface. To address this gap, we developed a novel land‐ocean hydrologic coupling scheme in a state‐of‐the‐science ESM, the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2). The new scheme includes the lateral exchange between seawater and groundwater and the vertical infiltration of seawater driven by the SLR‐induced inundation. Simulations were performed with the updated E3SMv2 for the global land‐ocean interface to assess the impacts of SLR on coastal groundwater under a high CO2 emission scenario. By the middle of this century, seawater infiltration on the inundated areas will be the dominant component in the land‐ocean coupling process, while the lateral subsurface flow exchange will be much smaller. The SLR‐induced seawater infiltration will raise the groundwater levels, enhance evapotranspiration, and increase runoff with distinct spatial patterns globally in the future. Although the coupling process is induced by SLR, we found topography and warming temperature have more control on the coupling impacts, probably due to the relatively modest magnitude of SLR during the selected future period. Overall, our study suggests significant groundwater and seawater exchange at the land‐ocean interface, which needs to be considered in ESMs."

Evaluating these impacts is challenging due to the coarse spatial resolution of global climate models (GCMs); therefore, bias correction is widely used. Here, we applied two statistical methods—standard empirical quantile mapping (EQM) and a hybrid approach, EQM with linear correction (EQM‐LIN)—to bias correct precipitation and air temperature simulated by nine GCMs. We used historical observations from 20 weather stations across South Florida to project future climate under three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Compared to the EQM, the hybrid EQM‐LIN method improved R2 of daily quantiles by up to 30% over the historical period and improved MAE up to 70% in months that contain most extreme values. Projected extreme precipitation at the weather stations showed that, compared to the EQM‐LIN, the EQM method underestimates the high quantiles by up to 26% in SSP585. The projected changes in annual maximum precipitation from historical period (1985–2014) to near future (2040–2069) and far future (2070–2100) were between 2% and 16% across the study area. Projected future precipitation suggested a slight decrease during summer but an increase in fall. This, along with rising summer temperatures, suggested that South Florida can experience rapid oscillations from warmer summers and increased flooding in fall under future climate. Additionally, our comparative analyses with globally and nationally downscaled studies showed that such coarse scale studies do not represent the climatic extremes well, particularly for high quantile precipitation."

In this process, two pivotal decisions are (a) the Bias Correction Method (BCM) and (b) how to handle the historically observed time series, which can be used as a continuous whole (i.e., without dividing it into sub‐periods), or partitioned into monthly, seasonal (e.g., 3 months), or any other temporal stratification (TS). Here, we examine how the interplay between the choice of BCM, TS, and the raw GCM seasonality may affect historical portrayals and projected changes. To this end, we use outputs from 29 GCMs belonging to the CMIP6 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5–8.5 scenario, using seven BCMs and three TSs (entire period, seasonal, and monthly). The results show that the effectiveness of BCMs in removing biases can vary depending on the TS and climate indices analyzed. Further, the choice of BCM and TS may yield different projected change signals and seasonality (especially for precipitation), even for climate models with low bias and a reasonable representation of precipitation seasonality during a reference period. Because some BCMs may be computationally expensive, we recommend using the linear scaling method as a diagnostics tool to assess how the choice of TS may affect the projected precipitation seasonality of a specific GCM. More generally, the results presented here unveil trade‐offs in how BCMs are applied, regardless of the climate regime, urging the hydroclimate community to carefully implement these techniques."

The forest management‐induced forest productivity change shows diverse responses across all SSPs, with a global increase from 2015 to 2100 ranging from 3.9% (SSP3) to 8.8% (SSP1). This further leads to an overall decrease in the total area with a change of land use types, with the largest decrease under SSP1 (−7.5%) and the smallest decrease under SSP3 (−0.7%) in 2100. Among land use types, considering forest management‐induced change significantly reduces the expansion of managed forest and also reduces the loss of natural land in 2100 across SSPs. This suggests that ignoring forest management‐induced forest productivity change underestimates the efficiency of wood production, overestimates the managed forest expansion required to meet the future demand, and consequently, potentially introduces uncertainties into relevant analyses, for example, carbon cycle and biodiversity. Thus, we advocate to better account for the impacts of forest management in future LULCC projections."

Mapping and quantifying contemporary vertical land motion (VLM) at continental scales has long been a challenge due to the absence of gridded observational products covering these large domains. Here, we fill this gap by using the new European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) to assess the current state of coastal VLM in Europe. First, we compare the InSAR‐based EGMS Ortho (Level 3) with nearby global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) vertical velocity estimates and show that the geodetic reference frame used to calibrate EGMS strongly influences coastal vertical land velocity estimates at the millimeter per year level and this needs to be considered with caution. After adjusting the EGMS vertical velocity estimates to a more updated and accurate International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2014), we performed an assessment of VLM in European low elevation coastal flood plains (CFPs). We find that nearly half of the European CFP area is, on average, subsiding at a rate faster than 1 mm/yr. More importantly, we find that urban areas and populations located in the CFP experience a near −1 mm/yr VLM on average (excluding the uplifting Fennoscandia region). For harbors, the average VLM is even larger and increases to −1.5 mm/yr on average. This demonstrates the widespread importance of continental‐scale assessments based on InSAR and GNSS to better identify areas at higher risk from relative SLR due to coastal subsidence."

Therefore, exploring novel methods of increasing early warning capabilities is of vital importance to reducing food‐insecurity risk. We present a XGBoost machine‐learning model to predict food‐security crises up to 12 months in advance. We used >20 data sets and the FEWS IPC current‐situation estimates to train the machine‐learning model. Food‐security dynamics were captured effectively by the model up to 3 months in advance (R2 > 0.6). Specifically, we predicted 20% of crisis onsets in pastoral regions (n = 96) and 20%–50% of crisis onsets in agro‐pastoral regions (n = 22) with a 3‐month lead time. We also compared our 8‐month model predictions to the 8‐month food‐security outlooks produced by FEWS NET. Over a relatively short test period (2019–2022), results suggest the performance of our predictions is similar to FEWS NET for agro‐pastoral and pastoral regions. However, our model is clearly less skilled in predicting food security for crop‐farming regions than FEWS NET. With the well‐established FEWS NET outlooks as a basis, this study highlights the potential for integrating machine‐learning methods into operational systems like FEWS NET."

Excessive groundwater abstraction, sea‐level rise (SLR), land subsidence and other climate‐related factors are expected to accelerate this process in the future. The objective of this study is to (a) quantify the impact of projected climate change and (b) explore the role of individual hydrogeological boundaries on groundwater salinization of low‐lying coastal groundwater systems until 2100 CE. We employ numerical density‐dependent groundwater flow and salt transport modeling for this purpose, using Northwestern Germany as a case. Separate model variants are constructed and forced with climate data, that is, projected SLR and groundwater recharge, as well as likely ranges of other hydrogeological boundaries, including land subsidence, abstraction rates and drain levels. We find that autonomous salinization in the marsh areas, resulting from non‐equilibrium of the present‐day groundwater salinity distribution with current boundary conditions, is responsible for >50% of the salinization increase until 2100 CE. Sea‐level rise, land subsidence and drain levels are the other major factors controlling salinization. We further show that salinization of the water resources is a potential threat to coastal water users, including water suppliers and the agrarian sector, as well as coastal ecosystems. Regional‐scale uplifting of drain levels is identified as an efficient measure to mitigate salinization of deep and shallow groundwater in the future. The presented modeling approach highlights the consequences of climate change and anthropogenic impacts for coastal salinization, supporting the timely development of mitigation strategies."

The event was accompanied by drier conditions driven by prolonged atmospheric blocking. During the heatwave, the maximum 6‐day means of humidex and temperature (HX‐6 and TX‐6) exhibited larger anomalies (6.70 and 5.57°C) compared to the 95th percentiles (HX95 and TX95) (4.12 and 3.73°C), relative to 1981–2021 extended summer (June‐September) averages. Extreme indices of humidex show faster and larger increases than those of temperature, reflecting the nonlinear positive relationship between humidex and temperature. Future projections from a multi‐model ensemble of 19 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase six (CMIP6) Global Climate Models (GCMs) clearly show an increase in humidex and temperature extremes, especially under intermediate and high emissions scenarios.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between PFAS and steroid hormones in human milk from women living close to an e‐waste disassembly area.

We also performed multiple linear regression analysis to clarify the association between maternal PFAS exposure and steroid hormone concentrations. Our results indicated that PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with estrone (β, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08–0.39) and A‐dione (β, 0.186; 95% CI, 0.016–0.357) concentrations in human milk, respectively.

Of concern, the PFAS intake of breastfeeding infants in the study area was higher than the recommended threshold.

As for other countries of Southern Europe, Spain is a region highly affected by heat and its increase under climate change. This is observed in the mean values and the increasing incidence of extreme weather events and associated mortality. Despite the vast knowledge on this topic, it remains unclear whether specific types and characteristics of HW are particularly harmful to the population and whether this shows a regional interdependency. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between HW characteristics and mortality in 12 Spanish cities. We used separated time series analysis in each city applying a quasi‐Poisson regression model and distributed lag linear and non‐linear models. Results show an increase in the mortality risk under HW conditions in the cities with a lower HW frequency. However, this increase exhibits remarkable differences across the cities under study not showing any general pattern in the HW characteristics‐mortality association. This relationship is shown to be complex and strongly dependent on the local properties of each city pointing out the crucial need to examine and understand on a local scale the HW characteristics and the HW‐mortality relationship for an efficient design and implementation of prevention measures."

 DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ) plays an essential role in replicating damaged DNA templates but contributes to mutagenesis due to its low fidelity. Therefore, ensuring tight control of Pol ζ’s activity is critical for continuous and accurate DNA replication, yet the specific mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals a regulation mechanism of Pol ζ activity in human cells. Under normal conditions, an autoinhibition mechanism keeps the catalytic subunit, REV3L, inactive. Upon encountering replication stress, however, ATR-mediated phosphorylation of REV3L’s S279 cluster activates REV3L and triggers its degradation via a caspase-mediated pathway. This regulation confines the activity of Pol ζ, balancing its essential role against its mutations causing potential during replication stress. Overall, our findings elucidate a control scheme that fine tunes the low-fidelity polymerase activity of Pol ζ under challenging replication scenarios.

Here, authors propose scCAD, a method that combines cluster decomposition and anomaly detection to effectively identify rare cell types across diverse biological scenarios. 
 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have become essential tools for characterizing cellular landscapes within complex tissues. Large-scale single-cell transcriptomics holds great potential for identifying rare cell types critical to the pathogenesis of diseases and biological processes. Existing methods for identifying rare cell types often rely on one-time clustering using partial or global gene expression. However, these rare cell types may be overlooked during the clustering phase, posing challenges for their accurate identification. In this paper, we propose a Cluster decomposition-based Anomaly Detection method (scCAD), which iteratively decomposes clusters based on the most differential signals in each cluster to effectively separate rare cell types and achieve accurate identification. We benchmark scCAD on 25 real-world scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods. In-depth case studies across diverse datasets, including mouse airway, brain, intestine, human pancreas, immunology data, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, showcase scCAD’s efficiency in identifying rare cell types in complex biological scenarios. Furthermore, scCAD can correct the annotation of rare cell types and identify immune cell subtypes associated with disease, thereby offering valuable insights into disease progression.

 Electrochemical organic synthesis is typically conducted in organic media. The solvent and related supporting electrolytes negatively affect the greenness of electrosynthesis. In this work, with 100% water used as the solvent, we realize aggregation-driven electrochemical radical cross coupling of unsaturated compounds driven by water tension. A key finding is that aggregation of the substrate at the electrode confined the radical intermediate and prevented side reactions, thus providing a way to regulate radical reactions in addition to their native properties. The reaction provides up to 90% yields with almost quantitative chemoselectivity. The pure water system readily yields the products via cold filtration, and the solvent is recycled repeatedly. In particular, the life span of the radical species generated in the reaction increase significantly because of the confined environment in the aggregation state. The greenness of this protocol is further enhanced with readily separation of product from media using cooling and filtration.

Here, authors have determined the atomic structure of a receptor bound to an odorant molecule that showing how the odorant binds and activates the receptor. 
 There are two main families of G protein-coupled receptors that detect odours in humans, the odorant receptors (ORs) and the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Their amino acid sequences are distinct, with the TAARs being most similar to the aminergic receptors such as those activated by adrenaline, serotonin, dopamine and histamine. To elucidate the structural determinants of ligand recognition by TAARs, we have determined the cryo-EM structure of a murine receptor, mTAAR7f, coupled to the heterotrimeric G protein Gs and bound to the odorant N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA) to an overall resolution of 2.9 Å. DMCHA is bound in a hydrophobic orthosteric binding site primarily through van der Waals interactions and a strong charge-charge interaction between the tertiary amine of the ligand and an aspartic acid residue. This site is distinct and non-overlapping with the binding site for the odorant propionate in the odorant receptor OR51E2. The structure, in combination with mutagenesis data and molecular dynamics simulations suggests that the activation of the receptor follows a similar pathway to that of the β-adrenoceptors, with the significant difference that DMCHA interacts directly with one of the main activation microswitch residues, Trp6.48.

 The coherent continental-wide speleothem water isotope records are accompanied by regionally inconsistent moisture patterns within the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) region, leaving a disputed explanation of monsoonal hydroclimate variability at the orbital timescale. Here, the transient simulation forced by orbital parameters during the past 300,000 years in an isotope-enabled fully coupled model shows that the complex ASM response can be understood as a grand dipole pattern of oxygen isotope and rainfall between South Asia and Japan, with South China lying in a hybrid transition region. While the dipole monsoon rainfall change between South Asia and Japan is related to the large-scale circulation adjustment in response to Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, the dipole oxygen isotope pattern is associated with the changing contribution of moisture sources. Our results provide new clues to reconcile ASM hydroclimate patterns at orbital timescale as revealed by the water isotope records and other hydrological proxies."

 Reconstructing early human colonization of the Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean is challenging due to limited archaeological evidence. Current understanding places human arrival ~4400 years ago. Here, U-series data from phreatic overgrowth on speleothems are combined with the discovery of a submerged bridge in Genovesa Cave that exhibits a distinctive coloration band near its top. The band is at the same depth as the phreatic overgrowth on speleothems (−1.1 meters), both of which indicate a sea-level stillstand between ~6000 and ~5400 years ago. Integrating the bridge depth with a high-resolution Holocene sea-level curve for Mallorca and the dated phreatic overgrowth on speleothems level constrains the construction of the bridge between ~6000 and ~5600 years ago. Subsequent sea-level rise flooded the archeological structure, ruling out later construction dates.

 Global atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide have been increasing over previous decades with emerging research suggesting the Arctic as a notable contributor. Thermokarst processes, increasing temperature, and changes in drainage can cause degradation of polygonal tundra landscape features resulting in elevated, well-drained, unvegetated soil surfaces that exhibit large nitrous oxide emissions. Here, we outline the magnitude and some of the dominant factors controlling variability in emissions for these thermokarst landscape features in the North Slope of Alaska. We measured strong nitrous oxide emissions during the growing season from unvegetated high centered polygons (median (mean) = 104.7 (187.7) µg N2O-N m−2 h−1), substantially higher than mean rates associated with Arctic tundra wetlands and of similar magnitude to unvegetated hotspots in peat plateaus and palsa mires. In the absence of vegetation, isotopic enrichment of 15N in these thermokarst features indicates a greater influence of microbial processes, (denitrification and nitrification) from barren soil. Findings reveal that the thermokarst features discussed here (~1.5% of the study area) are likely a notable source of nitrous oxide emissions, as inferred from chamber-based estimates. Growing season emissions, estimated at 16 (28) mg N2O-N ha−1 h−1, may be large enough to affect landscape-level greenhouse gas budgets.

 Branch architecture provides crucial information for the understanding of plant trait variability and the adaptive strategies employed by trees in response to their environment. High-fidelity terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data provide an accurate, efficient, and non-destructive means for constructing three-dimensional (3D) tree models and estimating architectural traits. However, the complex canopy structure of trees in natural forests and the presence of occlusion in TLS data pose significant challenges to achieving this goal. In this study, we present a novel algorithm, L1-Tree, for the construction of 3D tree models and the estimation of architectural traits from TLS data. This algorithm is grounded in the L1-Median algorithm and integrates a tree skeleton optimization procedure that considers the structural characteristics of tree branches. By comparing modeling results and manually derived branch traits for 24 trees of 24 species, we found that the L1-Tree algorithm achieved precision, recall, and F-score values of 0.94 for branch identification, coefficient of determination, root-mean-squared error, and normalized root-mean-squared error of 0.998, 0.068 m, and 0.3 % for branch length estimation, and a respective value of 0.958, 0.257 cm and 0.9 % for branch radius estimation. Additionally, the branch identification accuracy and accuracy in branch architectural trait estimation remained satisfactory across branch orders. Compared to established 3D tree model construction algorithms (e.g., TreeQSM), our L1-Tree algorithm demonstrated a superior capability in handling noisy environments and data gaps, making it a robust tool for TLS data-based tree architecture studies. Leaf-wood separation emerged as a crucial step influencing the performance of the L1-Tree algorithm. We observed significant drop in branch identification accuracy when using an automatic leaf-wood separation algorithm as input, highlighting the urgent need to develop effective leaf-wood separation algorithms to generate high-quality wood point clouds for tree architecture studies."

 For over four decades, spaceborne multispectral data have played a crucial role in supporting mineral exploration and geologic mapping. The spaceborne multispectral datasets, however, have a restricted number of bands with coarse spectral resolution and, thus are very limited in mineral mapping. The advent of high-quality spaceborne imaging spectroscopic data like the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), has bridged this gap initiating a new era in global hyperspectral mineral mapping. The EnMAP satellite, operational since November 2022, covers the spectral range of 420 and 2450 nm in 224 bands, offering a spatial resolution of 30 m and a mean spectral sampling distance of 8.1 and 12.5 nm in the visible-near infrared and shortwave infrared regions, respectively. In this paper, we demonstrate the enhanced mapping capabilities of EnMAP using datasets acquired over the Reko Diq mining district, a cluster of Miocene porphyries located in Pakistan's Chagai Belt hosting an undeveloped world-class porphyry Cu-Au ± Mo deposit. The EnMAP's Level 2A data product was processed using the polynomial fitting technique to characterize the diagnostic absorption features of the alteration minerals in the Reko Diq porphyry system. This involved retrieving the minimum wavelength, depth, width, and asymmetry parameters for key absorption features and employing them interactively for mineral characterization. A diverse array of minerals were successfully mapped over the study area and validated by ground spectroscopy. This includes abundance/composition maps for white micas, chlorite, epidote, calcite, kaolinite, gypsum, jarosite, and ferric and ferrous iron minerals. The minimum wavelength of white mica was found to vary between 2195 and 2210 nm, with the shorter wavelengths (Al-rich) white mica occurring proximal to the known mineralized zones. The potassic alteration cores and the outer propylitic zones were identified by the ferrous iron and chlorite-epidote-calcite mineral maps, respectively. This study demonstrated the superiority of EnMAP hyperspectral data in delineating the alteration mineralogy and zonation pattern of porphyry copper systems.

 Extracting buildings from True Digital Ortho Maps often encounters occlusions and misidentifications, making it challenging to obtain complete, regular, and accurate building contours. To address this issue, we developed a building recognition process based on the Segment Anything Model, and proposed a novel regularization algorithm for building contour inference and fitting, which quantifies the confidence levels of contour points to accurately fit building contours from data containing substantial noise, and reformulates the fitting problem as progressive node classification tasks consisting of contour simplification, iterative regularization, and rationality assessment. In experimental evaluations, the proposed contour fitting algorithm achieved 97.99 % Intersection over Union (IoU), 95.39 % consistency with the standard contour edge count, and 88.06 % of cases with Hausdorff distances less than or equal to 15 pixels (30 cm), significantly outperforming comparative methods. Notably, it was the only contour regularization algorithm that improved IoU (1.03 %) compared to the original contours. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively suppresses noise and infers incomplete building contours, producing accurate and regular contours comparable to manual delineation. It is particularly suitable for buildings with near-orthogonal structures, exhibiting significant practical applicability and generalization potential."

 Reservoir landslides in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China, exhibit prolonged slow motion and the potential for catastrophic events due to fluctuations in reservoir levels and intense rainfall episodes. Their distinct step-like deformation characteristics, involving rapid transformation processes of different states, pose challenges for accurate early warning and prediction. Previous forecasting models have often struggled with limited accuracy. This study introduces a mechanism-assisted deep learning model, leveraging the Informer architecture, to predict prolonged step-like reservoir landslide displacement. Utilizing a 15-year continuous monitoring dataset of the Baishuihe landslide, this model investigates the landslide mechanism, identifies influencing conditions underlying the step-wise behavior, and customizes input features for the prediction model by integrating optimized variational mode decomposition and wavelet analysis. Additionally, the dynamic correlation and hysteresis analysis between triggering factors and displacement offer valuable physical insights into the model and enhance the interpretability of the model. The model is further tailored to accommodate features of the monitoring dataset associated with landslide evolution by integrating a global multi-head attention mechanism and pooling layers, enabling the capture of both globe dependencies and local critical features of the model inputs. Through rigorous model training, performance evaluation, and tuning, the proposed model efficiently predicts step-wise landslide displacement, particularly during short-term rapid transitions between creep-mutation states."

Cortical GluN2B subunit–containing NMDARs were preferentially recruited upon encoding of associative olfactory memory to support neuronal allocation of memory engrams. As consolidation proceeds, a learning-induced redistribution of GluN2B subunit–containing NMDARs outward synapses increased synaptic GluN2A subunit contribution and enabled stabilization of remote memories. In contrast, synaptic reincorporation of GluN2B subunits occurred during subsequent forgetting.

The representative RAP, L10-MMBen, can direct the rearrangement of PG vesicles into a lamellar structure with its helix axis parallel to the PG membrane surface. The helical structure imparts both the thermodynamic and kinetic advantages of L10-MMBen/PG assembly, and the hiding of hydrophobic regions in RAPs is crucial for PG recognition. L10-MMBen exhibits high selectivity against bacteria depending on PG recognition, showing low in vivo toxicity and significant treatment efficacy in mice infection models. Our study introduces a helicity-direct bacterial phospholipid recognition paradigm for designing highly selective antimicrobial peptides."

These challenges restrain chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell efficacy, underlining the importance of armoring. In solid cancers, a localized tumor mass allows alternative administration routes, such as intratumoral delivery with the potential to improve efficacy and safety but may compromise metastatic-site treatment. Using a multi-layered CAR T cell engineering strategy that allowed a synergy between attributes, we show enhanced cytotoxic activity of MUC1 CAR T cells armored with PD1KO, tumor-specific interleukin-12 release, and TGFBR2KOattributes catered towards the TNBC TME. Intratumoral treatment effectively reduced distant tumors, suggesting retention of antigen-recognition benefits at metastatic sites.

We aggregate a geodetic record of SSEs from subduction zones in the circum-Pacific region. In aggregate, earthquake rates increase up to threefold concurrent with and proximal to SSEs. The relative amplitude of this increase is correlated with the SSE size and, to a lesser extent, their depth and region. The subdued and coincident earthquake response to SSE stress transfer suggests a more limited role of static stress transfer and a very short relaxation timescale for the triggered seismicity. The observed range of behavior does not support a major connection between SSEs and earthquake hazard."

Here, we show how embryonic experience with vocalizations carried out by parents during nest-relief displays at incubation adaptively shapes avian offspring development, providing lasting benefits to offspring. Genetic siblings prenatally exposed to different levels of parent-parent communication showed differences in epigenetic patterns, adrenocortical responsiveness, development, and food solicitation behavior. The correspondence between prenatal acoustic experience and parental context positively influenced the nutritional status and growth rate of offspring reared by communicative parents. Offspring can thus retain strong control over their own development by gathering prenatal acoustic information about parental generosity."

We address the limitation by using a symmetry-broken amplitude-only spatial light modulator, demonstrating image quality comparable to that of two-dimensional displays. The broken conjugate symmetry induced by phase noise of modulators eliminates conjugate image that causes issues in amplitude-only holograms and allows direct reconstruction without additional optical elements. The proposed method provides enhanced robustness against artifacts caused by sub-pixel structures of modulators, enabling experimental reconstruction of high-quality holograms. The full bandwidth and the robustness result in a 5-decibel improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to state-of-the-art holograms.

Understanding the response of soil carbon (C) dynamics in these forests to warming is of paramount importance, yet significant uncertainty remains. In this meta-analysis, data from 97 studies across 65 sites were synthesized to investigate the effects of warming on soil C inputs, pools, and outputs in boreal and temperate forests. Our results reveal that warming increased aboveground biomass (by 33%) and litterfall (by 15%), while decreasing litter mass remaining (by 7%), with no significant change observed in fine root biomass. Furthermore, warming led to a 9% increase in soil total respiration and a 15% increase in autotrophic respiration, yet had no discernible impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) content. The methods, magnitude, and duration of warming were found to regulate the responses of soil C dynamics. Buried heater warming elicited the most pronounced effects among warming methods. Additionally, soil total respiration exhibited an acclimation response to warming magnitude and duration, while litter decomposition rates increased and SOC content and microbial biomass C decreased with escalating warming magnitude. Moreover, greater soil respiration response occurred in temperate forests than in boreal forests.

Existing studies mostly focus on changes in air temperature and tend to overlook soil temperature; however, changes in extreme heat in air and soil can be inconsistent under global change and water–carbon cycling may be more sensitive to soil condition. In this study, we examine the global pattern of long-term trends in the difference between air temperature and soil temperature (Tsoil − T2m) for the hottest month of the year during the period of 1961–2022. The results show that in certain hotspots, such as the middle and high latitudes of Eurasia, the Mediterranean, and the Western United States, the increasing trend in soil temperature has exceeded the increasing trend in 2 m air temperature during the warm season, implying that the land surface can contribute to the increase in air temperature extreme by releasing more heat than before. Our study suggest that the effect of soil temperature to air temperature is strongly related to the partitioning of surface latent heat, sensible heat (H) and soil heat flux (G). In the hot spots, Tsoil − T2m was significantly positively correlated with H and G while a significant negative correlation was found with evaporative fraction (EF) (p< 0.05), and the significant correlations with G and EF exhibit greater spatial heterogeneity. Moreover, the higher the degree of vegetation cover and soil moisture the smaller the difference between soil and air high temperatures. Therefore, changes in vegetation cover and land use management may play an important role in regulating the range of soil and air temperature differences as well as land-atmosphere coupling effects on heat extreme."

MPs may be quickly eliminated after a brief retention in aquatic animals (such as the digestive tract); thus, understanding the damage caused by MPs during this process and whether the damage can be recovered is important. Here, we proposed the use of visible light imaging to track MPs combined with near-infrared (NIR) imaging to reveal the in situ impacts of MPs. The combination of these two techniques allows for the simultaneous investigation of the localization and functionality of MPs in vivo. We investigated the effects of two types of MPs on zebrafish, microplastic fibers (MFs) and microplastic beads (MBs). The results showed that MPs larger than 10 μm primarily accumulated in the intestines of zebrafish. Both MFs and MBs disrupted the redox balance of the intestine, and the location of the damage was consistent with the heterogeneous accumulation of MPs. MFs caused greater and more difficult-to-recover damage compared to MBs, which was closely related to the slower elimination rate of MFs. Our study highlights the importance of capturing the dynamic toxicological effects of MPs on organisms. Fibrous MPs and spherical MPs clearly had distinct effects on their toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics in fish."

Along with widely reported microcystins, cyanobacteria coproduce other bioactive metabolites; however, information about their dynamics in surface waters is sparse. We investigated dynamics across full bloom successions throughout a five-year lake monitoring campaign (Greifensee, Switzerland) spanning 150 sampling dates. We conducted extensive suspect screening of cyanobacterial metabolites using the database CyanoMetDB. Across all 850 samples, 35 metabolites regularly co-occurred. Microcystins were present in 70% of samples, with [d-Asp3,(E)-Dhb7]MC-RR reaching concentrations of 70 ng/L. Anabaenopeptins, meanwhile, were detected in 95% of all samples with concentrations of Oscillamide Y up to 100-fold higher than microcystins. Based on LC-MS response and frequency, we identified indicator metabolites exclusively produced by one of three cyanobacteria isolated from the lake, these being [d-Asp3,(E)-Dhb7]MC-RR from Planktothrix sp.

In this study, we present an eco-friendly, high-throughput methodology that uses near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) to build a machine-learning model for characterizing the chemical composition of the digestate and a target detection algorithm for identifying FGs. A total of 732 digestate samples were used to develop and validate a model for calculating total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and chemical oxygen demand (COD), which are the chemical indicators of responses to disturbances in the AD process. Among these parameters, good model performance was obtained using the dried digestates data set, where the coefficient of determination (R2test) and the root-mean-square error (RMSEtest) were 0.82 and 1090 mg/L for TOC, and 0.86 and 690 mg/L for TN, respectively. Furthermore, the unique spectral features of the FGs in reactors with a lipid-rich substrate meant that they could also be identified by the HSI system.

A significantly increasing trend in the intensity and frequency of humid‐heat nights has been observed in eastern China from 1961 to 2014. Detection analyses show that the fingerprinting of anthropogenic forcing, in which the greenhouse gas forcing is critical, can be identified for changes in the humid‐heat nights in eastern China. However, the roles of anthropogenic aerosols and external natural forcings cannot be detected, and their effects on the observed changes in humid‐heat nights over eastern China are generally negligible. Under different warming scenarios, there is a projected continuation of increasing intensity and frequency of humid‐heat nights, although the magnitudes are reduced after constraining. In eastern China, the areal mean intensity of humid‐heat nights is projected to increase by approximately 0.9, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5°C (relative to 1995–2014) for 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0°C global warming, while the occurrence of extreme humid‐heat night is 1.1, 1.2, 1.2, and 1.3 times more than the current period.

 The selective cross-coupling of two alkyl electrophiles to construct complex molecules remains a challenge in organic synthesis.1,2 Known reactions are optimized for specific electrophiles and are not amenable to interchangeably varying electrophilic substrates that are sourced from common alkyl building blocks, such as amines, carboxylic acids, and halides.3–5 These limitations restrict the types of alkyl substrates that can be modified and, ultimately, the chemical space that can be explored.6 Here we report a general solution to these limitations that enables a combinatorial approach to alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling reactions. This methodology relies on the discovery of unusually persistent Ni(alkyl) complexes that can be formed directly by oxidative addition of alkyl halides, redox-active esters, or pyridinium salts. The resulting alkyl complexes can be isolated or directly telescoped to couple with a second alkyl electrophile, which represent cross-selective reactions that were previously unknown. The utility of this synthetic capability is showcased in the rapid diversification of amino acids, natural products, pharmaceuticals, and drug-like building blocks by various combinations of dehalogenative, decarboxylative, or deaminative coupling. In addition to a robust scope, this work provides insights into the organometallic chemistry of synthetically relevant Ni(alkyl) complexes through crystallographic analysis, stereochemical probes, and spectroscopic studies."

 Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen. Its RNA genome consists of two negative-sense segments (L and M) with one gene each, and one ambisense segment (S) with two opposing genes separated by the noncoding “intergenic region” (IGR). These vRNAs and the complementary cRNAs are encapsidated by nucleoprotein (N). Using iCLIP2 (individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) to map all N-vRNA and N-cRNA interactions, we detect N coverage along the L and M segments. However, the S segment vRNA and cRNA each contain approximately 100 non-encapsidated nucleotides stretching from the IGR into the 5’-adjacent reading frame. These exposed regions are RNase-sensitive and predicted to form stem-loop structures with the mRNA transcription termination motif positioned near the top. Moreover, optimal S segment transcription and replication requires the entire exposed region rather than only the IGR. Thus, the RVFV S segment contains a central, non-encapsidated RNA region with a functional role. Rift Valley fever virus is a WHO-prioritized zoonotic pathogen.

 Transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers possess large exciton binding energy and a robust valley degree of freedom, making them a viable platform for the development of spintronic devices capable of operating at room temperature. The development of such monolayer TMD-based spintronic devices requires strong spin-dependent interactions and effective spin transport. This can be achieved by employing exciton-polaritons.

We demonstrate spin-anisotropic polariton nonlinear interactions in a WS2 superlattice at room temperature. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize these spin-dependent interactions to implement different spin switch geometries at ambient conditions, which show intrinsic sub-picosecond switching time and small footprint.

 Entangled photon-pair sources are at the core of quantum applications like quantum key distribution, sensing, and imaging. Operation in space-limited and adverse environments such as in satellite-based and mobile communication requires robust entanglement sources with minimal size and weight requirements. Here, we meet this challenge by realizing a cubic micrometer scale entangled photon-pair source in a 3R-stacked transition metal dichalcogenide crystal. Its crystal symmetry enables the generation of polarization-entangled Bell states without additional components and provides tunability by simple control of the pump polarization. Remarkably, generation rate and state tuning are decoupled, leading to equal generation efficiency and no loss of entanglement. Combining transition metal dichalcogenides with monolithic cavities and integrated photonic circuitry or using quasi-phasematching opens the gate towards ultrasmall and scalable quantum devices.

 Resistance to stress is a key determinant for mammalian functioning. While many studies have revealed neural circuits and substrates responsible for initiating and mediating stress responses, little is known about how the brain resists to stress and prevents overreactions. Here, we identified a previously uncharacterized neuropeptide Y (NPY) neuronal population in the dorsal raphe nucleus and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray region (DRN/vlPAG) with anxiolytic effects in male mice. NPYDRN/vlPAG neurons are rapidly activated by various stressful stimuli. Inhibiting these neurons exacerbated hypophagic and anxiety responses during stress, while activation significantly ameliorates acute stress-induced hypophagia and anxiety levels and transmits positive valence. Furthermore, NPYDRN/vlPAG neurons exert differential but synergic anxiolytic effects via inhibitory projections to the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) and the lateral hypothalamic area (LH). Together, our findings reveal a feedforward inhibition neural mechanism underlying stress resistance and suggest NPYDRN/vlPAG neurons as a potential therapeutic target for stress-related disorders.

Contacts of the forty-three aerosol culture-positive participants (30%) are more likely to have a positive interferon-gamma release assay (85% vs 53%, P = 0.006) and higher median IFNγ level (P < 0.001, 4.28 IU/ml (1.77-5.91) vs. 0.71 (0.01-3.56)) compared to aerosol culture-negative individuals. We find that higher bacillary burden, younger age, larger mean upper arm circumference, and host inflammatory profiles, including elevated serum C-reactive protein and lower plasma TNF levels, associate with positive cough aerosol cultures. Notably, we find pre-treatment whole blood transcriptional profiles associate with aerosol culture status, independent of bacillary load. These findings suggest that tuberculosis infectiousness is associated with epidemiologic characteristics and inflammatory signatures and that these features may identify highly infectious persons. Using cough-generated aerosol cultures, authors probe the inflammatory markers and epidemiological characteristics of individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis, in association with infection state."

 Converting solar energy into fuels is pursued as an attractive route to reduce dependence on fossil fuel. In this context, photothermal catalysis is a very promising approach through converting photons into heat to drive catalytic reactions. There are mainly three key factors that govern the photothermal catalysis performance: maximized solar absorption, minimized thermal emission and excellent catalytic property of catalyst. However, the previous research has focused on improving solar absorption and catalytic performance of catalyst, largely neglected the optimization of thermal emission. Here, we demonstrate an optically selective catalyst based Ti3C2Tx Janus design, that enables minimized thermal emission, maximized solar absorption and good catalytic activity simultaneously, thereby achieving excellent photothermal catalytic performance. When applied to Sabatier reaction and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) as demonstrations, we obtain an approximately 300% increase in catalytic yield through reducing the thermal emission of catalyst by ~70% under the same irradiation intensity. It is worth noting that the CO2 methanation yield reaches 3317.2 mmol gRu−1 h−1 at light power of 2 W cm−2, setting a performance record among catalysts without active supports. We expect that this design opens up a new pathway for the development of high-performance photothermal catalysts.

 Realizing a sensitive photon-number-dependent phase shift on a light beam is required both in classical and quantum photonics.

Nonlinear phase-shifts require efficient light-matter interaction, and recently quantum dots coupled to nanophotonic devices have enabled near-deterministic single-photon coupling. We experimentally realize an optical phase shift of 0.19π ± 0.03 radians ( ≈ 34 degrees) using a weak coherent state interacting with a single quantum dot in a planar nanophotonic waveguide. The phase shift is probed by interferometric measurements of the light scattered from the quantum dot in the waveguide.

 Ageing is the accumulation of changes and decline of function of organisms over time. The concept and biomarkers of biological age have been established, notably DNA methylation-based clocks. The emergence of single-cell DNA methylation profiling methods opens the possibility of studying the biological age of individual cells.

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a subtle but informative probe of plant photosynthesis. Quantifying the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of SIF benefits a better understanding of photosynthesis variations over heterogeneous canopies. Although radiative transfer models (RTMs) provide a solid theoretical basis for simulating the 3D SIF distribution, most RTMs use virtual scenes with complex reconstruction processes. This study aims to develop a 3D SIF simulation model (FluorLiDAR) directly driven by terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data using leaf and canopy RTMs, including a 3D PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) simulation model, the Fluspect model, the atmosphere radiative transfer module in SCOPE, and the multiple scattering coefficients of sunlit and shaded leaves from the 4-scale model. The results show that (1) the simulated and measured SIF patterns were consistent, with R2 (RMSE) values of 0.73 (0.17 mW/nm/m2/sr) and 0.76 (0.12 mW/nm/m2/sr) for 1-min sampling and 10-min averages, respectively. Moreover, the R2 between FluorLiDAR and the DART simulation reached 0.94. The R2 of FluorLiDAR and DART were both higher than 1D mSCOPE using every 10-min sampling data. (2) Point density, denoted by average NPD (nearest point distance), influenced the performance of our model mainly when it was smaller than 0.1 m. Chlorophyll content had less influence on the model accuracy (R2 and rRMSE), and the bias between simulation and measurement decreased as chlorophyll content increased. (3) The simulated 3D SIF distribution pattern closely resembled PAR within the canopy. Besides, FluorLiDAR can simulate the hot spot effect like DART and mSCOPE though the effect was not as obvious as the other two models. This study highlights the potential of a LiDAR-driven SIF model for 3D SIF simulation over a heterogeneous canopy, which may benefit the understanding of the structural impacts on forest photosynthesis in real forest scenes."

 We developed the SCARF (Spatial Mismatch and Systematic Prediction Error Corrected cAscade Random Forests) algorithm for continuous prediction of biomass dynamics using machine learning and Landsat Time Series (LTS). Our approach addresses the challenges posed by the cloudy subtropical forests in southern China, where monitoring biomass dynamics is notoriously difficult. To derive spectral-temporal features from the LTS, we applied the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014). Subsequently, we employed the cascade random forests machine learning algorithm for biomass prediction. This new approach corrects the spatial mismatch effects between plots and Landsat pixels as well as the systematic prediction errors in the machine learning model. As a result, it substantially enhances biomass prediction accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.83 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.27 Mg ha-1. In comparison, the commonly used random forests approach yields an R2 of 0.47 and RMSE of 8.52 Mg ha-1. Additionally, it provides reliable spatial prediction beyond the model-training area, achieving an R2 of 0.79 and an RMSE of 6.62 Mg ha-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that modeling five different forest age groups separately further improves prediction accuracies, resulting in an increased R2 of 0.87 and a reduced RMSE of 3.65 Mg ha-1. A comparison of the allometric model prediction from the field plots and those from the SCARF model revealed a strong agreement, indicating that this approach can provide a temporally continuous prediction of biomass dynamics. Our study presents a robust method for continuous, reliable, and explicit spatiotemporal prediction of biomass dynamics in cloudy subtropical forests using LTS."

 Phase unwrapping is the process of retrieving the true phase values from observed wrapped phases by adding the correct multiples of 2π. This process is crucial in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry, and numerous studies have aimed to enhance its performance. This study explored phase unwrapping using a modified U-Net regression model by optimizing both the network structure and training data. For network structure optimization, the study first compared model performance based on the size ratio of the lowest feature maps, determined by the number of pooling layers, to the size of convolutional kernels. A multi-kernel U-Net structure was developed to ensure robustness against variations in phase noise and gradient, compared to a standard single-kernel U-Net. Regarding the training data, data augmentation was implemented to address imbalances and better represent the local noise characteristics found in actual SAR interferograms. The training data was simulated to include local noise effects based on coherence measurements from real SAR data, as well as simple noise used for benchmarking the unwrapping performance with different training datasets. The results indicated that when the convolutional kernel size is smaller than the feature map size at the lowest layer, increasing the number of pooling layers leads to improvements in unwrapping performance. Conversely, performance decreased when the feature map size at the lowest layers was smaller than the convolutional kernel size. Specifically, the single-kernel U-Net with six pooling layers and the multi-kernel U-Net with five pooling layers exhibited the best unwrapping performance. Considering both simulated and real synthetic aperture radar interferogram data, the mean absolute errors for the single- and multi-kernel U-Net trained with simple noise were approximately 0.235 and 0.254, respectively. In contrast, for models trained with locally variable noise simulation data, the MAEs dropped to about 0.033 and 0.032, showing an improvement by approximately eightfold over models trained with simple noise. For real synthetic aperture radar interferograms, the mean absolute errors were 0.542 (single-kernel U-Net trained using simple noise), 0.592 (multi-kernel U-Net trained using simple noise), 0.542 (single-kernel U-Net trained using local noise), and 0.445 (proposed), respectively, underscoring the significant impact of training data on unwrapping performance. The study also evaluated the performance of the statistical-cost, network-flow algorithm for phase unwrapping (SNAPHU), obtaining mean absolute errors of about 0.043 for simulation data and 0.861 for real SAR data. Consequently, the multi-kernel model trained with locally different noise simulation data demonstrated roughly twice the performance compared to the traditional phase unwrapping method."

 Detailed population maps play an important role in diverse fields ranging from humanitarian action to urban planning. Generating such maps in a timely and scalable manner presents a challenge, especially in data-scarce regions. To address it we have developed Popcorn, a population mapping method whose only inputs are free, globally available satellite images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2; and a small number of aggregate population counts over coarse census districts for calibration. Despite the minimal data requirements our approach surpasses the mapping accuracy of existing schemes, including several that rely on building footprints derived from high-resolution imagery. E.g., we were able to produce population maps for Rwanda with 100m GSD based on less than 400 regional census counts. In Kigali, those maps reach an R2 score of 66% w.r.t. a ground truth reference map, with an average error of only ±10 inhabitants/ha. Conveniently, Popcorn retrieves explicit maps of built-up areas and local building occupancy rates, making the mapping process interpretable and offering additional insights, for instance about the distribution of built-up, but unpopulated areas, e.g., industrial warehouses. With our work we aim to democratize access to up-to-date and high-resolution population maps, recognizing that some regions faced with particularly strong population dynamics may lack the resources for costly micro-census campaigns.

Further challenges to extensive livestock systems may arise from changes in climate and the global economy (particularly variation in prices for livestock and carbon). However, significant potential exists for both mitigating these impacts and adapting to change via altering stocking rates, managing fire, and supplementing cattle diets to reduce methane emissions. We developed an integrated, spatio-temporal modelling approach to assess the effectiveness of these options for land management in northern Australia’s tropical savanna under different global change scenarios. Performance was measured against a range of sustainability indicators, including environmental (GHG emissions, biodiversity, water intake, and land condition) and agricultural (profit, beef production) outcomes. Our model shows that maintaining historical stocking rates is not environmentally sustainable due to the accelerated land degradation exacerbated by a changing climate. However, planned early dry season burning substantially reduced emissions, and in our simulations was profitable under all global change scenarios that included a carbon price. Overall, the balance between production and environmental outcomes could be improved by stocking below modelled carrying capacity and implementing fire management. This management scenario was the most profitable (more than double the profit from maintaining historical stocking rates), prevented land degradation, and reduced GHG emissions by 23%. By integrating the cumulative impacts of climate change, external economic drivers, and management actions across a range of sustainability indicators, we show that the future of rangelands in Australia’s savannas has the potential to balance livestock production and environmental outcomes."

To address this knowledge gap, photodegradation experiments were conducted on three prevalent MFs: polyester (POL), nylon (NYL), and acrylic (ACR), to elucidate their degradation pathways, changes in surface morphology and polymer structure, and chemical and colloidal characterization of weathering products during photochemical degradation of MFs. The results showed that concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (DOM), and fluorescent components consistently increased during weathering, exhibiting a continuous release of DOM. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed changes in the surface morphology and polymer spectra of the MFs. During the weathering experiments, DOM aromaticity (SUVA254) decreased, while spectral slope increased, indicating concurrent DOM release and degradation of aromatic components. The released DOM or nanoplastics were negatively charged with sizes between 128 and 374 nm. The production rate constants of DOM or the photochemical reactivity of MFs followed the order ACR > NYL ≥ POL, consistent with their differences in chemical structures.

Here, authors show that ferroptosis, a cell death modality driven by lipid peroxidation, is required to be suppressed by vitamin A or antioxidants to ensure proper neuronal development. 
 The development of functional neurons is a complex orchestration of multiple signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. Because the balance of antioxidants is important for neuronal survival and development, we hypothesized that ferroptosis must be suppressed to gain neurons. We find that removal of antioxidants diminishes neuronal development and laminar organization of cortical organoids, which is fully restored when ferroptosis is inhibited by ferrostatin-1 or when neuronal differentiation occurs in the presence of vitamin A. Furthermore, iron-overload-induced developmental growth defects in C. elegans are ameliorated by vitamin E and A. We determine that all-trans retinoic acid activates the Retinoic Acid Receptor, which orchestrates the expression of anti-ferroptotic genes. In contrast, retinal and retinol show radical-trapping antioxidant activity. Together, our study reveals an unexpected function of vitamin A in coordinating the expression of essential cellular gatekeepers of ferroptosis, and demonstrates that suppression of ferroptosis by radical-trapping antioxidants or by vitamin A is required to obtain mature neurons and proper laminar organization in cortical organoids.

 Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have become pivotal in achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and organic solar cells (OSCs) by significantly minimizing interfacial energy losses. In this study, we propose a co-adsorb (CA) strategy employing a novel small molecule, 2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)isonicotinic acid (PyCA-3F), introducing at the buried interface between 2PACz and the perovskite/organic layers. This approach effectively diminishes 2PACz’s aggregation, enhancing surface smoothness and increasing work function for the modified SAM layer, thereby providing a flattened buried interface with a favorable heterointerface for perovskite. The resultant improvements in crystallinity, minimized trap states, and augmented hole extraction and transfer capabilities have propelled power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond 25% in PSCs with a p-i-n structure (certified at 24.68%). OSCs employing the CA strategy achieve remarkable PCEs of 19.51% based on PM1:PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 photoactive system. Notably, universal improvements have also been achieved for the other two popular OSC systems. After a 1000-hour maximal power point tracking, the encapsulated PSCs and OSCs retain approximately 90% and 80% of their initial PCEs, respectively. This work introduces a facile, rational, and effective method to enhance the performance of SAMs, realizing efficiency breakthroughs in both PSCs and OSCs with a favorable p-i-n device structure, along with improved operational stability.

 The outer membrane is a formidable barrier that protects Gram-negative bacteria against environmental threats. Its integrity requires the correct folding and insertion of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) by the membrane-embedded β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM). Unfolded OMPs are delivered to BAM by the periplasmic chaperone SurA, but how SurA and BAM work together to ensure successful OMP delivery and folding remains unclear. Here, guided by AlphaFold2 models, we use disulphide bond engineering in an attempt to trap SurA in the act of OMP delivery to BAM, and solve cryoEM structures of a series of complexes. The results suggest that SurA binds BAM at its soluble POTRA-1 domain, which may trigger conformational changes in both BAM and SurA that enable transfer of the unfolded OMP to the BAM lateral gate for insertion into the outer membrane. Mutations that disrupt the interaction between BAM and SurA result in outer membrane assembly defects, supporting the key role of SurA in outer membrane biogenesis.

 A method for the characterization of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) based on small signal analysis is presented that allows to determine the electronic mobility as a function of continuous gate potential using a standard two-channel AC potentiostat. Vector analysis in the frequency domain allows to exclude parasitic components in both ionic and electronic conduction regardless of film thickness, thus resulting in a standard deviation as low as 4%. Besides the electronic mobility, small signal analysis of OECTs also provides information about a wide range of other parameters including the conductance, transconductance, conductivity and volumetric capacitance through a single measurement. General applicability of small signal analysis is demonstrated by characterizing devices based on n-type, p-type, and ambipolar materials operating in accumulation or depletion modes.

 Flood emergency mapping is essential for flood management, often requiring near real-time extraction of large-scale flood extents by combining pre- and post-event multi-source remote sensing images. Pre-event optical imagery delineates the normal water extent, providing a benchmark for estimation of post-flood changes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery provides rapid and accurate interpretation of flood inundation extent during the rainy period. Post-classification comparison is one of the fundamental methods for flood mapping of multi-source imagery, as the image characteristics of SAR and optical imagery are inherently different. However, the accuracy of flood mapping depends on the accuracy of water body delineation from single temporal imagery, which can lead to error propagation in flood extent determination. Change detection methods can extract flood extent directly from pre- and post-event imagery, but the models need to learn a consistent flood feature description between optical and SAR imagery from a limited flood dataset. Here, we propose an automatic method for flood inundation extent extraction using pre- and post-event multi-source imagery that requires only a small number of pseudo-change labels. The methodology adopts a pseudo-Siamese network framework as a Heterogeneous - Flood Inundation Extraction Network (H-FIENet), to detect flood extent between the pre‐ and post-event heterogeneous images. Spatially inconsistent multi-source pre- and post-event imagery was used to create a pseudo flood dataset, and this dataset was used to transfer water body feature knowledge from the pre-trained model to the flood extraction model using a cross-task knowledge transfer strategy. Pre- and post-event images from different satellite sources and different flood scenarios were used to evaluate the performance of H-FIENet. We found that: (1) The methodology produced an overall accuracy of over 0.94 for flood inundation extraction from multi-source heterogeneous pre- and post-event imagery. (2) H-FIENet can detect both expansion and recession of the flood extent using any dual-temporal imagery. Our work makes it possible to automate time-series flood monitoring from multi-source remote sensing imagery."

This meta-analysis explores whether the relationship between PEB and well-being depends on the environmental impact of the performed PEB. Overall, the paper finds a small but significant positive relation between PEB and well-being. When accounting for the environmental impact of the PEB, however, the positive relationship only remains for low-impact PEB. The meta-analysis does not provide any evidence that engaging in high-impact PEB relates to well-being.

To better simulate the future and past evolution of coral reefs and their effect on the global carbon cycle, hence on atmospheric CO2 concentration, it is necessary to include coral reefs within a climate model. Here we describe the inclusion of coral reef carbonate production in a carbon–climate model and its validation in comparison to existing modern data. 
 Coral reef development is intricately linked to both climate and the concentration of atmospheric CO2, specifically through temperature and carbonate chemistry in the upper ocean. In turn, the calcification of corals modifies the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity in the ocean, impacting air–sea gas exchange, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and ultimately the climate. This feedback between atmospheric conditions and coral biogeochemistry can only be accounted for with a coupled coral–carbon–climate model. Here we present the implementation of a coral reef calcification module into an Earth system model. Simulated coral reef production of the calcium carbonate mineral aragonite depends on photosynthetically active radiation, nutrient concentrations, salinity, temperature, and the aragonite saturation state. An ensemble of 210 parameter perturbation simulations was performed to identify carbonate production parameter values that optimize the simulated distribution of coral reefs and associated carbonate production. The tuned model simulates the presence of coral reefs and regional-to-global carbonate production values in good agreement with data-based estimates, despite some limitations due to the imperfect simulation of climatic and biogeochemical fields driving the simulation of coral reef development. When used in association with methods accounting for bathymetry changes resulting from different sea levels, the model enables assessment of past and future coral–climate coupling on seasonal to millennial timescales, highlighting how climatic trends and variability may affect reef development and the resulting climate–carbon feedback."

This work provides a novel flow model that focuses on simple relations while still encapsulating the significant behaviour. The model is applied to reconstruct two catastrophic powder snow avalanche events in Austria. 
 Numerical simulations have become an important tool for the estimation and mitigation of gravitational mass flows, such as avalanches, landslides, pyroclastic flows, and turbidity currents. Depth integration stands as a pivotal concept in rendering numerical models applicable to real-world scenarios, as it provides the required efficiency and a streamlined workflow for geographic information systems. In recent years, a large number of flow models were developed following the idea of depth integration, thereby enlarging the applicability and reliability of this family of process models substantially. It has been previously shown that the finite area method of OpenFOAM® can be utilized to express and solve the basic depth-integrated models representing incompressible dense flows. In this article, previous work (Rauter et al., 2018) is extended beyond the dense-flow regime to account for suspended particle flows, such as turbidity currents and powder snow avalanches. A novel coupling mechanism is introduced to enhance the simulation capabilities for mixed-snow avalanches. Further, we will give an updated description of the revised computational framework, its integration into OpenFOAM, and interfaces to geographic information systems. This work aims to provide practitioners and scientists with an open-source tool that facilitates transparency and reproducibility and that can be easily applied to real-world scenarios.

 This study focuses on the performance of the elastic–viscous–plastic (EVP) dynamical solver within the sea ice model, CICE v6.5.1. The study has been conducted in two steps. First, the standard EVP solver was extracted from CICE for experiments with refactored versions, which are used for performance testing. Second, one refactored version was integrated and tested in the full CICE model to demonstrate that the new algorithms do not significantly impact the physical results.The study reveals two dominant bottlenecks,  namely (1) the number of Message Parsing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) synchronization points required for halo exchanges during each time step combined with the irregular domain of active sea ice points and (2) the lack of single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) code generation.The standard EVP solver has been refactored based on two generic patterns. The first pattern exposes how general finite differences on masked multi-dimensional arrays can be expressed in order to produce significantly better code generation by changing the memory access pattern from random access to direct access. The second pattern takes an alternative approach to handle static grid properties.The measured single-core performance improvement is more than a factor of 5 compared to the standard implementation. The refactored implementation of strong scales on the Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors series node until the available bandwidth of the node is used. For the Intel® Xeon® CPU Max series, there is sufficient bandwidth to allow the strong scaling to continue for all the cores on the node, resulting in a single-node improvement factor of 35 over the standard implementation.

Herein, protonated sulfate (−HSO4) supported on vanadium-titanium catalysts via a preoccupied anchoring strategy are designed to prevent polychlorinated species and alleviate NH3 adsorption for the multipollutant control. The obtained catalysts with −HSO4 modification achieve an excellent NOx and CB conversion with turnover frequency values of ∼ 3.63 and 17.7 times higher than those of the pristine, respectively. The protonated sulfate promotes the formation of polymeric vanadyl with a higher chemical state and d-band center of V. The modulated catalysts not only substantially alleviate the competitive adsorption of multipollutant via the “V 3d–O 2p–S 3p” network, but also distinctly strengthen the Brønsted acid sites. Besides, the introduced proton donor of the −HSO4 connecting polymeric structure could markedly reduce the reaction barrier of breaking the C–Cl bond.

 Gold nuggets occur predominantly in quartz veins, and the current paradigm posits that gold precipitates from dilute (<1 mg kg−1 gold), hot, water ± carbon dioxide-rich fluids owing to changes in temperature, pressure and/or fluid chemistry. However, the widespread occurrence of large gold nuggets is at odds with the dilute nature of these fluids and the chemical inertness of quartz. Quartz is the only abundant piezoelectric mineral on Earth, and the cyclical nature of earthquake activity that drives orogenic gold deposit formation means that quartz crystals in veins will experience thousands of episodes of deviatoric stress. Here we use quartz deformation experiments and piezoelectric modelling to investigate whether piezoelectric discharge from quartz can explain the ubiquitous gold–quartz association and the formation of gold nuggets. We find that stress on quartz crystals can generate enough voltage to electrochemically deposit aqueous gold from solution as well as accumulate gold nanoparticles. Nucleation of gold via piezo-driven reactions is rate-limiting because quartz is an insulator; however, since gold is a conductor, our results show that existing gold grains are the focus of ongoing growth. We suggest this mechanism can help explain the creation of large nuggets and the commonly observed highly interconnected gold networks within quartz vein fractures.

 Thermoelectrics converting heat and electricity directly attract broad attentions. To enhance the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, one of the key points is to decouple the carrier-phonon transport. Here, we propose an entropy engineering strategy to realize the carrier-phonon decoupling in the typical SrTiO3-based perovskite thermoelectrics. By high-entropy design, the lattice thermal conductivity could be reduced nearly to the amorphous limit, 1.25 W m−1 K−1. Simultaneously, entropy engineering can tune the Ti displacement, improving the weighted mobility to 65 cm2 V−1 s−1. Such carrier-phonon decoupling behaviors enable the greatly enhanced μW/κL of ~5.2 × 103 cm3 K J−1 V−1. The measured maximum zT of 0.24 at 488 K and the estimated zT of ~0.8 at 1173 K in (Sr0.2Ba0.2Ca0.2Pb0.2La0.2)TiO3 film are among the best of n-type thermoelectric oxides.

 The discovery of valuable minerals in the mineral-abundant eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo can stimulate extensive migration into remote areas of the Congo Basin rainforest. Despite the widespread practice of artisanal mining, its role in the ongoing deforestation has not received adequate attention. Using difference-in-differences estimation, we show that artisanal mining triggers deforestation at least 5 km from mining sites. Within this distance, the onset of mining causes an additional 4 percentage points of forest loss after 10 years. In total, the indirect deforestation caused by mining through the expansion of other land uses is 28 times larger than the forest area directly cleared for mining. Most of this loss is caused by increased farming around mines, followed by forest cleared for settlements. These indirect effects reveal a much larger role played by artisanal mining in deforestation dynamics than previously assumed and explain at least 6.6% of the total deforestation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

 Paleotsunami deposits provide a compelling record of these events, including valuable insights into their recurrence and associated magnitudes. However, precisely determining the sources of these sedimentary evidence remains challenging due to the complex interplay between hydrodynamic and geological phenomena and the intricacy of the processes responsible for forming and preserving tsunami deposits. Here, we introduce a novel approach that employs Bayesian inference methods to divide the complex tsunami process into segments and independently handle uncertainties, thereby enabling more precise and comprehensive modelling of the sources. We provide a list of potential earthquake scenarios with different likelihoods instead of a single best fit. Based on this method, we calculated that the source of the 869 Jogan earthquake had a magnitude ranging from Moment Magnitude 8.84 to 9.1 (within one standard deviation) with different slip distributions along the Japan Trench. Our results reaffirm that the Jogan event had a similar order of magnitude to the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami and enhanced the applicability of paleotsunami deposits to hazard assessment.

 Some of the largest magmatic-hydrothermal copper ore deposits and deposit clusters are associated with arc-oblique fault systems. Whether this structural context impacts the geochemistry of hydrothermal fluids, including their copper contents, remains unknown. Here, we investigate the copper concentration and helium isotope signature of geothermal fluids as modern analogs of hydrothermal ore deposits in the Andes of central-southern Chile. We show that fault systems broadly parallel to the regional stress field facilitate the early release of fluids from deep primitive magmas. By contrast, fault systems oblique to the regional stress field prevent the early escape of fluids and promote magmatic enrichment in copper, volatiles, and ligands, enhancing the potential to form copper deposits. We conclude that the orientation of fault systems actively influences the copper budget of ascending hydrothermal fluids, explaining the contrasting distribution of metals along distinct structures often observed in porphyry-epithermal systems and other types of magmatic-hydrothermal deposits.

 In subduction zones, water expelled from the subducting slab is believed to be involved in seismic activity. However, little is known about its quantity and flow processes. Here, we show that the Arima hot springs in western Japan contain high concentrations of water derived from the subducting Philippine Sea slab. A long-term record spanning over half a century reveals that the fraction of slab-derived water exhibited a temporary surge in the year preceding and/or subsequent years of the 1995 Kobe (Hyogo-ken Nanbu) earthquake. In total, an estimated 2.6–4.2 × 105 cubic meters of slab-derived water was introduced in conjunction with the earthquake. We infer that the earthquake was triggered by a flood-like release of water from the slab or by the bursting of clogged flow paths to the hypocenter.

 The North Pacific Ocean plays a pivotal role as a carbon sink within the global carbon cycle. However, a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon dioxide concentration and its determinants in this domain remains elusive due to its vast dimensions and the intricacies of influencing factors, with previous research on carbon dioxide partial pressure in the North Pacific Ocean also being relatively scarce. While prevalent machine learning methodologies have been extensively applied to predict the partial pressure of ocean carbon dioxide (pCO2), their limited interpretability has impeded substantial progress in elucidating the underlying mechanisms. This study introduces a gridded spatiotemporal neural network weighted regression (GSTNNWR) model to illuminate temporal and spatial relationships among relevant environmental variables and pCO2. The GSTNNWR model achieves high-precision and high-resolution forecasts of surface pCO2 in the North Pacific Ocean, demonstrating commendable performance (R2 = 0.863 and RMSE=15.123 µatm). Simultaneously, we obtain a quantitative characterization of how various environmental factors influence pCO2 across different temporal and spatial scales. Results show a dominant positive effect of temperature on the pCO2, with an averaged normalized coefficient of 0.28, and variability in the effects of chlorophyll and salinity on the pCO2 at different spatial and temporal locations and temperatures, whose average normalized coefficients are −0.10 and −0.04.The findings of our study will provide insights into the mechanisms and interactions within the North Pacific carbon cycle, contributing to a better understanding of ocean carbon sink formation and the dynamic regulation of the North Pacific carbon cycle."

Analyses of the interactions between flood risks and armed conflict are essential for developing effective policies and strategies to address both challenges. This study aims to develop conceptual and analytical socio-hydrological frameworks for assessing how armed conflict can impact flood risks. The frameworks postulate a link between armed conflict and flood vulnerability, given that armed conflict creates unique challenges that exacerbate the effects of floods. Our conceptual framework identifies routes through which armed conflict affects vulnerability to floods, such as damage to infrastructure, population displacement and density, weak governance, and less awareness, resulting in lower resilience, higher susceptibility, and increased flood vulnerability and risk. Our analytical framework uses flood modeling to evaluate flood hazards and incorporates spatial data related to armed conflict zones, nighttime light, population classification by age, land price, land cover, and rural/urban areas classification. We take Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan, as a case study in view of its armed conflict that erupted in 2023. By highlighting the linkages between armed conflict and flood risk, this study contributes to conceptualizing the broader interlinkages between conflict and environmental systems. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating conflict analysis with disaster risk management strategies. We encourage collaboration between humanitarian, environmental, and security sectors to improve preparedness, response, and resilience in conflict-affected regions. While our analysis for Khartoum is based on conflict zones in the early stages of the conflict and uses simple estimates for conflict vulnerability contribution, the proposed frameworks provide groundwork for assessing changes in flood risk in Sudan and other conflict regions around the world."

Although market access contributes to diet intake, consumer behavior determines food acquisition practices yet is often neglected in food environment research. Implementing sustainable food system transformations in climate-vulnerable, trade-dependent settings requires effective integration of both geographic and experienced-based measures of access. This study in the Galápagos Islands (i) develops measures for geographic and experience-based food environments (EFEs) and (ii) links diet outcomes to these food environment measures independently and when interacted. Cross-sectional household data including diet recalls come from 388 participants in the Healthy Family Study from San Cristóbal Island, Galápagos in 2018. Geocoded market inventory and price data were obtained in 2018 using the Nutritional Environment Measurement Survey for Stores (n = 60). Geographic food environments were created from market scores and distribution. EFEs were based on factor analyzed consumer behavior strategies. Diet quality was defined using the global dietary recommendations score. Adjusted linear regressions tested the relationships between diet and food environment measures and included sociodemographic covariates. Interactions between geographic and EFEs were tested. This study showed that higher prioritization of convenience when food shopping was associated with lower healthy food intake. However, the relationship between food environment measures and diet is strongly modified by consumer behavior. For convenience-prioritizing households, the nearest market proved most associated with healthy diet outcomes. For households with a food-driven purchasing strategy, the preferred market was most associated with healthy diet outcomes. These findings show that market inventory can be healthful or deleterious to diets, depending on how individuals navigate their food environments. Empirical measures of food access that neglect to consider consumer behavior may fail to capture realistic representations of food environment and diet relationships. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring food system changes to incorporate context-specific consumer behavior."

Confounding non-stationary processes of climate change and global warming and their negative impacts can make hazards more complex and severe, particularly in Vietnam. Such complexity necessitates a study that can synthesize multi-dimensional natural-human factors in disaster risk assessments. This synthesis study aims to assess and monitor climate change and land-cover/land-use change impacts on flood and landslide hazards in Vietnam’s Gianh River basin. Three Deep Neural Network (DNN) and optimization algorithms, including the Adam, Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA), and Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (DMOA) were used to determine the regions with the probability of the occurrence of flood and landslide and their combination. All efficiently evaluated hazard susceptibility based on a synthesis analysis encompassing 14 natural and anthropogenic conditioning factors. Of the three, the Deep Neural Network (DNN)-DMOA model performed the best for both flood and landslide susceptibility, with area-under-curve values of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively, followed by DNN-TSA (0.97 for flood, 0.92 for landslide), and DNN-Adam (0.96 for flood, 0.89 for landslide). Although the area affected by flooding is predicted to decrease, the overall trend for total hazard-prone areas increases over 2005–2050 due to the more extensive area affected by landslides. This study develop and demonstrate a robust framework to monitor multi-hazard susceptibility, taking into account the changes in climate and land-use influence the occurrence of multiple hazards. Based on the quantitative assessment, these findings can help policymakers understand and identify confounding hazard issues to develop proactive land-management approaches in effective mitigation or adaptation strategies that are spatially and temporally appropriate."

 The ever-improving performances of physics-based simulations and the rapid developments of deep learning are offering new perspectives to study earthquake-induced ground motion. Due to the large amount of data required to train deep neural networks, applications have so far been limited to recorded data or two-dimensional (2D) simulations.

Each domain is parametrized by a different geological model built from a random arrangement of layers augmented by random fields that represent heterogeneities. Elastic waves originate from a randomly located pointwise source parametrized by a random moment tensor. For each simulation, ground motion is synthesized at the surface by a grid of virtual sensors. The high frequency of waveforms (fmax=5 Hz) allows for extensive analyses of surface ground motion.Existing and foreseen applications range from statistical analyses of the ground motion variability and machine learning methods on geological models to deep-learning-based predictions of ground motion that depend on 3D heterogeneous geologies and source properties.

To address this, the centrifugal force was innovatively adopted to enhance the coalescence and separation of immiscible fine droplets within the biphasic solvent. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that centrifugal phase-splitting shows outstanding separation efficiency (>95%) and excellent applicability for various solvents. Correlation analysis reveals a strong relationship between the rich phase’s viscosity, lean phase’s residual CO2, and the phase separation efficiency. The time-profile behavior of immiscible droplets, observed through microscope images of phase-splitting, enables the estimation of the growth and coalescence rates of the discrete phase. Industrial-scale process simulation for technical and economic analysis confirms that the total capture cost ($ 42.5/t CO2) can be reduced by ∼22% with the use of biphasic solvents and a centrifugal separator compared to conventional methods.

This membrane features a selective polypiperazine (PIP) layer functionalized with amino-containing quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) through an in situ interfacial polycondensation reaction. Our investigation demonstrated that precise QAC functionalization enabled the construction of the selective PA layer with increased surface area, enhanced microporosity, stronger electronegativity, and reduced thickness compared to the control PIP membrane. As a result, the QAC NF membrane exhibited an approximately 51% increase in water permeance compared to the control PIP membrane, while achieving superior retention capabilities for divalent salts (>99%) and emerging organic contaminants (>90%). Furthermore, the incorporation of QACs into the PIP selective layer was proved to be effective in mitigating mineral scaling by allowing selective passage of scale-forming cations, while simultaneously exhibiting strong antimicrobial properties to combat biofouling. The in situ QAC incorporation strategy presented in this study provides valuable guidelines for the fit-for-purpose design of the selective PA layer, which is crucial for the development of high-performance NF membranes for efficient water purification."

Here, under an ambient temperature range from 10 to 25 °C, we fabricated polyamide layers on a free interface between the aqueous phase and organic phase and on the traditional PES support interface, respectively. We observed polyamide morphologies using the infrared thermal imager for the free interface and SEM for the support interface, respectively. We found that a minor change in ambient temperature could switch the polyamide from a ridge-like to bubble-like morphology. Moreover, with increasing the temperature of the fabrication process from 10 to 25 °C, the pure water permeance exhibited a decline of 38.94%, and the monodivalent selectivity presented a 12.04-fold increase. These findings highlight that the daily ambient temperature of membrane-based enterprises should be fully considered and reasonably used to decrease the production costs in both initial site selection and membrane production stability.

We used an approach based on the Topographic Hydrological model (TOPMODEL) and soil liquid water content projections from 14 models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Our analysis reveals a consistent decrease in wetlands extent in the Mediterranean, Central America, and northern South America, with a substantial loss of 28% in the western Amazon Basin for the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) under the SSP370 scenario. Conversely, Central Africa exhibits an increase in wetlands extent, except in the Congo Basin. Nevertheless, most of the areas studied (80%) present uncertain results, due to conflicting projections of changes between the models. Notably, we show that there is significant uncertainty among CMIP6 models regarding liquid soil water content in high latitudes. By narrowing our focus to 10 models, which seem to better represent the thawing of permafrost, we obtain a better inter‐model agreement. We then find a modest declines in the overall global area (<5%), but an average loss of 13% beyond 50°N. Specific areas like the Hudson Bay Lowlands experiencing a 21% decrease and the Western Siberian Lowlands a 15% decrease."

Schillerberg;Di Tian,"Global Assessment of Compound Climate Extremes and Exposures of Population, Agriculture, and Forest Lands Under Two Climate Scenarios","Climate change is expected to increase the global occurrence and intensity of heatwaves, extreme precipitation, and flash droughts. However, it is not well understood how the compound heatwave, extreme precipitation, and flash drought events will likely change, and how global population, agriculture, and forest will likely be exposed to these compound events under future climate change scenarios. This research uses eight CMIP6 climate models to assess the current and future global compound climate extreme events, as well as population, agriculture, and forestry exposures to these events, under two climate scenarios, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), SSP1‐2.6 and SSP5‐8.5 for three time periods: early‐, mid‐, and late‐ 21st century. Climate extremes are derived for heatwaves, extreme precipitation, and flash droughts using locational‐dependent thresholds. We find that compound heatwaves and flash drought events result in the largest increases in exposure of populations, agriculture, and forest lands, under SSP5‐8.5 late‐century projections of sequential heatwaves and flash droughts. Late‐century projections of sequential heatwaves and flash droughts show hot spots of exposure increases in population exposure greater than 50 million person‐events in China, India, and Europe; increases in agriculture land exposures greater than 90 thousand km2‐events in China, South America, and Oceania; and increase in forest land exposure greater than 120 thousand km2‐events in Oceania and South America regions when compared to the historical period. The findings from this study can be potentially useful for informing global climate adaptations."

 SeS2 positive electrodes are promising components for the development of high-energy, non-aqueous lithium sulfur batteries. However, the (electro)chemical and structural evolution of this class of positive electrodes is not yet fully understood. Here, we use operando physicochemical measurements to elucidate the dissolution and deposition processes in the SeS2 positive electrodes during lithium sulfur cell charge and discharge. Our analysis of real-time imaging reveals the pivotal role of Se in the SeS2 nucleation process, while S enables selective depositions. During the initial discharge, SeS2 converts into Se and S separately, with the dissolved Se acting as nucleation sites due to their lower nucleation potential. The Se effectively catalyzes the growth of S particles, resulting in improved lithium sulfur battery performance compared to cells using positive electrodes containing only Se or S as active materials. By adjusting the Se-to-S ratio, we demonstrate that a low concentration of Se enables uniform catalytic sites, promotes the homogeneous distribution of S and favours improved lithium sulfur battery performance.

Here, the authors compare the sequence and structure of FGF14 repeat expansions in patients and controls, leading them to suggest a lower pathogenic threshold and emphasizing the importance of sequencing the full expansion for accurate interpretation. 
 Repeat expansions in FGF14 cause autosomal dominant late-onset cerebellar ataxia (SCA27B) with estimated pathogenic thresholds of 250 (incomplete penetrance) and 300 AAG repeats (full penetrance), but the sequence of pathogenic and non-pathogenic expansions remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that STRling and ExpansionHunter accurately detect FGF14 expansions from short-read genome data using outlier approaches. By combining long-range PCR and nanopore sequencing in 169 patients with cerebellar ataxia and 802 controls, we compare FGF14 expansion alleles, including interruptions and flanking regions. Uninterrupted AAG expansions are significantly enriched in patients with ataxia from a lower threshold (180–200 repeats) than previously reported based on expansion size alone. Conversely, AAGGAG hexameric expansions are equally frequent in patients and controls. Distinct 5’ flanking regions, interruptions and pre-repeat sequences correlate with repeat size. Furthermore, pure AAG (pathogenic) and AAGGAG (non-pathogenic) repeats form different secondary structures. Regardless of expansion size, SCA27B is a recognizable clinical entity characterized by frequent episodic ataxia and downbeat nystagmus, similar to the presentation observed in a family with a previously unreported nonsense variant (SCA27A). Overall, this study suggests that SCA27B is a major overlooked cause of adult-onset ataxia, accounting for 23–31% of unsolved patients. We strongly recommend re-evaluating pathogenic thresholds and integrating expansion sequencing into the molecular diagnostic process.

 Lymphocyte receptors independently evolved in both jawed and jawless vertebrates with similar adaptive immune responses. However, the diversity of functional subtypes and molecular architecture in jawless vertebrate lymphocytes, comparable to jawed species, is not well defined. Here, we profile the gills, intestines, and blood of the lamprey, Lampetra morii, with single-cell RNA sequencing, using a full-length transcriptome as a reference. Our findings reveal higher tissue-specific heterogeneity among T-like cells in contrast to B-like cells. Notably, we identify a unique T-like cell subtype expressing a homolog of the nonlymphoid hematopoietic growth factor receptor, MPL-like (MPL-L). These MPL-L+ T-like cells exhibit features distinct from T cells of jawed vertebrates, particularly in their elevated expression of hematopoietic genes. We further discovered that MPL-L+ VLRA+ T-like cells are widely present in the typhlosole, gill, liver, kidney, and skin of lamprey and they proliferate in response to both a T cell mitogen and recombinant human thrombopoietin.

 The Edelstein effect is the origin of the spin-orbit torque: a current-induced torque that is used for the electrical control of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials. This effect originates from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling, which necessitates utilizing materials with heavy elements. Here, we show that in magnetic materials with non-collinear magnetic order, the Edelstein effect and, consequently, a current-induced torque can exist even in the absence of the spin-orbit coupling. Using group symmetry analysis, model calculations, and realistic simulations on selected compounds, we identify large classes of non-collinear magnet candidates and demonstrate that the current-driven torque is of similar magnitude as the celebrated spin-orbit torque in conventional transition metal structures. We also show that this torque can exist in an insulating material, which could allow for highly efficient electrical control of magnetic order.

 The selection and combination of dose regimens for antimalarials involve complex considerations including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions.

Here, the authors show that low levels of androgens function through androgen receptor (AR) monomers to activate mTOR and promote cell proliferation, while high dose androgens induce AR dimerization to inhibit c-MYC expression and facilitate cell differentiation. 
 Most prostate cancers express the androgen receptor (AR), and tumor growth and progression are facilitated by exceptionally low levels of systemic or intratumorally produced androgens. Thus, absolute inhibition of the androgen signaling axis remains the goal of current therapeutic approaches to treat prostate cancer (PCa). Paradoxically, high dose androgens also exhibit considerable efficacy as a treatment modality in patients with late-stage metastatic PCa. Here we show that low levels of androgens, functioning through an AR monomer, facilitate a non-genomic activation of the mTOR signaling pathway to drive proliferation. Conversely, high dose androgens facilitate the formation of AR dimers/oligomers to suppress c-MYC expression, inhibit proliferation and drive a transcriptional program associated with a differentiated phenotype. These findings highlight the inherent liabilities in current approaches used to inhibit AR action in PCa and are instructive as to strategies that can be used to develop new therapeutics for this disease and other androgenopathies. The response of prostate cancer cells to androgens depends on the dose. Here, the authors show that low levels of androgens function through androgen receptor (AR) monomers to activate mTOR and promote cell proliferation, while high dose androgens induce AR dimerization to inhibit c-MYC expression and facilitate cell differentiation."

Here the authors convert cellulose to an electrolyte through molecular engineering showing good performance in solid-state Li-ion batteries. 
 As the most abundant and renewable biopolymer, cellulose has found applications in a range of fields such as healthcare, packaging, electronics and environmental remediation, contributing to the transition towards sustainability. Here we apply a green and scalable process transforming cellulose to a robust electrolyte exhibiting lithium (Li) ion conductivity of 1.09 × 10−3 S cm−1 with a transference number of 0.81 and mechanical strength of 12 MPa. Our process takes advantage of the rich hydroxyl groups in the cellulose which are replaced by phthalic anhydride through an esterification reaction to form cellulose phthalate (CP). Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the introduction of phthalate groups is essential to not only ensure effective multi-oxygen interaction with Li ions to create fast ion transportation channels, but also facilitates the intermolecular hydrogen bond responsible for the impressive mechanical properties. The CP biopolymer film is even compatible with most commercial cathode materials, and our solid-state Li/CP/LiFePO4 cells show better performance and notably good stability over 1,000 cycles than that of a baseline Li-ion cell with a flammable organic liquid electrolyte. Our study unlocks the enormous potential of cellulose utilization in batteries and opens an avenue for the development of abundant and sustainable solid-state electrolytes.

 The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 triggered a global wheat price spike and food insecurities in import-dependent countries. We combine an analysis of the global wheat supply network with an agricultural commodity price model to investigate national impaired supplies and the global annual wheat price hike, respectively, for the trade year 2022. Using a scenario analysis, we show that international cooperation manifested in the Black Sea Grain and Solidarity Lanes initiatives and the removal of export restrictions may have mitigated the 2022 price hike by 13 percentage points. In a worst case scenario – characterized by multi-breadbasket harvest failures, escalating export restrictions, and blocked Ukrainian exports – wheat price increases by 90% compared to the 2000–2020 average. Coping strategies – such as food-secure countries dispersing stocks, reducing wheat as feed, or boosting wheat production – are effective at mitigating the price spike in simplified scenarios. Our findings underscore the imperative of coordinated policy responses to avoid global food supply disruptions."

 Although internal seiches are ubiquitous in large, deep lakes, little is known about the effect of higher vertical-mode seiches on deepwater dynamics. Here, by combining entire summer season current and temperature observations and 3D numerical modeling, we demonstrate that previously undetected vertical mode-two and mode-three Poincaré waves in 309-meter deep Lake Geneva (Switzerland/France) generate bottom-boundary layer currents up to 4 cm s−1. Poincaré wave amphidromic patterns revealed three strong cells excited simultaneously. Weak hypolimnetic stratification (N2 ≈ 10−6 s−2), typical of deep lakes, significantly modified the wave structure by shifting the lower vertical node in the lake’s center from ~75-meter depth (without stratification) to ~150-meter depth (with stratification). This shift induces shear in the middle of the hypolimnion and strengthens bottom currents, with important implications for hypolimnetic mixing and sediment-water exchange. Our findings demonstrate that classical concepts based on constant temperature layers cannot correctly characterize higher vertical-mode Poincaré seiches in deep lakes.

 Precise and timely information about crop types plays a crucial role in various agriculture-related applications. However, crop type mapping methods often face significant challenges in cross-regional and cross-time scenarios with high discrepancies between temporal-spectral characteristics of crops from different regions and years. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been employed to mitigate the problem of domain shift between the source and target domains. Since these methods require source domain data during the adaptation phase, they demand significant computational resources and data storage, especially when large labeled crop mapping source datasets are available. This leads to increased energy consumption and financial costs. To address this limitation, we developed a source-free UDA method for cross-regional and cross-time crop mapping, capable of adapting the source-pretrained models to the target datasets without requiring the source datasets. The method mitigates the domain shift problem by leveraging mutual information loss. The diversity and discriminability terms in the loss function are balanced through a novel unsupervised weighting strategy based on mean confidence scores of the predicted categories. Our experiments on mapping corn, soybean, and the class Other from Landsat image time series in the U.S. demonstrated that the adapted models using different backbone networks outperformed their non-adapted counterparts. With CNN, Transformer, and LSTM backbone networks, our adaptation method increased the macro F1 scores by 12.9%, 7.1%, and 5.8% on average in cross-time tests and by 20.1%, 12.5%, and 8.8% on average in cross-regional tests, respectively. Additionally, in an experiment covering a large study area of 450 km × 300 km, the adapted model with the CNN backbone network obtained a macro F1 score of 92.6%, outperforming its non-adapted counterpart with a macro F1 score of 89.2%. Our experiments on mapping the same classes using Sentinel-2 image times series in France demonstrated the effectiveness of our method across different countries and sensors. We also tested our method in more diverse agricultural areas in Denmark and France containing six classes. The results showed that the adapted models outperformed the non-adapted models. Moreover, in within-season experiments, the adapted models performed better than the non-adapted models in the vast majority of weeks. These results and their comparison to those obtained by the other investigated UDA methods demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed method for both end-of-season and within-season crop mapping tasks. Additionally, our study showed that the method is modular and flexible in employing various backbone networks. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Sina-Mohammadi/SFUDA-CropMapping."

However, ARGs are highly diverse with respect to their resistance mechanisms, mobilities, and taxonomic hosts and therefore their behavior in WWTPs should not be expected to be universally conserved. We applied metagenomic sequencing to wastewater influent and effluent samples from 12 international WWTPs to classify the behavior of specific ARGs entering and exiting WWTPs. In total, 1079 different ARGs originating from a variety of bacteria were detected. This included ARGs that could be mapped to assembled scaffolds corresponding to nine human pathogens. While the relative abundance (per 16S rRNA gene) of ARGs decreased during treatment at 11 of the 12 WWTPs sampled and absolute abundance (per mL) decreased at all 12 WWTPs, increases in relative abundance were observed for 40% of the ARGs detected at the 12th WWTP. Also, the relative abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGE) increased during treatment, but the fraction of ARGs known to be transmissible between species decreased, thus demonstrating that increased MGE prevalence may not be generally indicative of an increase in ARGs. A distinct conserved resistome was documented in both influent and effluent across samples, suggesting that well-functioning WWTPs generally attenuate influent antibiotic resistance loads. This work helps inform strategies for wastewater surveillance of antibiotic resistance, highlighting the utility of tracking ARGs as indicators of treatment performance and relative risk reduction."

The lack of understanding regarding the mechanism behind fluoride-induced irreversible interface reconstruction hinders their practical application in large-scale energy-saving and pollution-reduction efforts. Here, we conducted multidimensional operando investigations to gain insights into the dynamic evolution across the film electrode interface with temporal and spatial resolution. Our findings reveal that electroosmosis of F– initially triggers structural collapse and subsequent reconstruction of [MnO6] units, followed by interaction with the spontaneous oxide film at the surface of lead substrate. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that F– facilitates the irreversible transformation of γ-MnO2 into more stable yet protective catalytic dual-defective α-MnO2. Additionally, lower levels of F– at the interface promote a change in microenvironmental pH within porous PbSO4, triggering the development of microporous corrosion-resistant β-PbO2 as the dominant phase. The combined effects of MnO2 and interphase evolution effectively explain the abnormally elevated oxygen evolution overpotential. Then, the proposed appropriate application scenarios based on the corrosion behavior will serve as a practical guide for the implementation of the hierarchical manganese dioxide film electrode."

The IBU@CNT-EM can generate H2O2 at a rate of 25.62 mol gCNT–1 h–1 L–1 in the permeate with a residence time of 1.81 s. We demonstrated that an interwoven, hydrophilic–hydrophobic membrane nanostructure offers an excellent air-to-water transport platform for ORR acceleration. The electron transfer number of the ORR for IBU@CNT at neutral pH was confirmed as 2.71, elucidating a near-2e selectivity to H2O2. Density functional theory (DFT) studies validated an exceptional charge distribution of the IBU@CNT for the O2 adsorption. The adsorption energies of the O2 and *OOH intermediates are proportional to the H2O2 selectivity (64.39%), higher than that of the CNT (37.81%).

After the tagging, candidates of quinones in representative aqueous environmental samples (water extractions of biochar) were identified through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis. The MS and UV spectra analysis showed rapid reactions between Cys/CCP and model quinones with β-carbon from the same benzene ring available for Michael addition.

Deletion of the 22 C-terminal amino acids of ArsI increased its demethylation activity while reducing the oxidation activity. Further deletion of 44 C-terminal residues enhanced the MAs(III) demethylation activity. ArsI has four vicinal cysteine pairs, with the first pair being necessary for MAs(III) demethylation, while at least one of the other three pairs contributes to MAs(III) oxidation. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that one of the C-terminal vicinal cysteine pairs is involved in modulating the switch between oxidase and demethylase activity.

Oxidation of certain fluorinated gases in the atmosphere is considered the primary source of TFA in the terrestrial environment, and the combined change in gas type and increased usage would therefore expectedly lead to an increased TFA burden over the last few decades. Here, we show that the concentration of TFA in 113 Danish groundwater monitoring wells is strongly correlated to the groundwater recharge year, as derived from the tritium-helium dating method. TFA was not detected in tritium-free groundwater recharged before 1960, while it was detected at low concentrations in most samples recharged between 1960 and 1980. Groundwater recharged after 1980 had at least 0.1 μg/L TFA, and the concentration increased with time. Shallow groundwater from natural “background” areas revealed some variation of TFA even with diffuse atmospheric deposition as the only source, but additional local sources must contribute TFA to some of the monitoring wells.

The downscaled simulations accurately predicted past oceanic variability at scales relevant to marine resource management, with skill typically exceeding global coarse‐resolution predictions. Over the long term, warming of the Shelf is projected to continue; however, we forecast a temporary warming pause in the next decade. This predicted pause is attributed to internal variability associated with a transient, moderate strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and a southward shift of the Gulf Stream."

However, the north‐south asymmetry of the Shabansky orbits has received relatively little attention in previous research. This study investigates this asymmetry to elucidate the recently observed phenomenon of flux separation in the pitch angle distribution during drift echo events. The asymmetry in Shabansky orbits between the northern and southern hemispheres leads to two distinct drift periods for particles with specific equatorial pitch angles, resulting in the flux separation. To quantify this phenomenon, we develop a mathematical model for the magnetic field, enabling the generation of asymmetrical Shabansky orbits. The calculated drift periods for particles with different equatorial pitch angles corresponds with the characteristics of flux separation, providing evidence to support our hypothesis that the north‐south asymmetry of Shabansky orbits is responsible for flux separation."

At present, the feedback mechanism of latent heating on the persistent eastward movement of SWVs under the influence of the orographic effect of the second‐step terrain in China remains unclear. Therefore, this study focused on clarifying the relationship between orographic effects and the mechanisms governing the persistent eastward movements of SWVs, as well as the feedback effect of latent heating on the eastward‐moving SWVs. In this study, it is revealed that discontinuous maintenance of closed vortex circulation occurs when eastward‐moving SWVs pass over the second‐step terrain region. Specifically, eastward‐moving SWVs first experience dissolution on the windward side, followed by substantial reconstruction of closed vortex circulation on the leeward side when passing over the second‐step terrain region. Moreover, the reconstruction of closed vortex circulation on the leeward side is closely associated with the feedback effect of latent heating, and the microphysical property of cold clouds identified during the vortex intensification determines the dual‐peak feature observed in the vertical constitution of the total latent heating, which is related to two major phase‐transition processes: the condensation of water vapor into liquid‐phase hydrometeors (LCP_vapor) process and the desublimation of water vapor into ice‐phase hydrometeors (LSP_vapor) process. From a potential vorticity (PV) perspective, latent heating promotes the genesis of PV anomalies, which accordingly facilitates the maintenance of a positive “vorticity tower” (i.e., total budget of vorticity) via the tilting effect and the horizontal advection effect of local vorticity. Further sensitivity experiments of latent heating indicated that latent heating associated with the LCP_vapor process fulfills a more important role in sustaining the positive “vorticity tower” than does that associated with the LSP_vapor process during the vortex intensification."

Our approach involves (a) a comprehensive characterization of multi‐hazards and their interrelationships in an urban setting, (b) collaborative development of relevant multi‐hazard scenarios with local disaster risk reduction (DRR) stakeholders, and (c) analysis of the potential for integrating these scenarios into urban DRR efforts. Using a critical review of 135 sources (academic and gray literature, databases, online, and social media), we identify 19 natural hazard types that might influence Nairobi and 23 in Istanbul. We further identified in Nairobi 88 and Istanbul 105 hazard interrelationship pairs (e.g., an earthquake triggering landslides) out of a possible 576 interrelationships. These findings are cataloged in an extensive database, which informs the creation of multi‐hazard risk scenario exemplars for each city. These exemplars are refined through stakeholder engagement, involving four workshops (47 participants) and nine semi‐structured interviews with local DRR stakeholders. Despite the identified benefits, this engagement reveals a significant gap in integrating multi‐hazards into current urban policy and practice. Governance challenges are highlighted as a key barrier, but opportunities for better integration are also identified, including evolving policies and growing awareness among urban actors. Our approach, particularly relevant in data‐scarce urban areas of low‐ and middle‐income countries, provides a framework for exploring multi‐hazard issues in various urban contexts."

 Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Risk of cardiovascular events depends on cumulative lifetime exposure to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and, independently, on the time course of exposure to LDL-C, with early exposure being associated with a higher risk1. Furthermore, LDL-C fluctuations are associated with ASCVD outcomes2-4. However, the precise mechanisms behind this increased ASCVD risk are not understood. Here, we make the unexpected observation that early intermittent feeding of mice with a high-cholesterol Western-type diet (WD) accelerates atherosclerosis compared with late continuous exposure to WD, despite similar cumulative circulating LDL-C levels. We find that early intermittent hyperlipidaemia alters the number and homeostatic phenotype of resident-like arterial macrophages. Macrophage genes with altered expression are enriched for genes linked to human ASCVD in genome-wide association studies. We show that LYVE1+ resident macrophages are atheroprotective, and identify new biological pathways, related to actin filament organisation, whose alteration accelerates atherosclerosis. Using the Young Finns Study, we show that exposure to cholesterol early in life is significantly associated with the incidence and size of carotid atherosclerotic plaques in mid-adulthood. In summary, our results identify early intermittent exposure to cholesterol as a strong determinant of accelerated atherosclerosis, highlighting the importance of optimal control of hyperlipidaemia early in life, and providing insight into the underlying biological mechanisms. This knowledge will be essential to designing effective therapeutic strategies to combat atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease."

 In naive individuals, sensory neurons directly detect and respond to allergens, leading to both the sensation of itch and the activation of local innate immune cells, which initiate the allergic immune response1,2. In the setting of chronic allergic inflammation, immune factors prime sensory neurons, causing pathologic itch3–7. Although these bidirectional neuroimmune circuits drive responses to allergens, whether immune cells regulate the set-point for neuronal activation by allergens in the naive state is unknown. Here we describe a γδ T cell–IL-3 signalling axis that controls the allergen responsiveness of cutaneous sensory neurons. We define a poorly characterized epidermal γδ T cell subset8, termed GD3 cells, that produces its hallmark cytokine IL-3 to promote allergic itch and the initiation of the allergic immune response. Mechanistically, IL-3 acts on Il3ra-expressing sensory neurons in a JAK2-dependent manner to lower their threshold for allergen activation without independently eliciting itch. This γδ T cell–IL-3 signalling axis further acts by means of STAT5 to promote neuropeptide production and the initiation of allergic immunity. These results reveal an endogenous immune rheostat that sits upstream of and governs sensory neuronal responses to allergens on first exposure. This pathway may explain individual differences in allergic susceptibility and opens new therapeutic avenues for treating allergic diseases.

 Decades of neuroimaging studies have shown modest differences in brain structure and connectivity in depression, hindering mechanistic insights or the identification of risk factors for disease onset1. Furthermore, whereas depression is episodic, few longitudinal neuroimaging studies exist, limiting understanding of mechanisms that drive mood-state transitions. The emerging field of precision functional mapping has used densely sampled longitudinal neuroimaging data to show behaviourally meaningful differences in brain network topography and connectivity between and in healthy individuals2–4, but this approach has not been applied in depression. Here, using precision functional mapping and several samples of deeply sampled individuals, we found that the frontostriatal salience network is expanded nearly twofold in the cortex of most individuals with depression. This effect was replicable in several samples and caused primarily by network border shifts, with three distinct modes of encroachment occurring in different individuals. Salience network expansion was stable over time, unaffected by mood state and detectable in children before the onset of depression later in adolescence. Longitudinal analyses of individuals scanned up to 62 times over 1.5 years identified connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that tracked fluctuations in specific symptoms and predicted future anhedonia symptoms. Together, these findings identify a trait-like brain network topology that may confer risk for depression and mood-state-dependent connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that predict the emergence and remission of depressive symptoms over time. Precision functional mapping shows that the frontostriatal salience network occupies nearly twice as much of the cortex in people with depression, and this was unaffected by mood changes and detected in children before onset of symptoms."

 Negotiations for a global treaty on plastic pollution1 will shape future policies on plastics production, use and waste management. Its parties will benefit from a high-resolution baseline of waste flows and plastic emission sources to enable identification of pollution hotspots and their causes2. Nationally aggregated waste management data can be distributed to smaller scales to identify generalized points of plastic accumulation and source phenomena3–11. However, it is challenging to use this type of spatial allocation to assess the conditions under which emissions take place12,13. Here we develop a global macroplastic pollution emissions inventory by combining conceptual modelling of emission mechanisms with measurable activity data. We define emissions as materials that have moved from the managed or mismanaged system (controlled or contained state) to the unmanaged system (uncontrolled or uncontained state—the environment). Using machine learning and probabilistic material flow analysis, we identify emission hotspots across 50,702 municipalities worldwide from five land-based plastic waste emission sources. We estimate global plastic waste emissions at 52.1 [48.3–56.3] million metric tonnes (Mt) per year, with approximately 57% wt. and 43% wt. open burned and unburned debris, respectively. Littering is the largest emission source in the Global North, whereas uncollected waste is the dominant emissions source across the Global South. We suggest that our findings can help inform treaty negotiations and develop national and sub-national waste management action plans and source inventories.

 Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) are historical intervals of global-scale ocean deoxygenation associated with hyperthermal climate states and biological crises1,2. Massive volcanic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions frequently associated with these events are thought to be a common driver of ocean deoxygenation through several climate-warming-related mechanisms1,3,4. The Early Cretaceous OAE1a is one of the most intense ocean deoxygenation events, persisting for more than 1 Myr (refs. 5,6). However, existing records of marine chemistry and climate across OAE1a are insufficient to fully resolve the timing and dynamics of the underlying processes, thus obscuring cause-and-effect relationships between climate forcing and ocean oxygenation states. Here we show that rapid ocean deoxygenation during OAE1a is linked to volcanic CO2 emissions and the crossing of an associated climate threshold, after which the sluggish pace of the silicate-weathering feedback and climate recovery delayed reoxygenation for >1 Myr. At the end of OAE1a, recrossing this threshold allowed for ocean reoxygenation. Following OAE1a, however, the Earth system remained sufficiently warm such that orbitally forced climate dynamics led to continued cyclic ocean deoxygenation on approximately 100-kyr timescales for another 1 Myr. Our results thus imply a tight coupling between volcanism, weathering and ocean oxygen content that is characterized by a climate threshold. Rapid ocean deoxygenation during the Early Cretaceous OAE1a is shown to provide evidence for a strong link between volcanic CO2 emissions, weathering and ocean oxygen content that is characterized by a climate threshold."

 The adoption of agriculture triggered a rapid shift towards starch-rich diets in human populations1. Amylase genes facilitate starch digestion, and increased amylase copy number has been observed in some modern human populations with high-starch intake2, although evidence of recent selection is lacking3,4. Here, using 94 long-read haplotype-resolved assemblies and short-read data from approximately 5,600 contemporary and ancient humans, we resolve the diversity and evolutionary history of structural variation at the amylase locus. We find that amylase genes have higher copy numbers in agricultural populations than in fishing, hunting and pastoral populations. We identify 28 distinct amylase structural architectures and demonstrate that nearly identical structures have arisen recurrently on different haplotype backgrounds throughout recent human history. AMY1 and AMY2A genes each underwent multiple duplication/deletion events with mutation rates up to more than 10,000-fold the single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation rate, whereas AMY2B gene duplications share a single origin. Using a pangenome-based approach, we infer structural haplotypes across thousands of humans identifying extensively duplicated haplotypes at higher frequency in modern agricultural populations. Leveraging 533 ancient human genomes, we find that duplication-containing haplotypes (with more gene copies than the ancestral haplotype) have rapidly increased in frequency over the past 12,000 years in West Eurasians, suggestive of positive selection. Together, our study highlights the potential effects of the agricultural revolution on human genomes and the importance of structural variation in human adaptation.

 CDK1 has been known to be the sole cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) partner of cyclin B1 to drive mitotic progression1. Here we demonstrate that CDK5 is active during mitosis and is necessary for maintaining mitotic fidelity. CDK5 is an atypical CDK owing to its high expression in post-mitotic neurons and activation by non-cyclin proteins p35 and p392. Here, using independent chemical genetic approaches, we specifically abrogated CDK5 activity during mitosis, and observed mitotic defects, nuclear atypia and substantial alterations in the mitotic phosphoproteome. Notably, cyclin B1 is a mitotic co-factor of CDK5. Computational modelling, comparison with experimentally derived structures of CDK–cyclin complexes and validation with mutational analysis indicate that CDK5–cyclin B1 can form a functional complex. Disruption of the CDK5–cyclin B1 complex phenocopies CDK5 abrogation in mitosis.

 Infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions present differently in males and females. SARS-CoV-2 infection in naive males is associated with increased risk of death, whereas females are at increased risk of long COVID1, similar to observations in other infections2. Females respond more strongly to vaccines, and adverse reactions are more frequent3, like most autoimmune diseases4. Immunological sex differences stem from genetic, hormonal and behavioural factors5 but their relative importance is only partially understood6–8. In individuals assigned female sex at birth and undergoing gender-affirming testosterone therapy (trans men), hormone concentrations change markedly but the immunological consequences are poorly understood. Here we performed longitudinal systems-level analyses in 23 trans men and found that testosterone modulates a cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumour necrosis factor. This is mediated by functional attenuation of type-I interferon responses in both plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes. Conversely, testosterone potentiates monocyte responses leading to increased tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-15 production and downstream activation of nuclear factor kappa B-regulated genes and potentiation of interferon-γ responses, primarily in natural killer cells. These findings in trans men are corroborated by sex-divergent responses in public datasets and illustrate the dynamic regulation of human immunity by sex hormones, with implications for the health of individuals undergoing hormone therapy and our understanding of sex-divergent immune responses in cisgender individuals.

Meeske,Diverse viral cas genes antagonize CRISPR immunity,"We demonstrate that phages have co-opted cas genes from CRISPR defence systems, which subsequently evolved anti-defence functions. 
 Prokaryotic CRISPR–Cas immunity is subverted by anti-CRISPRs (Acrs), which inhibit Cas protein activities when expressed during the phage lytic cycle or from resident prophages or plasmids1. Acrs often bind to specific cognate Cas proteins, and hence inhibition is typically limited to a single CRISPR–Cas subtype2. Furthermore, although acr genes are frequently organized together in phage-associated gene clusters3, how such inhibitors initially evolve has remained unclear. Here we investigated the Acr content and inhibition specificity of diverse Listeria isolates, which naturally harbour four CRISPR–Cas systems (types I-B, II-A, II-C and VI-A). We observed widespread antagonism of CRISPR, which we traced to 11 previously unknown and 4 known acr gene families encoded by endogenous mobile elements. Among these were two Acrs that possess sequence homology to type I-B Cas proteins, one of which assembles into a defective interference complex. Surprisingly, an additional type I-B Cas homologue did not affect type I immunity, but instead inhibited the RNA-targeting type VI CRISPR system by means of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) degradation. By probing viral sequence databases, we detected abundant orphan cas genes located within putative anti-defence gene clusters. Among them, we verified the activity of a particularly broad-spectrum cas3 homologue that inhibits type I-B, II-A and VI-A CRISPR immunity. Our observations provide direct evidence of Acr evolution by cas gene co-option, and new genes with potential for broad-spectrum control of genome editing technologies. We demonstrate that phages have co-opted cas genes from CRISPR defence systems, which subsequently evolved anti-defence functions."

Back,Signatures of magnetism control by flow of angular momentum,"Signatures of magnetism control by the flow of angular momentum are observed in Pt/Al/Fe/GaAs(001) multilayers by the application of an in-plane charge current in Pt. 
 Exploring new strategies to manipulate the order parameter of magnetic materials by electrical means is of great importance not only for advancing our understanding of fundamental magnetism but also for unlocking potential applications. A well-established concept uses gate voltages to control magnetic properties by modulating the carrier population in a capacitor structure1–5. Here we show that, in Pt/Al/Fe/GaAs(001) multilayers, the application of an in-plane charge current in Pt leads to a shift in the ferromagnetic resonance field depending on the microwave frequency when the Fe film is sufficiently thin. The experimental observation is interpreted as a current-induced modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ΔHA of Fe. We show that (1) ΔHA decreases with increasing Fe film thickness and is connected to the damping-like torque; and (2) ΔHA depends not only on the polarity of charge current but also on the magnetization direction, that is, ΔHA has an opposite sign when the magnetization direction is reversed. The symmetry of the modification is consistent with a current-induced spin6–8 and/or orbit9–13 accumulation, which, respectively, act on the spin and/or orbit component of the magnetization. In this study, as Pt is regarded as a typical spin current source6,14, the spin current can play a dominant part. The control of magnetism by a spin current results from the modified exchange splitting of the majority and minority spin bands, providing functionality that was previously unknown and could be useful in advanced spintronic devices.

 Optical atomic clocks1,2 use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low-energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have, therefore, been proposed for construction of a nuclear clock3,4. However, quantum-state-resolved spectroscopy of the 229mTh isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow 229Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF2 host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA 87Sr clock2 and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its seventh harmonic in the VUV range by using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the 229Th nuclear clock transition and the 87Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clocks and demonstrate the first comparison, to our knowledge, of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong-field physics, nuclear physics and fundamental physics.

 The canonical theory for planet formation in circumstellar disks proposes that planets are grown from initially much smaller seeds1–5. The long-considered alternative theory proposes that giant protoplanets can be formed directly from collapsing fragments of vast spiral arms6–11 induced by gravitational instability12–14—if the disk is gravitationally unstable. For this to be possible, the disk must be massive compared with the central star: a disk-to-star mass ratio of 1:10 is widely held as the rough threshold for triggering gravitational instability, inciting substantial non-Keplerian dynamics and generating prominent spiral arms15–18. Although estimating disk masses has historically been challenging19–21, the motion of the gas can reveal the presence of gravitational instability through its effect on the disk-velocity structure22–24. Here we present kinematic evidence of gravitational instability in the disk around AB Aurigae, using deep observations of 13CO and C18O line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The observed kinematic signals strongly resemble predictions from simulations and analytic modelling. From quantitative comparisons, we infer a disk mass of up to a third of the stellar mass enclosed within 1″ to 5″ on the sky.

 The long-term physiological consequences of respiratory viral infections, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic—termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)—are rapidly evolving into a major public health concern1–3. While the cellular and molecular aetiologies of these sequelae are poorly defined, increasing evidence implicates abnormal immune responses3–6 and/or impaired organ recovery7–9 after infection. However, the precise mechanisms that link these processes in the context of PASC remain unclear. Here, with insights from three cohorts of patients with respiratory PASC, we established a mouse model of post-viral lung disease and identified an aberrant immune–epithelial progenitor niche unique to fibroproliferation in respiratory PASC. Using spatial transcriptomics and imaging, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8+ T cell–macrophage interactions in impairing alveolar regeneration and driving fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Specifically, IFNγ and TNF derived from CD8+ T cells stimulated local macrophages to chronically release IL-1β, resulting in the long-term maintenance of dysplastic epithelial progenitors and lung fibrosis. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFNγ + TNF or IL-1β markedly improved alveolar regeneration and pulmonary function. In contrast to other approaches, which require early intervention10, we highlight therapeutic strategies to rescue fibrotic disease after the resolution of acute disease, addressing a current unmet need in the clinical management of PASC and post-viral disease.

 Futuristic technologies such as morphing aircrafts and super-strong artificial muscles depend on metal alloys being as strong as ultrahigh-strength steel yet as flexible as a polymer1–3. However, achieving such ‘strong yet flexible’ alloys has proven challenging4–9 because of the inevitable trade-off between strength and flexibility5,8,10. Here we report a Ti–50.8 at.% Ni strain glass alloy showing a combination of ultrahigh yield strength of σy ≈ 1.8 GPa and polymer-like ultralow elastic modulus of E ≈ 10.5 GPa, together with super-large rubber-like elastic strain of approximately 8%. As a result, it possesses a high flexibility figure of merit of σy/E ≈ 0.17 compared with existing structural materials. In addition, it can maintain such properties over a wide temperature range of −80 °C to +80 °C and demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance at high strain. The alloy was fabricated by a simple three-step thermomechanical treatment that is scalable to industrial lines, which leads not only to ultrahigh strength because of deformation strengthening, but also to ultralow modulus by the formation of a unique ‘dual-seed strain glass’ microstructure, composed of a strain glass matrix embedded with a small number of aligned R and B19′ martensite ‘seeds’. In situ X-ray diffractometry shows that the polymer-like deformation behaviour of the alloy originates from a nucleation-free reversible transition between strain glass and R and B19′ martensite during loading and unloading. This exotic alloy with the potential for mass producibility may open a new horizon for many futuristic technologies, such as morphing aerospace vehicles, superman-type artificial muscles and artificial organs.

 Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the mammalian brain and provide structural and metabolic support to neurons, regulate synapses and become reactive after injury and disease. However, a small subset of astrocytes settles in specialized areas of the adult brain where these astrocytes instead actively generate differentiated neuronal and glial progeny and are therefore referred to as neural stem cells1–3. Common parenchymal astrocytes and quiescent neural stem cells share similar transcriptomes despite their very distinct functions4–6. Thus, how stem cell activity is molecularly encoded remains unknown. Here we examine the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and methylome of neural stem cells and their progeny, and of astrocytes from the striatum and cortex in the healthy and ischaemic adult mouse brain. We identify distinct methylation profiles associated with either astrocyte or stem cell function. Stem cell function is mediated by methylation of astrocyte genes and demethylation of stem cell genes that are expressed later. Ischaemic injury to the brain induces gain of stemness in striatal astrocytes7. We show that this response involves reprogramming the astrocyte methylome to a stem cell methylome and is absent if the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3A is missing. Overall, we unveil DNA methylation as a promising target for regenerative medicine. Single-cell analysis of the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and methylome of adult neural stem cells and astrocytes demonstrates that stemness is driven by methylation profiles distinct from those of astrocytes."

 Systemic immune responses caused by chronic hypercholesterolaemia contribute to atherosclerosis initiation, progression and complications1. However, individuals often change their dietary habits over time2, and the effects of an alternating high-fat diet (HFD) on atherosclerosis remain unclear. Here, to address this relevant issue, we developed a protocol using atherosclerosis-prone mice to compare an alternating versus continuous HFD while maintaining similar overall exposure periods. We found that an alternating HFD accelerated atherosclerosis in Ldlr−/− and Apoe−/− mice compared with a continuous HFD. This pro-atherogenic effect of the alternating HFD was also observed in Apoe−/−Rag2−/− mice lacking T, B and natural killer T cells, ruling out the role of the adaptive immune system in the observed phenotype. Discontinuing the HFD in the alternating HFD group downregulated RUNX13, promoting inflammatory signalling in bone marrow myeloid progenitors. After re-exposure to an HFD, these cells produced IL-1β, leading to emergency myelopoiesis and increased neutrophil levels in blood. Neutrophils infiltrated plaques and released neutrophil extracellular traps, exacerbating atherosclerosis. Specific depletion of neutrophils or inhibition of IL-1β pathways abolished emergency myelopoiesis and reversed the pro-atherogenic effects of the alternating HFD. This study highlights the role of IL-1β-dependent neutrophil progenitor reprogramming in accelerated atherosclerosis induced by alternating HFD.

 Oncogenic mutations are abundant in the tissues of healthy individuals, but rarely form tumours1–3. Yet, the underlying protection mechanisms are largely unknown. To resolve these mechanisms in mouse mammary tissue, we use lineage tracing to map the fate of wild-type and Brca1−/−;Trp53−/− cells, and find that both follow a similar pattern of loss and spread within ducts. Clonal analysis reveals that ducts consist of small repetitive units of self-renewing cells that give rise to short-lived descendants. This offers a first layer of protection as any descendants, including oncogenic mutant cells, are constantly lost, thereby limiting the spread of mutations to a single stem cell-descendant unit. Local tissue remodelling during consecutive oestrous cycles leads to the cooperative and stochastic loss and replacement of self-renewing cells. This process provides a second layer of protection, leading to the elimination of most mutant clones while enabling the minority that by chance survive to expand beyond the stem cell-descendant unit. This leads to fields of mutant cells spanning large parts of the epithelial network, predisposing it for transformation. Eventually, clone expansion becomes restrained by the geometry of the ducts, providing a third layer of protection. Together, these mechanisms act to eliminate most cells that acquire somatic mutations at the expense of driving the accelerated expansion of a minority of cells, which can colonize large areas, leading to field cancerization. The authors use lineage tracing to map the fate of wild-type and Brca1−/−;Trp53−/− cells in the adult mouse mammary gland, identifying three layers of protection that limit the spread of mutant cells at the expense of allowing a minority of mutant cells to expand, which leads to field cancerization."

 Fifty-eight million individuals worldwide are affected by chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a primary driver of liver cancer for which no vaccine is available1. The HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2 form a heterodimer (E1/E2), which is the target for neutralizing antibodies2.

 Histopathology image evaluation is indispensable for cancer diagnoses and subtype classification. Standard artificial intelligence methods for histopathology image analyses have focused on optimizing specialized models for each diagnostic task1,2. Although such methods have achieved some success, they often have limited generalizability to images generated by different digitization protocols or samples collected from different populations3. Here, to address this challenge, we devised the Clinical Histopathology Imaging Evaluation Foundation (CHIEF) model, a general-purpose weakly supervised machine learning framework to extract pathology imaging features for systematic cancer evaluation. CHIEF leverages two complementary pretraining methods to extract diverse pathology representations: unsupervised pretraining for tile-level feature identification and weakly supervised pretraining for whole-slide pattern recognition. We developed CHIEF using 60,530 whole-slide images spanning 19 anatomical sites. Through pretraining on 44 terabytes of high-resolution pathology imaging datasets, CHIEF extracted microscopic representations useful for cancer cell detection, tumour origin identification, molecular profile characterization and prognostic prediction. We successfully validated CHIEF using 19,491 whole-slide images from 32 independent slide sets collected from 24 hospitals and cohorts internationally. Overall, CHIEF outperformed the state-of-the-art deep learning methods by up to 36.1%, showing its ability to address domain shifts observed in samples from diverse populations and processed by different slide preparation methods.

We characterized 125 virus species, including 36 that were novel and 39 at potentially high risk of cross-species transmission, including zoonotic spillover. Notably, we identified seven species of coronaviruses, expanding their known host range, and documented the cross-species transmission of a novel canine respiratory coronavirus to raccoon dogs and of bat HKU5-like coronaviruses to mink, present at a high abundance in lung tissues.

 Viral glycoproteins drive membrane fusion in enveloped viruses and determine host range, tissue tropism and pathogenesis1. Despite their importance, there is a fragmentary understanding of glycoproteins within the Flaviviridae2, a large virus family that include pathogens such as hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses, and numerous other human, animal and emergent viruses. For many flaviviruses the glycoproteins have not yet been identified, for others, such as the hepaciviruses, the molecular mechanisms of membrane fusion remain uncharacterized3. Here we combine phylogenetic analyses with protein structure prediction to survey glycoproteins across the entire Flaviviridae. We find class II fusion systems, homologous to the Orthoflavivirus E glycoprotein in most species, including highly divergent jingmenviruses and large genome flaviviruses. However, the E1E2 glycoproteins of the hepaciviruses, pegiviruses and pestiviruses are structurally distinct, may represent a novel class of fusion mechanism, and are strictly associated with infection of vertebrate hosts. By mapping glycoprotein distribution onto the underlying phylogeny, we reveal a complex evolutionary history marked by the capture of bacterial genes and potentially inter-genus recombination. These insights, made possible through protein structure prediction, refine our understanding of viral fusion mechanisms and reveal the events that have shaped the diverse virology and ecology of the Flaviviridae. Combined phylogenetic analyses and glycoprotein structure prediction across the Flaviviridae reveals divergent membrane fusion systems and provides insights into the complex evolutionary history within this family of viruses."

 Our genomes influence nearly every aspect of human biology—from molecular and cellular functions to phenotypes in health and disease. Studying the differences in DNA sequence between individuals (genomic variation) could reveal previously unknown mechanisms of human biology, uncover the basis of genetic predispositions to diseases, and guide the development of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents. Yet, understanding how genomic variation alters genome function to influence phenotype has proved challenging. To unlock these insights, we need a systematic and comprehensive catalogue of genome function and the molecular and cellular effects of genomic variants. Towards this goal, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium will combine approaches in single-cell mapping, genomic perturbations and predictive modelling to investigate the relationships among genomic variation, genome function and phenotypes. IGVF will create maps across hundreds of cell types and states describing how coding variants alter protein activity, how noncoding variants change the regulation of gene expression, and how such effects connect through gene-regulatory and protein-interaction networks. These experimental data, computational predictions and accompanying standards and pipelines will be integrated into an open resource that will catalyse community efforts to explore how our genomes influence biology and disease across populations.

 Traumatic injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) afflict millions of individuals worldwide1, yet an effective treatment remains elusive. Following such injuries, the site is populated by a multitude of peripheral immune cells, including T cells, but a comprehensive understanding of the roles and antigen specificity of these endogenous T cells at the injury site has been lacking. This gap has impeded the development of immune-mediated cellular therapies for CNS injuries. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrated the clonal expansion of mouse and human spinal cord injury-associated T cells and identified that CD4+ T cell clones in mice exhibit antigen specificity towards self-peptides of myelin and neuronal proteins. Leveraging mRNA-based T cell receptor (TCR) reconstitution, a strategy aimed to minimize potential adverse effects from prolonged activation of self-reactive T cells, we generated engineered transiently autoimmune T cells. These cells demonstrated notable neuroprotective efficacy in CNS injury models, in part by modulating myeloid cells via IFNγ. Our findings elucidate mechanistic insight underlying the neuroprotective function of injury-responsive T cells and pave the way for the future development of T cell therapies for CNS injuries. This study presents a new T cell therapy targeting spinal cord injury, providing a potential new approach for injured CNS."

 Myocarditis is the most salient serious adverse event following messenger RNA-based Covid-19 vaccines. The highest risk is observed after the second dose compared to the first, whereas the level of risk associated with more distant booster doses seems to lie in between.

 Beige fat activation involves a fuel switch to fatty acid oxidation following chronic cold adaptation. Mitochondrial acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1) localizes in the mitochondria and plays a key role in fatty acid oxidation; however, the regulatory mechanism of the subcellular localization remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an endosomal trafficking component sortilin (encoded by Sort1) in adipose tissues that shows dynamic expression during beige fat activation and facilitates the translocation of ACSL1 from the mitochondria to the endolysosomal pathway for degradation. Depletion of sortilin in adipocytes results in an increase of mitochondrial ACSL1 and the activation of AMPK/PGC1α signaling, thereby activating beige fat and preventing high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Collectively, our findings indicate that sortilin controls adipose tissue fatty acid oxidation by substrate fuel selection during beige fat activation and provides a potential targeted approach for the treatment of metabolic diseases.

Here, Makar et al. show that RNAseK is involved in a lysosomal hydrolase delivery pathway that contributes to autophagosomal membrane degradation. 
 Autophagy is a finely orchestrated process required for the lysosomal degradation of cytosolic components. The final degradation step is essential for clearing autophagic cargo and recycling macromolecules. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based screen, we identify RNAseK, a highly conserved transmembrane protein, as a regulator of autophagosome degradation. Analyses of RNAseK knockout cells reveal that, while autophagosome maturation is intact, cargo degradation is severely disrupted. Importantly, lysosomal protease activity and acidification remain intact in the absence of RNAseK suggesting a specificity to autolysosome degradation. Analyses of lysosome fractions show reduced levels of a subset of hydrolases in the absence of RNAseK. Of these, the knockdown of PLD3 leads to a defect in autophagosome clearance. Furthermore, the lysosomal fraction of RNAseK-depleted cells exhibits an accumulation of the ESCRT-III complex component, VPS4a, which is required for the lysosomal targeting of PLD3. Altogether, here we identify a lysosomal hydrolase delivery pathway required for efficient autolysosome degradation. The degradation of inner autophagosomal membranes remains poorly understood.

 Optical wireless communication (OWC) stands out as one of the most promising technologies in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. The establishment of high-quality optical links between transmitters and receivers plays a crucial role in OWC performances. Here, by a compact beam splitter composed of a metasurface and a fiber array, we proposed a wide-angle (~120°) OWC optical link scheme that can parallelly support up to 144 communication users. Utilizing high-speed optical module sources and wavelength division multiplexing technique, we demonstrated each user can achieve a communication speed of 200 Gbps which enables the entire system to support ultra-high communication capacity exceeding 28 Tbps. Furthermore, utilizing the metasurface polarization multiplexing, we implemented a full range wide-angle OWC without blind area nor crosstalk among users.

 Capturing extreme surface velocities with  >50 km/s dynamic range, which arise in shock physics such as inertial confinement fusion (ICF), is beyond the reach of conventional photon Doppler velocimetry (PDV) systems due to the need for extremely large electrical bandwidth under such conditions. The recent ignition in ICF calls for new velocimetry that can measure velocities exceeding 100 km/s. Time lens PDV (TL-PDV) is a solution where the high frequency beat signal from a conventional PDV system is periodically temporally magnified in the optical domain using a time lens. Here we experimentally demonstrate TL-PDV for the first time, validate the performance over a 74 km/s velocity range with high accuracy using a temporal magnification factor of 7.6, and verify excellent agreement with conventional PDV for laser driven micro-flyer experiments. TL-PDV currently provides the largest velocity dynamic range among PDV systems and is scalable to even higher velocities, which makes it an ideal candidate for material characterization under the most extreme conditions such as optimizing fuel efficiency in ICF experiments.

 Climate change is projected to have substantial economic, social, and environmental impacts worldwide. Currently, the leading solutions for hydrogen storage are in salt caverns, and depleted natural gas reservoirs. However, the required geological formations are limited to certain regions. To increase alternatives for hydrogen storage, this paper proposes storing hydrogen in pipes filled with gravel in lakes, hydropower, and pumped hydro storage reservoirs. Hydrogen is insoluble in water, non-toxic, and does not threaten aquatic life. Results show the levelized cost of hydrogen storage to be 0.17 USD kg−1 at 200 m depth, which is competitive with other large scale hydrogen storage options. Storing hydrogen in lakes, hydropower, and pumped hydro storage reservoirs increases the alternatives for storing hydrogen and might support the development of a hydrogen economy in the future.

Here the authors investigate exploration behaviour across different domains and whether tendency to explore is stable over time. 
 Given the ubiquity of exploration in everyday life, researchers from many disciplines have developed methods to measure exploratory behaviour. There are therefore many ways to quantify and measure exploration. However, it remains unclear whether the different measures (i) have convergent validity relative to one another, (ii) capture a domain general tendency, and (iii) capture a tendency that is stable across time. In a sample of 678 participants, we found very little evidence of convergent validity for the behavioural measures (Hypothesis 1); most of the behavioural measures lacked sufficient convergent validity with one another or with the self-reports. In psychometric modelling analyses, we could not identify a good fitting model with an assumed general tendency to explore (Hypothesis 2); the best fitting model suggested that the different behavioural measures capture behaviours that are specific to the tasks. In a subsample of 254 participants who completed the study a second time, we found that the measures had stability across an 1 month timespan (Hypothesis 3). Therefore, although there were stable individual differences in how people approached each task across time, there was no generalizability across tasks, and drawing broad conclusions about exploratory behaviour from studies using these tasks may be problematic.

 Reducing fisheries bycatches of vulnerable species is critical to marine biodiversity conservation and sustainable fisheries development. Although various preventive technical measures have been implemented, their overall effects are poorly understood. Here, we used a meta-analysis approach to quantify the effects of 42 technical measures on the target catch and the bycatch of seabirds, elasmobranchs, marine mammals and sea turtles. We showed that these measures generally reduced the bycatch while having no statistically significant effect on the target catch. Sensory-based measures generally outperformed physical-based ones in reducing the bycatch. Mitigation measures that worked well for several fishing gears or taxa, although useful, were very rare. Most of the adoptions by regional fisheries management organizations (59%) were supported by our findings, although many others are yet to be robustly evaluated. Our study encourages the innovation and adoption of technical measures and provides crucial insights for policy-making and further research in sustainable bycatch management.

This study evaluates this system in double-cropped maize ethanol production in Brazil. 
 Sustainable energy and food production can include double-cropping where two crops are produced sequentially on land required for one crop to maximize resource use. In Brazil, this system involves maize being planted as a second crop following soybean to generate ethanol, thus allowing for combined food–energy production. However, the impacts of such production systems on several sustainable development goals (SDG) and associated indirect land-use changes have not yet fully been explored. We evaluate the fast-expanding food–energy system of double-cropped maize ethanol in the Central-West region of Brazil with respect to SDG impacts, combining life-cycle environmental and computable general equilibrium socio-economic models. We find that this system provides renewable and affordable energy (5 billion litres of ethanol, 600 MWh of electrical power) and feed (4 million tons of distillers dried grains), reduces greenhouse gas emissions (9.3 million to 13.2 million tCO2e), saves land (160,000 ha), boosts regional income and consumption, improves food security and benefits ecosystems and human health. Underlying drivers associated with this were the integration of feedstock supply into existing practices and the use of eucalyptus chips to provide process energy. The sustainability of this production system is improved further by carbon capture and storage. Combined food–energy production systems can help improve resource-use efficiency, but the extent to which such systems contribute to sustainable development has not yet been fully explored.

 Many fruits and nuts crops in California require sufficient winter chill to break dormancy, and insufficient chill can harm fruit quantity and quality. Early information on winter chill forecast can help growers prepare for a low chill year. Here we evaluate use of dynamic climate models for chill accumulation forecast in California. Using temperature forecasts from seasonal prediction systems, we found that the multimodel forecasts can predict chill. This is evident from the anomaly correlation coefficients exceeding 0.5 between the model-predicted and reference chill values for most California regions. The forecasts correctly identified chill categories in over 50% instances in more than 40% of the Central Valley and southern parts of California. The forecasts also demonstrated skill in capturing the interannual variability of chill, especially during years with substantial decrease in chill. Additionally, the seasonal forecast can provide potentially useful crop specific chill sufficiency prediction. However, forecasts beyond a one-month lead time showed reduced forecast skills.

However, the greening sustainability remains uncertain due to challenges from carbonate geological constraints and oversights in recognizing synergies within social-ecological systems. Here, the sustainability and drivers of tree cover restoration were quantitatively investigated in South China Karst. The area with tree cover increasing was 652,457 km2, about 33.67% of the study area. There were differences in ecological elements between karst and non-karst areas, and rural population decrease in undeveloped areas could greatly promote tree cover restoration.

 Global prevalence of microplastics underscores the urgent need to investigate the ecology and biogeochemistry of the plastisphere. However, plastisphere mycobiome, particularly in terrestrial environments, remains largely unexplored. We conducted a comparative analysis of soil and plastisphere fungal communities using 125 experimental microcosms. Our results revealed distinct taxonomic structures between these two environments, with the genera Penicillium and pathogenic Alternaria being specifically enriched in the plastisphere. In comparison with soil communities, plastisphere communities exhibited weaker associations with environmental variables. Stochastic processes were found to be primary drivers of plastisphere fungal community assembly. Limited dispersal of fungal communities on soil microplastics was obtained, suggesting potential implications for taxa isolation or even diversity loss. The expanding plastisphere would pose critical planetary ecology challenges.

 Forest canopy height (FCH) is crucial for monitoring forest structure and aboveground biomass. Light detecting and ranging (LiDAR), as a promising remote sensing technology, provides various forms of data for measuring and mapping FCH. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) could accurately measure FCH at the plot-level. Spaceborne lidar system (SLS) allows for global sampling of FCH at the footprint-level. However, ALS data has limited spatial coverage, while SLS data has relatively lower estimation accuracy. To this end, we proposed a two-step FCH mapping framework by combining ALS, SLS and auxiliary data. Firstly, using the ALS-derived FCH as reference, the SLS-derived relative height metrics were calibrated at the footprint-level using a regression method. Secondly, to further address the spatial discontinuities in SLS-derived FCH maps, a site-level FCH model was built using a weighted ensemble multi-machine learning model incorporating spatial effects (WEML_SE). The calibrated footprint-level calibration FCH model was used as a reference, and multiple remote sensing data metrics were selected and subjected to important variable selection. Specifically, a spatial adjacency matrix was established based on the spatial locations of SLS footprints, and spatial feature vectors were extracted. The result indicated that the correlation coefficient between the SLS-derived FCH and the ALS-derived FCH (r = 0.39–0.73, MRE=10.6–25.9 %, and RMSE=2.58–9.37 m) improved at footprint-level (r = 0.71–0.84, MRE=7.7–18.7 %, RMSE=1.96–7.68 m). Moreover, the WEML_SE exhibited better performance (r = 0.59–0.75, MRE=8.8–14.8 %, RMSE=2.12–5.4 m) compared to the model without incorporating spatial effects (r = 0.45–0.71, MRE=9.4–15.8 %, RMSE=2.28–5.89 m). This study emphasizes the advantages of integrating spaceborne and airborne LiDAR data to construct footprint-level estimation of FCH.

 Reconstructing semantic indoor scenes is a challenging task in augmented and virtual reality. The quality of scene reconstruction is limited by the complexity and occlusion of indoor scenes. This is due to the difficulty in estimating the spatial structure of the scene and insufficient learning for object location inference. To address these challenges, we have developed PesRec, an end-to-end multi-task scene reconstruction network for parameterizing indoor semantic information. PesRec incorporates a newly designed spatial layout estimator and a 3D object detector to effectively learn scene parameter features from RGB images. We modify an object mesh generator to enhance the robustness of reconstructing indoor occluded objects through point cloud optimization in PesRec. Using the analyzed scene parameters and spatial structure, the proposed PesRec reconstructs an indoor scene by placing object meshes scaled to 3D detection boxes in an estimated layout cuboid. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that PesRec performs exceptionally well for object reconstruction with an average chamfer distance of 5.24 × 10-3 on the Pix3D dataset including 53.61 % mAP for 3D object detection and 79.7 % 3D IoU for the estimation of layout on the commonly-used SUN RGB-D datasets.

 The hierarchical structure of geographic or urban space can be well-characterized by the concept of living structure, a term coined by Christopher Alexander. All spaces, regardless of their size, possess certain degrees of livingness that can be mathematically quantified. While previous studies have successfully quantified the livingness of small spaces such as images or artworks, the livingness of geographic space has not yet been characterized in a recursive manner. Zipf’s law has been observed in urban systems and intra-urban structures. However, whether Zipf’s law is applicable to the hierarchical substructures of geographic space has rarely been investigated. In this study, we recursively extract the substructures of geographic space using global nighttime light imagery. We quantify the livingness of global cities considering the number of substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). We further investigate the scaling properties of the extracted substructures across scales and the relationships between livingness and population for global cities. The results demonstrate that all substructures of global cities form a living structure that conforms to Zipf’s law. The degree of livingness better captures population distribution than nighttime light intensity values for the global cities. This study contributes in three aspects: First, it considers global cities as a whole to quantify spatial livingness. Second, it applies the concept of livingness to cities to better capture the spatial structure of the population using nighttime light data. Third, it introduces a novel method to recursively extract substructures from nighttime images, offering a valuable tool to investigate urban structures across multiple spatial scales."

 Burned forests were detected using remote sensing techniques. Yet, identifying long-term burned forests in the mountains, especially at a large spatial extent, remains a great challenge due to a lack of long-term high-resolution remote sensing data or the unsatisfactory performance of the moderate-resolution remotely sensed data in complex mountain landscapes. Efficient, robust, and cost-effective methods are urgently called for. In this study, we developed a novel method combining remote sensing and ecological mechanisms (short for RSEM-M) with a paired-pixel approach to identify the long-term burned forests in Southwest China, where the terrain is rugged. In mapping burned forests in 2010, the overall accuracy, producer accuracy, user accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and field validation accuracy were 92.27 %, 95.86 %, 88.36 %, 0.85, and 81.16 %, respectively. Compared to the standard procedure and FireCCI51 and MCD64A1 fire products, the RSEM-M shows higher accuracy and consistency in identifying burned forests of different sizes, with fewer invalid pixels, better spatial continuity, and more accurate boundary delineation. Then, using the RSEM-M, we mapped burned forests in Southwest China from 2002 to 2017. The cumulative areas were 37.69 × 104 ha.

The interactions between human ODA16 homolog HsDAW1 and ARL GTPases are conserved, and these interactions are altered in HsDAW1 disease variants. These findings revealed a conserved function of ARL GTPases in IFT transport of motile ciliary components, and a mechanism of cargo unloading from the IFT."

Using a massive new dataset of 66,000 interviews (cross-sectional and panel), we find that animosities are durable and consistent over the course of the 2022 US election. Individuals with more exposure to the campaign tend to be more polarized, and this sentiment endures post-election.

To overcome this issue, high-rate quantum codes, such as quantum low-density parity-check codes, have been studied over the past decade. In this case, however, it is difficult to perform logical gates in parallel while maintaining low overheads. Here, we propose concatenated high-rate small-size quantum error-detecting codes as a family of high-rate quantum codes. Their simple structure allows for a geometrical interpretation using hypercubes corresponding to logical qubits. We thus call them many-hypercube codes. They can realize both high rates, e.g., 30% (64 logical qubits are encoded into 216 physical ones), and parallelizability of logical gates. Developing dedicated decoder and encoders, we achieve high error thresholds even in a circuit-level noise model. Thus, the many-hypercube codes will pave the way to high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computing."

In the mouse embryo, the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of PGC specification has been extensively characterized. However, the initial event that triggers the soma-germline segregation remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover a critical role for the basement membrane in regulating germline entry. We show that PGCs arise in a region of the mouse embryo that lacks contact with the basement membrane, and the addition of exogenous extracellular matrix (ECM) inhibits both PGC and PGC-like cell (PGCLC) specification in mouse embryos and stem cell models, respectively. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the engagement of β1 integrin with laminin blocks PGCLC specification by preventing the Wnt signaling–dependent down-regulation of the PGC transcriptional repressor, Otx2. In this way, the physical segregation of cells away from the basement membrane acts as a morphogenetic fate switch that controls the soma-germline bifurcation."

Here, we study the function of an evolutionary conserved editing site inDrosophila, located in glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluClα). Our findings reveal that flies lacking editing at this site exhibit reduced olfactory responses to odors and impaired pheromone-dependent social interactions. Moreover, we demonstrate that editing of this site is crucial for the proper processing of olfactory information in projection neurons.

Here, we examined different Tregcell subsets regarding their fate, epigenomic stability, transcriptomes, T cell receptor repertoires, and function ex vivo and after manufacturing. Each Tregcell subset displayed distinct features, including lineage stability, epigenomics, surface markers, T cell receptor diversity, and transcriptomics. Earlier-differentiated memory Tregcell populations, including a hitherto unidentified naïve-like memory Tregcell subset, outperformed late-differentiated effector memory–like Tregcells in regulatory function, proliferative capacity, and epigenomic stability. High yields of stable, functional Tregcell products could be achieved by depleting the small effector memory–like Tregcell subset before manufacturing.

These include economic, political and climate forcing factors, all of which require quantification. Here, we focus on the climate forcing, and in particular, the soil moisture change component which crucially determines water availability for crop uptake. We estimate future soil moisture levels at 34 sites of the UK COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS-UK) network. We do this by combining three platforms: the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model, field-scale soil moisture observations from the COSMOS-UK stations and 2.2 km convection-permitting UK Climate Projections (UKCP18). We use COSMOS-UK data to optimise key soil moisture-related parameters in the JULES model, based on its performance in the contemporary period. We then force the calibrated model with UKCP18 data to produce future soil moisture estimates. We evaluate the modelled soil moisture for an average soil depth between 0 and 35 cm to match the depth of soil moisture observations. Our main conclusions concern future soil moisture droughts which we compare with equivalent events in the historical period, 1982–2000. We find that on average across all sites, there is an increase in the frequency of future extreme soil moisture drought events of duration above 90 days. In 2062–80, such frequency increase of between 0.1 and 0.6 events per year (equivalent to at least 2 and up to 12 additional events in a 20-year period) is expected. We also show that, in 2062–80, there is an increased risk of high or more intense soil moisture drought conditions in months between May and November, with months between June and October being at especially high risk.

 The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been widely used for various applications, especially for solving mesoscale atmospheric dynamics. Its high-order numerical schemes and nesting capability enable high spatial resolution. However, a growing number of applications are demanding more realistic simulations through the incorporation of coupling with new model compartments and an increase in the complexity of the processes considered in the model. (e.g., ocean, surface gravity wave, land-surface, chemistry...). The present paper details the development and the functionalities of the coupling interface we implemented in WRF. It uses the Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea-Ice-Soil – Model Coupling Toolkit (OASIS3-MCT) coupler, which has the advantage of being non-intrusive, efficient, and very flexible to use. OASIS3-MCT has already been implemented in many climate and regional models. This coupling interface is designed with the following baselines: (1) it is structured with a 2-level design through 2 modules: a general coupling module, and a coupler-specific module, allowing to easily add other couplers if required, (2) variables exchange, coupling frequency, and any potential time and grid transformations are controlled through an external text file, offering great flexibility, (3) the concepts of “external domains” and “coupling mask” are introduced to facilitate the exchange of fields to/from multiple sources (different models, fields from different models/grids/zooms...). Finally, two examples of applications of ocean-atmosphere coupling are proposed. The first is related to the impact of ocean surface current feedback to the atmospheric boundary layer, and the second concerns the coupling of surface gravity waves with the atmospheric surface layer."

Sturchio,Dynamic Surface Incorporation of Pb2+ Ions at the Actively Dissolving Calcite (104) Surface,"The reaction of dissolved Pb2+ with calcite surfaces at near-equilibrium conditions involves adsorption of Pb2+ and precipitation of secondary heteroepitaxial Pb-carbonate minerals. A more complex behavior is observed under far-from-equilibrium conditions, including strong inhibition of calcite dissolution, development of microtopography, and near-surface incorporation of multiple monolayers (ML) of Pb2+ without precipitation of secondary phases [where 1 ML ≡ 1 Ca/20.2 Å2, the crystallographic site density of the calcite (104) lattice plane]. However, the mechanistic controls governing far-from-equilibrium reactivity are not well understood. Here, we observe the interfacial incorporation of dissolved Pb2+ during the dissolution of calcite (104) surfaces at pH ∼ 3.7 in a flow-through reaction cell, revealing the formation of a ∼1 nm thick Pb-rich calcite layer with a total Pb coverage of ∼1.4 ML. These observations of the sorbed Pb distribution used resonant anomalous X-ray reflectivity, X-ray fluorescence, and nanoinfrared atomic force microscopy. We propose that this altered surface layer represents a novel sorption mode that is stabilized by conditions of sustained disequilibrium. This behavior may significantly impact the transport of dissolved metals during disequilibrium processes occurring in acid mine drainage and subsurface CO2 injection and, if appropriately accounted for, could improve the predictive capability of geochemical reactive-transport models."

Engineering data show that fluctuations in environmental temperature cause the reactor temperature to drop at night, resulting in increased dissolved oxygen concentration and improved effluent wastewater quality. However, the impact of natural temperature variation on wastewater treatment systems and the energy-saving potential has yet to be fully recognized. Here, we conducted a comprehensive study, using a full-scale oxic-hydrolytic and denitrification-oxic (OHO) coking wastewater treatment process as a case and developed a dynamic aeration model integrating thermodynamics and kinetics to elucidate the energy-saving mechanisms of wastewater treatment systems in response to diurnal temperature variations. Our case study results indicate that natural diurnal temperature variations can cut the energy consumption of 660,980 kWh annually (up to 30%) for the aeration unit in the OHO system. Wastewater treatment facilities located in regions with significant environmental temperature variation stand to benefit more from this energy-saving mechanism.

To enable this, we constructed and curated thousands of metagenome-assembled and isolate genomes from drinking water distribution systems globally to develop a Drinking Water Genome Catalog (DWGC). The current DWGC disproportionately represents disinfected drinking water systems due to a paucity of metagenomes from nondisinfected systems. Using the DWGC, we identify core genera of the drinking water microbiome including a genus (UBA4765) within the order Rhizobiales that is frequently detected and highly abundant in disinfected drinking water systems. We demonstrate that this genus has been widely detected but incorrectly classified in previous amplicon sequencing-based investigations of the drinking water microbiome. Further, we show that a single genome variant (genomovar) within this genus is detected in 75% of drinking water systems included in this study. We propose a name for this uncultured bacterium as “Raskinella chloraquaticus” and describe the genus as “Raskinella” (endorsed by SeqCode).

In this study, pregnant ICR mice were exposed to 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) in drinking water from gestation to lactation to investigate its effects on autism spectrum disorder-like (ASD-like) behaviors in offspring. Serum EHDPP concentrations in dams in the 0.4, 2, and 10 mg/kg groups were 0.282 ± 0.051, 0.713 ± 0.115, and 0.974 ± 0.048 ng/mL, respectively, within the concentration range in humans. At the highest dose, EHDPP exposure induced ASD-like behaviors in both female and male offspring. Significant reductions in mature dendritic spines and structural damage to the postsynaptic density zone were noted in all but the lowest exposure groups, indicating postsynaptic membrane impairment. Mechanistically, EHDPP significantly downregulated disc large MAGUK scaffold protein 4 expression by inhibiting protein kinase B and type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor phosphorylation. In the heterologous synapse formation assay in vivo, EHDPP significantly reduced the levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 expression in neurons at 1 μM.

Here, we used a field survey, a reciprocal cross-transplant experiment, and a laboratory toxicity experiment to build a compelling case that exposure to the insecticide chlorpyrifos was responsible for differences in snail (Bellamya aeruginosa) densities in eastern (ELL) and western basins of Liangzi Lake in China. Our field survey and reciprocal cross-transplant experiment revealed significant differences in snail densities, juvenile percentage, survival, and relative telomere length (RTL) in the two basins. The insecticide chlorpyrifos detected in snail tissues was negatively correlated with snail densities, the percentage of juvenile snails, and RTL and had an extremely high risk quotient in ELL. In the laboratory experiment, tissue concentrations of chlorpyrifos detected in ELL were associated with reduced RTL and increased juvenile mortality in B. aeruginosa. These results support the hypothesis that chlorpyrifos exposure in ELL reduced the density of snails by reducing juvenile survival and, consequently, recruitment to the adult population."

Recently, elevated levels of reactive chlorine species during bleach cleaning and disinfection have been reported to increase indoor oxidative capacity. However, incomplete knowledge of the indoor transformation of limonene, especially the missing chlorine chemistry, poses a barrier to evaluating the environmental implications associated with the concurrent use of cleaning agents and disinfectants. Here, we investigated the reaction mechanisms of chlorinated limonene peroxy radicals (Cl-lim-RO2•), key intermediates in determining the chlorine chemistry of limonene, and toxicity of transformation products (TPs) using quantum chemical calculations and toxicology modeling. The results indicate that Cl-lim-RO2• undergoes a concerted autoxidation process modulated by RO2• and alkoxy radicals (RO•), particularly emphasizing the importance of RO• isomerization. Following this generalized autoxidation mechanism, Cl-lim-RO2• can produce low-volatility precursors of secondary organic aerosols. Toxicological findings further indicate that the majority of TPs exhibit increased respiratory toxicity, mutagenicity, and eye/skin irritation compared to limonene, presenting an occupational hazard for indoor occupants. The proposed near-explicit reaction mechanism of chlorine-initiated limonene significantly enhances our current understanding of both RO2• and RO• chemistry while also highlighting the health risks associated with the concurrent use of cleaning agents and disinfectants."

A novel catchment particle balance approach was used, incorporating inputs from atmospheric deposition and stream inflows against lake outflow and sedimentation. This approach provides the first reported observation-based estimates of microplastic residence time in freshwater lakes. Atmospheric deposition had the highest daily microplastic flux (3.95–8.09 mp/m2/day), compared to the inflow streams (2.21–2.34 mp/m2/day), suggesting that it is the dominant source of microplastics to rural regions. Approximately 44–71% of the deposited microplastics were retained in the terrestrial catchments and 30–49% of the microplastics in the stream inflows were retained in the study lakes. Given that output fluxes ranged from 0.72–3.76 mp/m2/day in the sediment and 1.18–1.66 mp/m2/day in the lake outflows, the microplastic residence time was estimated to be between 3 and 12 years, suggesting that lakes are an important reservoir for microplastics. Fibers were the dominant shape in atmospheric deposition, streamwater, and lake water; however, in lake sediment, there was a higher proportion of fragments. Across all media, poly(ethylene terephthalate) was the dominant polymer identified (23%)."

It primarily manifests in the form of pulmonary nodules, but not all will develop into lung cancer. Therefore, it is highly desired to distinguish between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules for the early prevention and treatment of lung cancer. Currently, histopathological examination is the gold standard for classifying pulmonary nodules, which is invasive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. This study proposes a metallomics approach through synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) with a simplified one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) to distinguish pulmonary nodules by using serum samples. SRXRF spectra of serum samples were obtained and preliminarily analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). Subsequently, machine learning algorithms (MLs) and 1DCNN were applied to develop classification models. Both MLs and 1DCNN based on full-channel spectra could distinguish patients with benign and malignant pulmonary nodules, but the highest accuracy rate of 96.7% was achieved when using 1DCNN. In addition, it was found that characteristic elements in serum from patients with malignant nodules were different from those in benign nodules, which can serve as the fingerprint metallome profile. The simplified model based on characteristic elements resulted in good performance of sensitivity and F1-score > 91.30%, G-mean, MCC and Kappa > 85.59%, and accuracy = 94.34%. In summary, metallomic classification of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules using serum samples can be achieved through 1DCNN-boosted SRXRF, which is easy to handle and much less invasive compared to histopathological examination."

It is essential such models accurately represent MCSs, and in particular environmental interactions such as dynamical control by wind shear. We show that in representative current generation CP simulations, MCS updraft entrainment decreases with shear, leading to a realistic increase of extreme rainfall. We find the control of environmental shear extends to mean storm rainfall and anvil heights. The simulation of these effects depends strongly on model physics in both CP and parameterized models.

This simulation was conducted with a horizontal resolution of 100 m and employed a vertically stretched grid, achieving a resolution of 1 m at the lowest levels. Two distinct wind regimes were identified, characterized by katabatic flows prevailing within a 30 m thick layer during nighttime, and an anabatic flow manifesting within a layer spanning from 150 to 200 m during the daytime. The simulation was confirmed through validation with surface measurements, and thus enabling a detailed study of thermal breeze circulations. Results reveal that the intensity of trade winds significantly influences the development of thermal circulations. Complex layered structures in the atmosphere were also identified. At an intensity of 7 m s−1, trade winds impede the development of thermal circulations atop the slope, and result in the emergence of a convergence zone between local and regional circulations. The analysis of the breeze establishment period indicates that the katabatic flow stabilizes in 35 min, quicker than the anabatic flow, which takes 110 min.

However, the behavior of the Antarctic Ice Sheet beyond 2100 remains largely unknown: several instability mechanisms can develop on longer time scales, potentially destabilizing large parts of Antarctica. Projections of Antarctic Ice Sheet evolution until 2300 are presented here, using an ensemble of 16 ice‐flow models and forcing from global climate models. Under high‐emission scenarios, the Antarctic sea‐level contribution is limited to less than 30 cm sea‐level equivalent (SLE) by 2100, but increases rapidly thereafter to reach up to 4.4 m SLE by 2300. Simulations including ice‐shelf collapse lead to an additional 1.1 m SLE on average by 2300, and can reach 6.9 m SLE. Widespread retreat is observed on that timescale in most West Antarctic basins, leading to a collapse of large sectors of West Antarctica by 2300 in 30%–40% of the ensemble. While the onset date of retreat varies among ice models, the rate of upstream propagation is highly consistent once retreat begins. Calculations of sea‐level contribution including water density corrections lead to an additional ∼10% sea level and up to 50% for contributions accounting for bedrock uplift in response to ice loading. Overall, these results highlight large sea‐level contributions from Antarctica and suggest that the choice of ice sheet model remains the leading source of uncertainty in multi‐century projections."

Although stunting causes have been documented, we still lack a more in‐depth understanding of their local factors at a more detailed geographic level. We cross‐sectionally examined 615 height‐for‐age prevalence observations in the Northern Province of Rwanda, linked with their related covariates, to explore the spatial heterogeneity in the low height‐for‐age prevalence by fitting linear and non‐linear spatial regression models and explainable machine learning. Specifically, complemented with generalized additive models, we fitted the ordinary least squares (OLS), a standard geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models to characterize the imbalanced distribution of stunting risk factors and uncover the nonlinear effect of significant predictors, explaining the height‐for‐age variations. The results reveal that 27% of the children measured were stunted, and that likelihood was found to be higher in the districts of Musanze, Gakenke, and Gicumbi. The local MGWR model outperformed the ordinary GWR and OLS, with coefficients of determination of 0.89, 0.84, and 0.25, respectively. At specific ranges, the study shows that height‐for‐age decreases with an increase in the number of days a child was left alone, elevation, and rainfall. In contrast, land surface temperature is positively associated with height‐for‐age. However, variables like the normalized difference vegetation index, slope, soil fertility, and urbanicity exhibited bell‐shaped and U‐shaped non‐linear associations with the height‐for‐age prevalence. Identifying areas with the highest rates of stunting will help determine the most effective measures for reducing the burden of undernutrition."

However, suppressing interfacial recombination at the wide-bandgap perovskite/electron transport layer interface, without compromising its superior charge transport performance, remains a significant challenge for perovskite-silicon tandem cells3,4.

We constructed perovskite-silicon tandem devices on double-side textured Czochralski (CZ)-based silicon heterojunction cell, which featured a mildly-textured front surface and a heavily-textured rear surface, leading to simultaneously enhanced photocurrent and uncompromised rear passivation. The resulting perovskite-silicon tandem achieved an independently certified stabilized PCE of 33.89%, accompanied by an impressive fill factor (FF) of 83.0% and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of nearly 1.97 volts.

 Rivers are a key component of the global carbon cycle. They receive vast quantities of terrestrial carbon, of which a large fraction is ultimately exported to the coastal ocean. Our review of previously published assessments reveals that substantial uncertainties remain with regard to the spatial distribution and speciation of the carbon export. Accurate quantification of the relative contributions of dissolved, particulate, organic and inorganic carbon to the total amounts is, however, of crucial importance for the coupling between the terrestrial and marine carbon cycles. Breaking down existing spatially explicit assessments over large river basins, we find a disagreement in flux estimates that exceeds two orders of magnitude for more than half of the basins. Using machine-learning techniques in combination with a multi-model ensemble and an updated database of observations, we overcome the inconsistencies in existing assessments and narrow down uncertainties in riverine carbon exports. Our revised assessment yields a global riverine export of 1.02 ± 0.22 (2σ) PgC yr−1. This carbon flux is partitioned into 0.52 ± 0.17, 0.30 ± 0.14, 0.18 ± 0.04 and 0.03 ± 0.02 PgC yr−1 of dissolved inorganic, dissolved organic, particulate organic and particulate inorganic carbon, respectively. We estimate the carbon contribution through groundwater export to be minor (0.016 PgC yr−1). Our assessment suggests an underestimation of the land-to-ocean carbon flux by 0.24 PgC yr−1 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and calls for a revision of the oceanic carbon budget.

 Floquet engineering is a promising tool to manipulate quantum systems coherently. A well-known example is the optical Stark effect, which has been used for optical trapping of atoms and breaking time-reversal symmetry in solids. However, as a coherent nonlinear optical effect, Floquet engineering typically requires high field intensities obtained in ultrafast pulses, severely limiting its use. Here, we demonstrate using cavity engineering of the vacuum modes to achieve orders-of-magnitude enhancement of the effective Floquet field, enabling Floquet effects at an extremely low fluence of 450 photons/μm2. At higher fluences, the cavity-enhanced Floquet effects lead to 50 meV spin and valley splitting of WSe2 excitons, corresponding to an enormous time-reversal breaking, non-Maxwellian magnetic field of over 200 T. Utilizing such an optically controlled effective magnetic field, we demonstrate an ultrafast, picojoule chirality XOR gate. These results suggest that cavity-enhanced Floquet engineering may enable the creation of steady-state or quasi-equilibrium Floquet bands, strongly non-perturbative modifications of materials beyond the reach of other means, and application of Floquet engineering to a wide range of materials and applications.

 The artificial photocatalytic synthesis based on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for H2O2 production is evolving rapidly. However, the simultaneous production of high-value products at electron and hole sites remains a great challenge. Here, we use transformable potassium iodide to obtain semi-crystalline g-C3N4 integrated with the I-/I3- redox shuttle mediators for efficient generation of H2O2 and benzaldehyde.

 Bees provide crucial pollination services for crop cultivation, contributing billions of dollars to the global agricultural economy. However, exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids represents a major problem for bee health, necessitating strategies that can improve agricultural sustainability and pollinator health. Here we report a simple and scalable solution, through ingestible hydrogel microparticles (IHMs), which can capture neonicotinoids in vitro and in the bee gastrointestinal tract to mitigate the harmful effects of pesticides. Using the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) as a model species and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, we demonstrated by means of lethal and sublethal assays the substantial benefits of IHM treatments. Under lethal exposure of imidacloprid, bumblebees that received IHM treatment exhibited a 30% increase in survival relative to groups without IHM treatment. After a sublethal exposure of 5 ng, IHM treatment resulted in improved feeding motivation and a 44% increase in the number of bees that engaged in locomotor activity. Wingbeat frequency was significantly lower after a single 5 or 10 ng imidacloprid dose; however, IHM treatment improved wingbeat frequency. Overall, the IHMs improved bumblebee health, and with further optimization have the potential to benefit apiculture and reduce risk during crop pollination by managed bees.

 Methane is a potent but relatively short-lived greenhouse gas, with anthropogenic and natural sources and rapidly increasing atmospheric concentrations. Hence, it is an important target for reducing emissions and increasing sinks, as doing so could notably reduce rates of climate change in the near-term. This includes potentially enhancing methanotrophy, a microbial process of methane oxidation that occurs broadly in aquatic environments, in soils and on foliar and bark surfaces. Methanotrophy can be an important sink where it intercepts relatively high concentrations of methane produced from within soils or water bodies, but when methanotrophs are exposed to only ambient atmospheric methane concentrations (about 2 ppm), methane oxidation occurs at very slow rates. Here we present an assessment of possible strategies – including introduction of exogenous microbes to soils and plant tissues, improved tillage and nutrient management in agriculture, and reforestation – to enhance rates of methanotrophy for removal of atmospheric methane, where the low concentration constrains the energy available to support methanotrophic growth.

 Speleothem trace element records can provide seasonal resolution climate reconstructions, but the interpretation can be challenging. Aragonite samples are understudied compared to calcite samples, despite that aragonite has 10x higher uranium concentrations and thus provide excellent dating precision. Here we present a high-resolution dataset of drip water trace elements (calcium, magnesium, strontium, barium, uranium) that are commonly affected by prior carbonate (calcite / aragonite) precipitation, a process often driven by effective rainfall. Our data suggest that prior calcite and aragonite precipitation can occur at the same drip site complicating the interpretation of strontium and uranium concentrations in aragonite speleothems. However, both processes can be distinguished with the “Sinclair test” through the trendline analysis of logarithmic relationships. Furthermore, our data show that aragonite speleothems slowly growing under relatively constant conditions are ideal to record variations in prior carbonate precipitation with its barium concentrations, independent from the prior carbonate precipitation mode.

10.1016/j.rse.2024.114377,False,Remote Sensing of Environment,这篇研究主要关注利用合成孔径雷达（SAR）技术区分沼泽地和陆地森林以及灌木丛。研究重点在于分析不同SAR传感器参数（波长、极化方式、入射角等）以及时间因素对识别沼泽地和干燥陆地植被的影响，以及数字高程模型（DEM）在提高识别准确率方面的作用。研究没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。,"['SAR', 'remote sensing', 'wetlands', 'swamps', 'forests', 'shrublands', 'digital elevation model', 'DEM']",Sarah Banks;Koreen Millard;Laura Dingle-Robertson;Jason Duffe,New insights into distinguishing temperate deciduous swamps from upland forests and shrublands with SAR,"•Challenge preconception long wavelengths ideal for separating swamps from dry wooded uplands. •Optimally timed SAR data, even if at shorter wavelengths, can perform equally well. •Close scrutiny needed when selecting SAR data, or temper interpretation against biases. •Including a DEM and its derivatives can partially compensate for use of sub-optimal SAR data. 
 Although wetlands are widely recognized for thier important role in providing ecosystem services, their abundance, spatial extent, and condition remain poorly constrained and at-risk of decline. Accurate mapping and monitoring are therefore essential for their protection. However, distinguishing swamps from upland forests and shrublands is especially challenging because optical sensors cannot detect water and/or saturated soil under dense canopies. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers distinct advantages in this regard: (1) under certain conditions, microwaves can penetrate vegetation and provide a strong backscattered signal from double bounce when surface water or very wet soil are present, and (2) microwaves can penetrate clouds, providing an opportunity to monitor changes in moisture or the extent of flooding through time. In spite of these advantages, users may still find it difficult to know which wavelengths, incidence angles, polarization states, and times of year can be used to detect swamps because of the complexity of choices, and some confusing and conflicting results presented in the literature. The goal of this research was therefore to better elucidate the impacts of sensor and environmental characteristics on the seasonal backscattering behaviour observed in and separability between swamps and dry, upland forests and shrublands, as well as determine the need for additional ancillary data like digital elevation models and derivatives to improve mapping accuracy. Using SAR data from three sensors with two different wavelengths, various polarization states, and a range of incidence angles we: (1) investigate the drivers of variations in seasonal trends and the frequency and timing of changes among different SAR time series, and assess their impact on separability, (2) quantify the importance of acquisition timing, type, number of derivatives on the accuracy of Random Forest models. Our results show that a common pre-conception that longer wavelengths are preferred for distinguishing flooded versus upland forests and shrublands has proven overly general, that data acquired before leaf flush in the spring provides superior results, and that DEM data only provides an advantage when using sub-optimal SAR data."
10.1016/j.jag.2024.104140,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,该研究主要关注利用高光谱影像提取海岸泥滩。研究提出了一个泥滩指数（MFI），通过放大泥滩与其他土地覆盖类型之间的光谱差异，有效区分了泥滩、盐沼、红树林和泥水。研究使用ZY1-02D、GF-5、PRISMA和Hyperion等卫星数据，并与SVM和RF等机器学习方法进行比较，证明了MFI方法在提取泥滩方面具有更高的精度和效率。,"['hyperspectral images', 'mudflat', 'coastal', 'remote sensing', 'ZY1-02D', 'GF-5', 'PRISMA', 'Hyperion', 'Support Vector Machine', 'Random Forest']",Gang Yang;Chunchen Shao;Yangyan Zuo;Weiwei Sun;Ke Huang;Lihua Wang;Binjie Chen;Xiangchao Meng;Yong Ge,MFI: A mudflat index based on hyperspectral satellite images for mapping coastal mudflats,"•The MFI (Mudflat index) has been constructed for extracting coastal mudflat. •The decision tree model was designed by combining NDVI and prior knowledge. •The proposed method is suitable for fast and effective extraction of mudflats in coastal areas. 
 China’s coastal mudflats, threatened by artificial reclamation and climate change, are undergoing drastic changes and their accurate mapping is important for their conservation and restoration. Traditional classification methods, which require large samples and complex classifiers, tend to have low computational efficiency and poor generalization ability; thus, they are unsuitable for the rapid and accurate extraction of coastal mudflats. This study proposes a Mudflat Index (MFI) based on hyperspectral images. MFI amplifies the difference in spectral characteristics between mudflats and other land cover types in intertidal environments, effectively improving the discrimination between coastal mudflats, salt marshes, mangroves, and muddy waters. Four typical coastal mudflat areas (i.e., the Yellow River Delta in Shandong, the Radial Sand Ridges of the South Yellow Sea in Jiangsu, Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang, and the Qinzhou Bay-Nanliu River Estuary in Guangxi) based on ZY1-02D were selected as the study areas. The extraction accuracies in the four study areas are 97.60%, 96.88%, 97.16% and 96.97%, respectively. The further extraction experiments were calculated based on hyperspectral data from GF-5, PRISMA, and Hyperion. Sample datasets were produced using field surveys and Google Earth high-resolution imagery. Compared to the Hyperspectral Bare Soil Index (HBSI), Normalized Difference Bare Soil Index (NDBSI) and Microphytobenthos Index (MPBI), MFI demonstrates superior performance with average SDI value improvements of 0.82, 0.71 and 1.17, respectively, in distinguishing mudflats from other typical land cover types in the intertidal zone. The extraction results were also compared with those derived from Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifications, showing that MFI outperformed SVM and RF by an average of 1.52% and 0.58%. The results show that MFI can be applied to different hyperspectral remote sensing images and different areas of mudflat extraction. The MFI-based method is simple, fast and accurate at extracting the mudflat in the intertidal environment."

Bratley;Curtis E.

 Increasing population and the consequent rise in the demand for food and water resources pose significant challenges for the future of agriculture in Egypt. Rapid large-scale agricultural expansion has occurred in the country to meet the growing demand, but agricultural loss from urban infringement and field abandonment remains prevalent. Documenting the full spectrum of changes within Egypt’s agricultural systems is crucial for developing effective land-use policies that improve food security. Here we map and estimate the areal extent of multiple types of agricultural change in Egypt (i.e., agricultural gain, agricultural abandonment, and agricultural loss from urban growth) by applying the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm, a widely used time series temporal segmentation algorithm. First, we used LandTrendr to identify areas of agricultural gain and loss throughout Egypt from 1987 to 2019. Second, we combined land-cover maps and the LandTrendr results to create a comprehensive land-cover change map. Lastly, we evaluated the accuracy of our findings and estimated per-class areas with quantified uncertainty using high-quality reference data. Our results reveal a notable expansion in Egypt’s agricultural land area. However, this growth is accompanied by the widespread loss of prime agricultural land, a consequence of urban development and agricultural abandonment. This study emphasizes the pressing need for the implementation of sustainable land-use policies in Egypt, particularly as climate change will exacerbate pressures on the agricultural sector in the future."

 Continuous operating reference station (CORS) networks, underpinned by GNSS technology, support various technological services including comprehensive surveying, navigation, and remote sensing. The stability of these CORS networks is crucial for maintaining the high accuracy and reliability of data services. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the GPS deformation array of Vancouver Island, Canada, and present a thorough stability analysis scheme for CORS networks that is adaptable to other areas with frequent tectonic activity. For this study, we first conducted a data quality assessment based on three primary indices — namely, multipath effect on L1 and L2 frequency, signal-to-noise ratio in both frequency and cycle slip ratio — using the Transfer Edit Quality Check (TEQC) software. Then, we achieved high-precision data processing using the GAMIT/GLOBK software, in order to quantify the changes at each station over the specific periods. Seasonality analysis was also incorporated into the pipeline. Considering the potential variances affecting the deformation array over time, the coordinates were transformed under a unified reference frame, enabling the study of changes with station coordinates from different epochs under the same systematic conditions. Additionally, the impact of plate tectonic was examined through correlation analysis. The results showed that, while the observation data from the QUAD station in the island deformation array are of poor quality, relative stability was maintained within the deformation array. The PTRF and CLRS stations exhibited vertical instability in the fall season, while the QUAD station showed a weaker instability trend. The remaining stations maintained good stability with closer stations demonstrating stronger consistency in their displacement. In terms of plate tectonic, the deformation array stations exhibit a similar southwestward displacement trend as the North American Plate in the horizontal direction, but no significant trend in the vertical direction."

 Accurate lane maps with semantics are crucial for various applications, such as high-definition maps (HD Maps), intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and digital twins. Manual annotation of lanes is labor-intensive and costly, prompting researchers to explore automatic lane extraction methods. This paper presents an end-to-end large-scale lane mapping method that considers both lane geometry and semantics. This study represents lane markings as polylines with uniformly sampled points and associated semantics, allowing for adaptation to varying lane shapes. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end network to extract lane polylines from mobile laser scanning (MLS) data, enabling the inference of vectorized lane instances without complex post-processing. The network consists of three components: a feature encoder, a column proposal generator, and a lane information decoder. The feature encoder encodes textual and structural information of lane markings to enhance the method’s robustness to data imperfections, such as varying lane intensity, uneven point density, and occlusion-induced incomplete data. The column proposal generator generates regions of interest for the subsequent decoder. Leveraging the embedded multi-scale features from the feature encoder, the lane decoder effectively predicts lane polylines and their associated semantics without requiring step-by-step conditional inference. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three lane datasets have demonstrated the performance of the proposed method, even in the presence of incomplete data and complex lane topology. Furthermore, the datasets used in this work, including source ground points, generated bird’s eye view (BEV) images, and annotations, will be publicly available with the publication of the paper. The code and dataset will be accessible through here."

Here, we describe computationally guided transition metal–ligand design that positions a hydrogen-bond acceptor anion at the reactive site to promote functionalization. A general cross-coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary aliphatic alcohols with terminal olefins to furnish >130 ethers is achieved. The mild conditions tolerate functionality that is prone to substitution, elimination, and epimerization and achieve site selectivity in polyol settings. Mechanistic studies support the hypothesis that the ligand’s geometry and electronics direct positioning of the phosphate anion at the π-allyl-palladium terminus, facilitating the phosphate’s hydrogen-bond acceptor role toward the alcohol. Ligand-directed counteranion positioning in cationic transition metal catalysis has the potential to be a general strategy for promoting challenging bimolecular reactivity."

Hui Shen",Single-cell chromatin accessibility reveals malignant regulatory programs in primary human cancers,"To identify cancer-associated gene regulatory changes, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility landscapes across eight tumor types as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Tumor chromatin accessibility is strongly influenced by copy number alterations that can be used to identify subclones, yet underlying cis-regulatory landscapes retain cancer type–specific features. Using organ-matched healthy tissues, we identified the “nearest healthy” cell types in diverse cancers, demonstrating that the chromatin signature of basal-like–subtype breast cancer is most similar to secretory-type luminal epithelial cells. Neural network models trained to learn regulatory programs in cancer revealed enrichment of model-prioritized somatic noncoding mutations near cancer-associated genes, suggesting that dispersed, nonrecurrent, noncoding mutations in cancer are functional. Overall, these data and interpretable gene regulatory models for cancer and healthy tissue provide a framework for understanding cancer-specific gene regulation."

Modifying skin identity has clinical potential, such as the conversion of residual limb and stump (nonvolar) skin of amputees to pressure-responsive palmoplantar (volar) skin to enhance prosthesis use and minimize skin breakdown. Greater keratin 9 (KRT9) expression, higher epidermal thickness, keratinocyte cytoplasmic size, collagen length, and elastin are markers of volar skin and likely contribute to volar skin resiliency. Given fibroblasts’ capacity to modify keratinocyte differentiation, we hypothesized that volar fibroblasts influence these features. Bioprinted skin constructs confirmed the capacity of volar fibroblasts to induce volar keratinocyte features.

However, whether it shapes coping strategies when facing future threats remains unknown. We found that mice that briefly observe a conspecific being harmed become resilient, withstanding behavioral despair after an adverse experience. Photometric recordings during negative emotional contagion revealed increased serotonin (5-HT) release in the lateral habenula. Whereas 5-HT and emotional contagion reduced habenular burst firing, limiting 5-HT synthesis prevented burst plasticity. Enhancing raphe-to-habenula 5-HT was sufficient to recapitulate resilience. In contrast, reducing 5-HT release in the habenula made witnessing a conspecific in distress ineffective to promote the resilient phenotype after adversity.

Minghao Zhuang",Climate change exacerbates the environmental impacts of agriculture,"Agriculture’s global environmental impacts are widely expected to continue expanding, driven by population and economic growth and dietary changes. This Review highlights climate change as an additional amplifier of agriculture’s environmental impacts, by reducing agricultural productivity, reducing the efficacy of agrochemicals, increasing soil erosion, accelerating the growth and expanding the range of crop diseases and pests, and increasing land clearing. We identify multiple pathways through which climate change intensifies agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, creating a potentially powerful climate change–reinforcing feedback loop. The challenges raised by climate change underscore the urgent need to transition to sustainable, climate-resilient agricultural systems. This requires investments that both accelerate adoption of proven solutions that provide multiple benefits, and that discover and scale new beneficial processes and food products."

This would create a new supply chain of domestically sourced lithium for the United States to produce lithium-based batteries that will help drive the transition to a renewable-based energy grid. Plans to expand geothermal production along with lithium extraction are being considered in the Salton Sea known geothermal resource area. We discuss water availability and quality issues and potential concerns about water pollution associated with this geothermal expansion and lithium production in the context of potential future restrictions on water extractions from the Colorado River Basin. We estimate that water demand for currently proposed geothermal production and lithium extraction facilities only accounts for ∼4% of the historical water supply in the region. Regional water allocation will be more impacted by the proposed cuts to the region’s water allocation from the Colorado River between now and 2050 than by expansion of geothermal production with associated lithium extraction. Accurately planning for water needs in the future will require more specific information about water demands of the lithium extraction and refining processes.

This makes effectively representing forest management decisions such as planting and harvesting important. Here, we implement a novel dynamic forest harvest model in a global state of the art multi-sector dynamics model, namely the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM). We implement an approach that explicitly tracks forest age and generates rotation ages for forest harvest that are responsive to changes in wood prices, changes in forest age and regional preferences for forest rotation. Furthermore, the forest sector in GCAM competes for investment with other land use types in the future years based on expected profit. Our baseline scenario results indicate that with the new forest harvest model, the current global wood product demand in GCAM can be met with minimal loss of old growth forest through the age-based harvest decisions. We find that economic pressure for deforestation and consequent loss of forest carbon is a bigger driver of global forest change than wood harvests, especially in developing regions. Under alternative scenarios where an economic value is placed on carbon across the terrestrial and energy systems, while there is an increase in forest plantations, there can be corresponding decreases in forest cover in some regions as forest land competes with land for bio-energy crops. When the carbon in forests is assigned a price, we find that the average rotation age for wood harvests can be reduced across regions to harvest forests in a more carbon efficient manner."

A sub-category of the literature studying groundwater-energy nexus tends to focus on groundwater depletion hotspots where entrenched interests and long-standing histories restrict the range of feasible energy pricing options. Using an agent-based model, we estimate the expected impact of expanding groundwater irrigation under five different energy provision models in Odisha, an Indian state with among the lowest irrigation coverage, and, therefore, is free of path-dependent policies. We find that aquifer properties play a crucial role in mediating the groundwater-energy nexus. In this study region, on average, the maximum volume of water that can be pumped from a well of a specific depth in an alluvial aquifer is approximately 150 times the volume that can be pumped from a well in a hard-rock aquifer. Therefore, the risk of over-consumption and aquifer depletion is a far greater challenge in alluvial than hard-rock aquifers. Risks of groundwater consumption and depletion can be limited in hard-rock aquifers provided the number and depths of wells can be controlled. Capital subsidies for well construction could be an effective policy to increase irrigated areas as long as economic incentives for digging deeper are not distorted. Our results imply that solar pumps are a relatively safe option for hard-rock regions where deep drawdowns naturally limit the extent of over-extraction. Solar pumps are also estimated to be among the most economical for expanding irrigation. Using a novel data set comprising biophysical and socioeconomic data, we find hard-rock regions to have limited irrigation coverage, high availability of annually replenishable groundwater, and high concentrations of marginalized farmers. Therefore, groundwater irrigation expansion in hard-rock areas could have dual benefits of ensuring future food security and targeting poverty reduction."

Farm-level management strategies play a critical role in mitigating the impacts of and consequences for farmer livelihoods and food security. While the impacts of extreme weather on crop yields are well documented in recent studies, these predominantly focused on expansive geographical scales and commonly overlooked the critical role of management practices in modulating the dynamics of weather-crop sensitivities. We fill this gap in the literature by using a unique dataset that explores the timely relationship between extreme weather and crop yields at farm level in the Netherlands. We cover 10 types of crops and elucidate the role of soil types, irrigation and nutrient application in modulating the relationship between extreme weather and crops, by estimating fixed-effects regression models. We show substantial impacts from drought during the growing- and harvesting period and excessive precipitation during the planting- and growing period. Severe droughts show significant ( ) reductions in yield for all crops, and lead to yield reductions up to 24 percent relative to average yields during the growing period. Meanwhile, eight crops show significant reductions in yield due to severe water excess during the planting period, with yield reductions up to 18 percent. Soils such as sand or loess amplify the negative impact of drought on crop yield, while softening the impact of excessive precipitation. Irrigation and to a lesser extent nutrient application are shown to moderately decrease the impact of extreme weather on crop yield. Our findings contribute valuable insights to guide local adaptation priorities which are critical given the projected increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather under climate change."

Previous studies have predominantly focused on real-time associations between SM, VPD, and carbon uptake, attributing SM as the principal driver of GPP variability due to its direct and indirect effects through VPD. Using an information theory-based process network approach, we discovered that the influence of past VPD, mediated through its effects on SM, emerges as the primary driver of GPP variability across tropical regions. The past VPD conditions influence GPP directly and also affect SM in real-time alongside GPP, which subsequently impacts GPP variability. Examining land-atmosphere feedback using information theory reveals that past VPD conditions influence SM, but not the reverse. These causal structures explain the consistent decline in GPP with increasing VPD trends observed in tropical regions, which are not consistent with SM trends. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering the influence of past VPD mediated by SM when analyzing complex land-vegetation-atmosphere interactions."

The high-alkalinity seawater would be generated using bipolar membrane electrodialysis technology to remove acid and the alkaline stream returned to the sea. Response of the receiving waters was evaluated using a shoreline resolving hydrodynamic model with biogeochemistry, and carbonate chemistry. Two sites, and two deployment scales, each with enhanced TA of 2997 mmol m−3 and a pH of 9 were simulated. The effects on air-sea CO2 flux and pH in the near-field as well as over the larger estuary wide domain were assessed. The large-scale deployment (addition of 164 Mmoles TA yr−1) in a small embayment (Sequim Bay, 12.5 km2) resulted in removal of 2066 T of CO2 (45% of total simulated) at rate of 3756 mmol m−2 yr−1, higher than the 63 mmol m−2 yr−1 required globally to remove 1.0 GT CO2 yr−1. It also reduced acidity in the bay, ΔpH ≈ +0.1 pH units, an amount comparable to the historic impacts of anthropogenic acidification in the Salish Sea. The mixing and dilution of added TA with distance from the source results in reduced CDR rates such that comparable amount 2176 T CO2 yr−1 was removed over >1000 fold larger area of the rest of the model domain. There is the potential for more removal occurring beyond the region modeled. The CDR from reduction of outgassing between October and May accounts for as much as 90% of total CDR simulated. Of the total, only 375 T CO2 yr−1 (8%) was from the open shelf portion of the model domain. With shallow depths limiting vertical mixing, nearshore estuarine waters may provide a more rapid removal of CO2 using alkalinity enhancement relative to deeper oceanic sites."

Previous studies using water isotope observations and modelling have highlighted the importance of understanding spatial and temporal isotopic variability for a quantitative interpretation of these tracers. Here we present the first results of a high-resolution regional dynamical model (at 1/12° horizontal resolution) developed for the Mediterranean Sea, one of the hotspots of ongoing climate change. 
 Stable water isotopes (δ18Ow and δDw) have been successfully implemented for the first time in a high-resolution model of the Mediterranean Sea (NEMO-MED12). In this numerical study, model results are compared with available in situ observations to evaluate the model performance of the present-day distribution of stable water isotopes and their relationship with salinity on a sub-basin scale. There is good agreement between the modelled and observed distributions of δ18Ow in the surface water. The model successfully simulates the observed east–west gradient of δ18Ow characterising surface, intermediate, and deep waters. The results also show good agreement between the simulated δDw and the in situ data. The δDw shows a strong linear relationship with δ18Ow (r2=0.98) and salinity (r2=0.94) for the whole Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, the modelled relationships between δ18Ow and salinity agree well with observations, with a weaker slope in the eastern basin than in the western basin. We investigate the relationship of the isotopic signature of the planktonic foraminifera shells (δ18Oc) with temperature and the influence of seasonality. Our results suggest a more quantitative use of δ18O records, combining reconstruction with modelling approaches."

Although addressing plastic pollution through the life-cycle approach is crucial, the environmental impacts of typical plastic additive-related chemicals in PVC plastics during the cradle-to-gate stage remain unexplored. Consequently, managing the life-cycle environmental impacts of these additives remains challenging. Herein, the environmental impacts of 23 typical plastic additive-related chemicals and six PVC plastic products were evaluated throughout the cradle-to-gate life-cycle stage using a life cycle assessment–material flow analysis (LCA-MFA) coupled model. The results indicate that plastic additives significantly contribute to the environmental impacts of PVC plastic products across various end point indicators, ranging from 8.7 to 40.6%. Additionally, scenario analysis (SA) reveals that conventional strategies for addressing plastic pollution may not be highly effective in mitigating the environmental impacts associated with plastic additives. Specifically, compared to primary polymers, these additives exhibit 4 to 13% lower mitigation potential under the same policy scenarios. However, technical adjustment strategies targeting additives show a mitigation potential of 12 to 39%, suggesting that guiding the plastic additive industry toward green transformation is a key strategy for reducing environmental impacts."

Intermediates with terminal oxo ligands can undergo the oxygen atom exchange process with water molecules, whereas peroxides are unable to induce such exchanges. Therefore, these distinct metal–oxygen complexes can be distinguished based on the above feature. In this study, we identified previously unknown intermediates with a peroxy moiety and cobalt center that were generated during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation via aqueous CoII ions under acidic conditions. Results of theoretical calculations and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy revealed that the CoII ion tended to coordinate with the PMS anion to form a bidentate complex with a tetrahedral structure. These reactive cobalt intermediates were collectively named the CoII-PMS* complex. Depending on the inherent characteristics of the target contaminants, the CoII-PMS* complex can directly oxidize organic compounds or trigger PMS disproportionation to release hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals for collaborative decontamination. This work provides a comparative study between iron- and cobalt-based Fenton-like processes and proposes novel insights from the standpoint of diverse metal–oxygen complexes."

Herein, we placed earthworms in soils contaminated with different concentrations (0.02% and 0.2% w/w) of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) MPs to investigate the effect of earthworms on tomato against Helicoverpa armigera (H. armigera) under MPs stress. We found that earthworms alleviated the inhibitory effects of MPs stress on tomato growth and disrupted H. armigera growth. Compared to individual MPs exposure, earthworm incorporation significantly increased the silicon and lignin content in herbivore-damaged tomato leaves by 19.1% and 57.6%, respectively. Metabolites involved in chemical defense (chlorogenic acid) and phytohormones (jasmonic acid) were also activated by earthworm incorporation. Furthermore, earthworms effectively reduced oxidative damage induced by H. armigera via promoting antioxidant metabolism. Overall, our results suggest that utilizing earthworms to regulate above- and below-ground interactions could be a promising strategy for promoting green agriculture."

Here, we applied high-resolution chemical exposomics to plasma of 46 adults, each sampled 6 times over 2 years in a multiomic cohort, resulting in 276 individual exposomes. In addition to quantitative analysis of 83 priority target analytes, we discovered and semiquantified substances that have rarely or never been reported in humans, including personal care products, pesticide transformation products, and polymer additives. Hierarchical cluster analysis for 519 confidently annotated substances revealed unique and distinctive coexposures, including clustered pesticides, poly(ethylene glycols), chlorinated phenols, or natural substances from tea and coffee; interactive heatmaps were publicly deposited to support open exploration of the complex (meta)data. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for all annotated substances demonstrated the relatively low stability of the exposome compared to that of proteome, microbiome, and endogenous small molecules.

However, collecting representative eDNA samples from these high and complex environments remains challenging. Traditional methods, such as surface swabbing or tree rolling, are labor-intensive and require significant effort to achieve adequate coverage. This study proposes a novel approach for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect eDNA within tree canopies by using a surface swabbing technique. The method involves lowering a probe from a hovering UAV into the canopy and collecting eDNA as it descends and ascends through branches and leaves. To achieve this, a custom-designed robotic system was developed featuring a winch and a probe for eDNA collection. The design of the probe was optimized, and a control logic for the winch was developed to reduce the risk of entanglement while ensuring sufficient interaction force to facilitate transfer of eDNA onto the probe. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated during the XPRIZE Rainforest Semi-Finals as 10 eDNA samples were collected from the rainforest canopy, and a total of 152 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) were identified using eDNA metabarcoding. We further investigate how the number of probe interactions with vegetation, the penetration depth, and the sampling duration influence the DNA concentration and community composition of the samples."

The oxidizing capacity of the Ni catalyst/oxyanion varied depending on the oxyanion type. Ni catalyst/PMS (or HOCl) degraded a broad spectrum of organics, whereas PDS enabled selective phenol oxidation. This stemmed from the differential reactivity of two high-valent Ni intermediates, Ni(III) and Ni(IV). A high similarity with Ni(III)OOH in a substrate-specific reactivity indicated the role of Ni(III) as the primary oxidant of Ni-activated PDS. With the minor progress of redox reactions with radical probes and multiple spectroscopic evidence on moderate Ni(III) accumulation, the significant elimination of non-phenolic contaminants by NiOOH/PMS (or HOCl) suggested the involvement of Ni(IV) in the substrate-insensitive treatment capability of Ni catalyst/PMS (or HOCl). Since the electron-transfer oxidation of organics by high-valent Ni species involved Ni(II) regeneration, the loss of the treatment efficiency of Ni/oxyanion was marginal over multiple catalytic cycles."

The initial shift to the negative phase of Tropical Pacific Decadal Variability (TPDV) is primarily driven by the upward and eastward migration of isopycnal negative temperature anomalies along the equator. Subsequently, the wind fields associated with the negative phase of the Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM) induce anomalous vertical currents in the equatorial Pacific. This leads to anomalous upwelling and downwelling of mean temperature in the Niño4 and Niño3 regions, respectively, thereby strengthening and weakening the corresponding subsurface‐produced sea surface temperature anomalies.

Specifically, it aims to improve our understanding of how both the clouds and the relatively cool, moist afternoon sea breeze impact the Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Heat Index (HI). During the warm season, the afternoon sea breeze phenomenon in this coastal city acts as a natural air conditioner for city residents, facilitating the dispersion of moisture, heat, and pollutants. To investigate the relationship among urbanization, clouds, and land‐sea interactions, we conducted cloud‐ and urban‐resolving simulations at a 900 m grid resolution and perform simulation scenarios aiming to isolate urbanization, clouds and land‐sea circulations. Results show that urbanization correlates with the presence of shallow cumulus clouds, higher cloud bases, and increased cloud duration over the Galveston‐Houston region compared to rural areas. These urban clouds benefit from the enhanced moist static energy that is favored by intensifying vertical mixing and moisture flux convergence. Urbanization raises the mean HI while mitigating its afternoon HI high. We found that the urban circulation dome overwhelms the sensitivity of the sea breeze to the urbanization. Instead, the influence of urbanization on cloud enhancement emerges as a crucial pathway responsible for reducing the high afternoon HI values. Moreover, uncertainties in SSTs are closely linked to the sensitivities of land‐sea circulations, which in turn modulate UHI and HI."

The Arctic SIC‐forced teleconnection is associated with a warm Arctic‐cold Eurasian pattern of surface temperature (T2m), a low Arctic‐high Eurasian pattern of sea level pressure (SLP), and a southeastward propagating wave‐train originating from Arctic in the upper troposphere. The ENSO‐forced teleconnection is associated with a poleward propagating wave‐train originating from tropical Pacific in the upper troposphere, a low North Pacific‐high Arctic pattern of SLP, and a cold North Pacific‐warm Greenland pattern of T2m. The metrics of Taylor skill scores and Distance between indices of simulation and observation (DISO) are used to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the performance of models. The results of subjective and objective evaluation are essentially consistent. The CanESM5, MPI‐ESM1‐2‐HR, EC‐Earth3, and MRI‐ESM2‐0 models have the best performance in simulating the Arctic SIC‐forced teleconnection.

The two best‐performing multi‐model ensembles well reproduce the dynamic processes of the Arctic SIC‐ and ENSO‐ forced teleconnection.

All pressures are expected to worsen in the future under business‐as‐usual scenarios (or similar) based on past trajectories and/or models of future scenarios. Eight of the pressures assessed have not been projected into the future (diseases and pathogens, introduced coastal wildlife predation, disruption to sediment dynamics, wildlife strikes, organic and inorganic chemical pollution, light and noise pollution), likely due to the limited availability of data describing current pressures, the challenges of modeling future pressures, and high levels of uncertainty.

To better understand these dynamics, this study leverages historical forest‐based wind damage data in the United States and applies this information as shocks within a global forest sector outlook model. A large, localized wind event modeled as a shock to the US South creates a one‐time increase of 18.7 million m3 from salvage harvest operations, equal to over 4% of national harvest. This crowds out traditional harvest activities, leading to downward pressure on prices in the short run, followed by a persistent effect that could take approximately 25 years to dissipate from markets. Average annual wind damage contributes downward pressure on roundwood prices between 1% and 4% in the United States, and this effect is distributed to other countries. The findings suggest that large, localized shocks reverberate across regions and wood product markets due to their interconnected supply chains and trade patterns, and these impacts have important temporal dynamics. Another key result is that the magnitude of these effects are offset by endogenous market reactions in other markets. In other words, unaffected regions change their harvesting patterns in order to compensate for changes in the availability of fiber, shedding light on the importance of capturing global channels as large shocks materialize in changes in market dynamics internationally. Monte Carlo simulations suggest a wide confidence band on salvage harvest rates and prices."

 The mechanisms underlying the deformation and eventual destruction of Earth’s cratons remain enigmatic, despite proposed links to subduction and deep mantle plume processes. Here we study the deformation of the North China Craton using four-dimensional mantle flow models of the plate–mantle system since the late Mesozoic, integrating constraints from lithospheric deformation, mantle seismic tomography and the evolution of surface topography. We find that flat-slab subduction induced landward shortening and lithospheric thickening, while subsequent flat-slab rollback caused seaward extension and lithospheric thinning. Both subduction phases resulted in substantial topographic changes in basin sediments. Rapid flat-slab rollback, coupled with a viscosity jump and phase change across the 660 km mantle discontinuity, was a key ingredient in shaping a large mantle wedge. We argue that craton deformation through lithospheric extension and thinning was triggered by the subduction of a flat slab and its subsequent rollback. The integration of data into mechanical models provides insights into the four-dimensional dynamic interplay involving subduction, mantle processes, craton deformation and topography.

 Spatiotemporal structured light has opened up new avenues for optics and photonics. Current spatiotemporal manipulation of light mostly relies on phase-only devices such as liquid crystal spatial light modulators to generate spatiotemporal optical fields with unique photonic properties. However, simultaneous manipulation of both amplitude and phase of the complex field for the spatiotemporal light is still lacking, limiting the diversity and richness of achievable photonic properties. In this work, a simple and versatile spatiotemporal holographic method that can arbitrarily sculpt the spatiotemporal light is presented. The capabilities of this simple yet powerful method are demonstrated through the generation of fundamental and higher-order spatiotemporal Bessel wavepackets, spatiotemporal crystal-like and quasi-crystal-like structures, and spatiotemporal flat-top wavepackets. Fully customizable spatiotemporal wavepackets will find broader application in investigating the dynamics of spatiotemporal fields and interactions between ultrafast spatiotemporal pulses and matters, unveiling previously hidden light-matter interactions and unlocking breakthroughs in photonics and beyond.

This study finds that incorporating delayed phenotypic plasticity in mosquito traits significantly enhances the accuracy of dengue risk predictions. 
 The incidence of vector-borne disease is on the rise globally, with burdens increasing in endemic countries and outbreaks occurring in new locations. Effective mitigation and intervention strategies require models that accurately predict both spatial and temporal changes in disease dynamics, but this remains challenging due to the complex and interactive relationships between environmental variation and the vector traits that govern the transmission of vector-borne diseases. Predictions of disease risk in the literature typically assume that vector traits vary instantaneously and independently of population density, and therefore do not capture the delayed response of these same traits to past biotic and abiotic environments. We argue here that to produce accurate predictions of disease risk it is necessary to account for environmentally driven and delayed instances of phenotypic plasticity. To show this, we develop a stage and phenotypically structured model for the invasive mosquito vector, Aedes albopictus, and dengue, the second most prevalent human vector-borne disease worldwide. We find that environmental variation drives a dynamic phenotypic structure in the mosquito population, which accurately predicts global patterns of mosquito trait-abundance dynamics. In turn, this interacts with disease transmission to capture historic dengue outbreaks. By comparing the model to a suite of simpler models, we reveal that it is the delayed phenotypic structure that is critical for accurate prediction. Consequently, the incorporation of vector trait relationships into transmission models is critical to improvement of early warning systems that inform mitigation and control strategies. There is a need for accurate models to predict disease dynamics by considering the interactions between environment and vector traits.

Here the authors show that osmotic swelling enhances ligand-dependent signalling of β2-AR: this suggests regulatory mechanisms for GPCRs via their biophysical context. 
 G protein-coupled receptors’ conformational landscape can be affected by their local, microscopic interactions within the cell plasma membrane. We employ here a pleiotropic stimulus, namely osmotic swelling, to alter the cortical environment within intact cells and monitor the response in terms of receptor function and downstream signaling. We observe that in osmotically swollen cells the β2-adrenergic receptor, a prototypical GPCR, favors an active conformation, resulting in cAMP transient responses to adrenergic stimulation that have increased amplitude. The results are validated in primary cell types such as adult cardiomyocytes, a model system where swelling occurs upon ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our results suggest that receptors’ function is finely modulated by their biophysical context, and specifically that osmotic swelling acts as a potentiator of downstream signaling, not only for the β2-adrenergic receptor, but also for other receptors, hinting at a more general regulatory mechanism. Osmotic swelling alters the local membrane environment, activating several GPCRs.

 Tumour detection with high selectivity and sensitivity is crucial for delineating tumour margins and identifying metastatic foci during image-guided surgery. Optical nanoprobes with preferential tumour accumulation is often limited by inefficient amplification of biological signals. Here, we report the design of a library of hydrophobic core-tunable ultra-pH-sensitive nanoprobes (HUNPs) for orthogonally amplifying tumour microenvironmental signals on multiple tumour models. We find that tuning the hydrophobicity of nanoparticle core composition with non-ionizable monomers can enhance cellular association of HUNPs by more than ten-fold, resulting in a high cellular internalization efficiency of HUNPs with up to 50% in tumours. Combining high tumour accumulation and high cell internalization efficiency, HUNPs show orthogonally amplified fluorescence signals, permitting the precise locating and delineating margins between malignant lesions and normal tissues with high contrast-to-noise ratio and resolution. Our study provides key strategies to design nanomedicines with high intracellular bioavailability for cancer detection, drug/gene delivery, and therapy.

 Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to produce high-value ethylene is often limited by poor selectivity and yield of multi-carbon products. To address this, we propose a cyanamide-coordinated isolated copper framework with both metallic copper (Cu0) and charged copper (Cu1+) sites as an efficient electrocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to ethylene. Our operando electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that copper atoms in the Cuδ+NCN complex enhance carbon dioxide activation by improving surface carbon monoxide adsorption, while delocalized electrons around copper sites facilitate carbon-carbon coupling by reducing the Gibbs free energy for *CHC formation. This leads to high selectivity for ethylene production. The Cuδ+NCN catalyst achieves 77.7% selectivity for carbon dioxide to ethylene conversion at a partial current density of 400 milliamperes per square centimeter and demonstrates long-term stability over 80 hours in membrane electrode assembly-based electrolysers. This study provides a strategic approach for designing catalysts for the electrosynthesis of value-added chemicals from carbon dioxide.

Here, the authors show that reactivated astrocytes secrete clusterin to impede remyelination by blocking astrocytic removal of myelin debris and oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation in mouse models of demyelination. 
 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating demyelinating disease characterized by remyelination failure attributed to inadequate oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) differentiation and aberrant astrogliosis. A comprehensive cell atlas reanalysis of clinical specimens brings to light heightened clusterin (CLU) expression in a specific astrocyte subtype links to active lesions in MS patients. Our investigation reveals elevated astrocytic CLU levels in both active lesions of patient tissues and female murine MS models. CLU administration stimulates primary astrocyte proliferation while concurrently impeding astrocyte-mediated clearance of myelin debris. Intriguingly, CLU overload directly impedes OPC differentiation and induces OPCs and OLs apoptosis. Mechanistically, CLU suppresses PI3K-AKT signaling in primary OPCs via very low-density lipoprotein receptor. Pharmacological activation of AKT rescues the damage inflicted by excess CLU on OPCs and ameliorates demyelination in the corpus callosum. Furthermore, conditional knockout of CLU emerges as a promising intervention, showcasing improved remyelination processes and reduced severity in murine MS models.

Here, the authors use experimentally evolved yeasts to show that, in spite of exploitative non-producers, overproducers are maintained in the population, supporting public goods production. 
 Microbial secretions, such as metabolic enzymes, are often considered to be cooperative public goods as they are costly to produce but can be exploited by others. They create incentives for the evolution of non-producers, which can drive producer and population productivity declines. In response, producers can adjust production levels. Past studies suggest that while producers lower production to reduce costs and exploitation opportunities when under strong selection pressure from non-producers, they overproduce secretions when these pressures are weak. We challenge the universality of this trend with the production of a metabolic enzyme, invertase, by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which catalyses sucrose hydrolysis into two hexose molecules. Contrary to past studies, overproducers evolve during evolutionary experiments even when under strong selection pressure from non-producers. Phenotypic and competition assays with a collection of synthetic strains - engineered to have modified metabolic attributes - identify two mechanisms for suppressing the benefits of invertase to those who exploit it. Invertase overproduction increases extracellular hexose concentrations that suppresses the metabolic efficiency of competitors, due to the rate-efficiency trade-off, and also enhances overproducers’ hexose capture rate by inducing transporter expression. Thus, overproducers are maintained in the environment originally thought to not support public goods production. Microbial secretions can be costly to produce and exploited by others. Here, the authors use experimentally evolved yeasts to show that, in spite of exploitative non-producers, overproducers are maintained in the population, supporting public goods production."

 The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is an important component of the climate system because of its role in the heat transport. Its strength is sensitive to the surface density but mechanisms of the effect of Southern Ocean freshwater anomalies are relatively unknown. Here, we investigate the impact of Antarctic ice sheet meltwater on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation using an earth system model of intermediate complexity. The meltwater over the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean is transported to the east and, after passing the Drake Passage, travels northward reaching the North Atlantic. Furthermore, Southern Ocean cooling induces a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, leading to more precipitation in the tropical Atlantic. Consequently, the reduced salinity weakens the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Additional experiments, in which the duration period of freshwater hosing was varied while keeping its total amount constant, indicate that the amplitude and the duration of the meltwater play crucial roles in determining the degree of reduction in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.

 Low solubility and low reactivity towards organic compounds make phosphorus a problematic element for the origin and early evolution of life. Reduced and polymerized phosphorus species are more bioavailable and may resolve these issues, but widespread formation pathways for these species are not well understood. Here we show, using experiments and thermodynamic modelling, that diverse polyphosphates (straight-chains with up to five and cyclophosphates with three and four phosphate molecules) and reduced phosphite can form under ferruginous anhydrous conditions at 80-700 °C. We find that hydrogen and temperature enhance phosphite production while polyphosphate formation maximizes at moderate temperatures (175-200 °C). Chromite and Nickel-bearing minerals enhance phosphate polymerization and reduction whereas magnetite inhibits them. These findings expand on previous investigations of thermally induced changes in phosphorus-speciation and show that these reactions may be widespread in nature. Metamorphism of ferruginous sediments, serpentinization, as well as subaerial lakes exposed to volcanic heating could potentially produce a wealth of polyphosphates along with phosphite on the early Earth. Later, these species may have participated in prebiotic phosphorylation reactions upon liberation by subsequent fluid infiltration. Our results thus offer a more widespread pathway for the generation of reactive phosphorus for the origin of life.

 Single crystal paleointensity (SCP) reveals that the Moon lacked a long-lived core dynamo, though mysteries remain. An episodic dynamo, seemingly recorded by some Apollo basalts, is temporally and energetically problematic. We evaluate this enigma through study of ~3.7 billion-year-old (Ga) Apollo basalts 70035 and 75035. Whole rock analyses show unrealistically high nominal magnetizations, whereas SCP indicate null fields, illustrating that the former do not record an episodic dynamo.

 Artisanal and small-scale mining is an important livelihood activity in many biodiversity hotspots.

 Satellite altimetry data has become essential for studying the dynamics of water bodies, especially in regions with limited or inaccessible data. Traditional low-resolution mode (LRM) satellites' accuracy cannot be guaranteed when it comes to assessing water levels in small- (< 200 m in width) and medium-sized (200–800 m in width) rivers. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeters, exemplified by Sentinel-3 A, have shown great potential for inland water altimetry. Nevertheless, developing algorithms to retrack the raw data remains an essential requirement in this context. This is attributed to the width of small-sized rivers, which is often narrower than the along-track resolution of both LRM and SAR altimeters. In addition, new altimeters may have long revisit cycles and different spatial coverage and cannot yield historical data necessary in some situations.To address these challenges, this study proposed a conditional threshold retracker (CTR). The CTR algorithm is well-designed and facilitates accurate water level monitoring. Moreover, we proposed an enhanced footprint filter (EFF), thus significantly bolstering the number of available cycles. Our findings demonstrate that the developed method substantially enhances the temporal and spatial resolution of both LRM and SAR altimetry satellites during water level monitoring in rivers of different climate types. The width of the thirteen selected rivers is on the order of 85–630 m. The CTR significantly improved the water level monitoring accuracy by 68 %–78 %. Furthermore, the EFF increased the number of water level cycles by approximately 49 %–68 %.

 The fraction of green vegetation is a widely-used indicator of vegetation abundance at regional and/or global scales. The pixel mixture model, especially the dimidiate pixel model (DPM, also referred to as two-endmember model) based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), plays an important role in the accurate estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) via remote sensing. The two components in the traditional DPM are vegetation and soil (both sunlit and shaded). However, to date, the influence of shaded vegetation and shaded soil has not been fully considered in the NDVI-based DPM. Herein we analyze the necessity and feasibility of processing shaded components separately. The shaded soil was found to largely affect the canopy NDVI and can be combined with the vegetation (both sunlit and shaded) as one of the two components in DPM due to the high NDVI of shaded soil under a small percentage of diffuse sky radiation (< 10 % of the total hemispherical radiation in red band in this study). This finding partially explains why the canopy NDVI is oversensitive to background. The DPM was then improved with the solar and view angles to account for the fraction of shaded soil. We performed simulation and field measurements to validate the proposed models to varying factors including the vegetation structure, soil background, solar and view geometry, and slope gradient. The improved DPMs outperformed the traditional DPM (i.e., where no effect of shaded soil is considered) when estimating the NDVI and FVC of the mixed pixel. The FVC estimated with traditional DPM results in the RMSE from 0.14 to 0.31, and that with the improved DPMs range from 0.04 to 0.13. The decrease of uncertainty by using the improved DPMs was generally over 50 % when compared to the output from a traditional DPM. The proposed DPM maintains the advantage of an easy-of-use two-component mixture model yet is more accurate than traditional ones and thus expected to improve the FVC estimation from satellite data."

 Accurate long-term monitoring of wetlands using satellite archives is crucial for effective conservation. While new methods based on temporal profile classification have been useful for long-term monitoring of wetlands, their advantages over traditional classification methods have not yet been demonstrated. This study aimed to compare continuous change detection (using the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) algorithm) to traditional post-classification change detection for monitoring wetland changes between 1984 and 2022 in a temperate coastal marsh (Marais Poitevin, France) from the Landsat archive. The reference dataset was collected mainly from field observations and used to train and test a random forest classifier. The accuracy of the resulting change map was then assessed for both methods using validation points collected via visual interpretation of historical aerial photographs and Landsat temporal profiles. The change map derived from CCDC had much higher unbiased overall accuracy (0.86 ± 0.02) than that derived from post-classification change detection (0.51 ± 0.03). In addition, wetland loss was much higher than wetland gain (18 % and 2 % of the area, respectively) and was due mainly to conversion of grassland to cropland and urbanization. The study demonstrated that, unlike traditional post-classification change detection, continuous change detection provides maps of wetland changes sufficiently accurate for operational use by managers.

 Rapid and accurate assessment of affected areas is crucial for post-earthquake rescue efforts, as earthquakes can lead to extensive damage and casualties. The post-earthquake damage assessment method based on SAR coherence is widely utilized, but issues such as inadequate consideration of decorrelation factors and underutilization of preseismic coherence can negatively impact assessment outcomes. To address these limitations and enhance accuracy while reducing false alarms, we propose a novel approach for post-earthquake building damage assessment utilizing a SAR coherence time matrix. The proposed method involves constructing time matrices by computing preseismic image coherence to maximize the utilization of preseismic coherence information. By developing a Vision Transformer model within the realm of deep learning, we aimed to extract features from these time matrices based on their unique characteristics. Through the use of predicted values obtained from the trained model to simulate coseismic coherence, a scoring metric was established as a proxy for damage. This novel method was successfully applied to evaluate the damage caused by the 2016 Italy earthquake and the 2023 Turkey earthquake, yielding improved accuracy and reduced false alarm rates. The research findings demonstrate the transferability and reliability of this method, presenting it as an accurate and dependable tool for post-earthquake building damage assessment."

The rate of these “periviable” births to non-Hispanic (NH) Black women exceeds four times that for NH whites. Small male periviable infants remain most likely to die. NH white periviable males weigh more than their NH Black counterparts. We argue that male infants born from twin gestations, in which one fetus died in utero (i.e., the vanishing twin syndrome), contribute to the disparity. We cannot directly test our argument because “vanishing” typically occurs before clinical recognition of pregnancy. We, however, describe and find associations that would emerge in vital statistics were our argument correct. Among male periviable singleton births from 288 monthly conception cohorts (January 1995 through December 2018), we found an average NH white advantage of 30 grams (759 grams versus 729 grams).

Ion transport studies reveal ion conductance characteristics of individual BNNTPs, which show an unusualC1/4scaling with ion concentration and pronounced pH sensitivity. Reversal potential measurements indicate that BNNTPs have strong cation selectivity at neutral pH, attributable to the high negative charge on the channel. BNNTPs also deliver very large power density up to 12 kW/m2in the osmotic gradient transport experiments at neutral pH, surpassing that of other BNNT-based devices by two orders of magnitude under similar conditions.

The o-Quality of sleep spindles correlates weakly with their amplitude, shows marked laminar differences and regional topography across cortical regions, reflects the level of synchrony within and between cortical networks, is strongly modulated by sleep-wake history, reflects the degree of sensory disconnection, and correlates with the strength of coupling between spindles and slow waves. As most spindle events are highly localized and not detectable with conventional low-density recording approaches, o-Quality thus emerges as a valuable metric that allows us to infer the spread and dynamics of spindle activity across the brain and directly links their spatiotemporal dynamics with local and global regulation of brain states, sleep regulation, and function."

While phosphorylation on serine-2/serine-5 of the carboxyl-terminal heptad repeats is well established, threonine-4’s role remains enigmatic. Paradoxically, threonine-4 phosphorylation was only detected after transcription end sites despite functionally implicated in pausing, elongation, termination, and messenger RNA processing. Our investigation revealed that threonine-4 phosphorylation detection was obstructed by flanking serine-5 phosphorylation at the onset of transcription, which can be removed selectively. Subsequent proteomic analyses identified many proteins recruited to transcription via threonine-4 phosphorylation, which previously were attributed to serine-2. Loss of threonine-4 phosphorylation greatly reduces serine-2 phosphorylation, revealing a cross-talk between the two marks. Last, the function analysis of the threonine-4 phosphorylation highlighted its role in alternative 3′-end processing within pro-proliferative genes. Our findings unveil the true genomic location of this evolutionarily conserved phosphorylation mark and prompt a reassessment of functional assignments of the carboxyl-terminal domain."

We conducted synchrotron in situ falling sphere viscometry experiments to examine kimberlite magma with different volatile contents (0 to 5 wt % H2O and 2 to 8 wt % CO2) under high pressure-temperature conditions. The results reveal that the viscosity of volatile-rich kimberlite magma is ~1 to 2 orders lower than that of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) and comparable to the ultramobile pure carbonate melt. Using the measured viscosity values, we simulated the ascent and eruption process of kimberlite magma.

The director field resulting from the boundary conditions is calculated with Landau de Gennes theory and validated by comparing experimentally measured and theoretically predicted birefringence patterns. We demonstrate our procedures for structures of varying complexity and then employed them to fabricate 4D microstructures that show the desired actuation.

The lungs are densely innervated by nociceptor sensory neurons that mediate breathing, cough, and bronchoconstriction.

Ablation of nociceptors in mice increased lung CRKP clearance, suppressed trans-alveolar dissemination of CRKP, and protected mice from hypothermia and death. Furthermore, ablation of nociceptors enhanced the recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6Chimonocytes and cytokine induction. Depletion of Ly6Chimonocytes, but not of neutrophils, abrogated lung and extrapulmonary CRKP clearance in ablated mice, suggesting that Ly6Chimonocytes are a critical cellular population to regulate pneumonic sepsis.

Unexpectedly, the small GTPase Rho, a crucial regulator of cell movement, has been reported to be active in both local cell protrusions and retractions, raising the question of how Rho activity can coordinate cell migration. Here, we show that Rho activity is absent in local protrusions and active during retractions. During retractions, Rho rapidly activated ezrin-radixin-moesin proteins (ERMs) to increase actin-membrane attachment, and, with a delay, nonmuscle myosin 2 (NM2). Rho activity was excitable, with NM2 acting as a slow negative feedback regulator. Strikingly, inhibition of SLK/LOK kinases, through which Rho activates ERMs, caused elongated cell morphologies, impaired Rho-induced cell contractions, and reverted Rho-induced blebbing. Together, our study demonstrates that Rho activity drives retractions by sequentially enhancing ERM-mediated actin-membrane attachment for force transmission and NM2-dependent contractility."

Electrical gating offers a promising route to control and study these effects, as static screening charges reside at the boundary. We investigate the modulation of the surface response upon direct electrical charging of single plasmonic nanoresonators. By analyzing measured changes in light scattering within the framework of surface response functions, we find the resonance shift well accounted for by modulation of the classical in-plane surface current. Unexpectedly, we also observed a change in the resonance width, indicating reduced losses for negatively charged resonators.

While enduring, this framework has limitations: Temporal pairing–based models of learning do not fit with many experimental observations and cannot be used to make quantitative predictions about behavior.

The fibers are actuated via a computer interface, enabling precise control over actuation direction, magnitude, and frequency. Unlike conventional methods, our technique initiates the actuation at the base of the fibers, which is enabled by fabricating the fibers directly onto an electrical circuit. Fiber actuation is achieved by localized addressing of an in situ formed radially aligned segment. This induces reduction in the scalar order parameter and leads to deformation of the fiber base, causing bending toward the activated region. Extensive modeling validates this actuation mechanism and identifies optimal conditions and actuation strategies for achieving the desired responses. The actuation process is rapid, is highly reversible, and maintains excellent performance over repeated (>200) cycles. These liquid crystal fiber arrays provide a safe contact with humans or other objects, making them highly suitable for applications in smart wearable devices and immersive interfaces."

A main application of LCA is to compare alternative products to identify and promote those that are more environmentally friendly. Such comparative LCA studies often rest on, explicitly or implicitly, an idealized assumption, namely, 1:1 displacement between functionally equivalent products. However, product displacement in the real world is much more complicated, affected by various factors such as the rebound effect and policy schemes. Here, we quantitatively review studies that have considered these aspects to evaluate the magnitude and distribution of realistic displacement estimates across several major product categories (biofuels, electricity, electric vehicles, and recycled products). Results show that displacement ratios concentrate around 40–60%,  suggesting considerable overestimation of the benefits of alternative products if the 1:1 displacement assumption was used. Overall, there have been a small number of modeling studies on realistic product displacement and their scopes were limited. Additional research is needed to cover more product categories and geographies and improve  the modeling of market and policy complexities. As such research accumulates, their displacement estimates can form a database that can be drawn upon by comparative LCA studies to more accurately determine the environmental impacts of alternative products."

A horizontal viscosity scheme restricted to only act on horizontally rotational modes (such as eddies) is introduced and tested. At lower resolutions with horizontal grid spacings of 2 km, the modeled IW dissipation from numerical model agrees reasonably well with observations in some cases when the restricted form of horizontal viscosity is used. This suggests the possibility that if restricted forms of horizontal viscosity are adopted by global models with similar resolutions, they could be used to diagnose and map IW dissipation distributions. At higher resolutions with horizontal grid spacings of ∼250 m, the dissipation from vertical shear and horizontal viscosity act much more strongly resulting in dissipation overestimates; however, the vertical‐shear dissipation itself is found to agree well with observations."

Here we explore the three‐dimensional (spatial and temporal) characteristics and movements of LSExPs and their direct drivers (vertical velocity, water vapor and moisture advection) under six synoptic‐scale circulation patterns in southeastern China. LSExPs are classified as low‐pressure or non‐low types based on circulation anomaly patterns. The low‐pressure LSExPs are associated with anomalous cyclonic low‐pressure systems in the mid‐ and lower‐troposphere, occurring with main coastal precipitation, while the non‐low LSExPs mainly result from cold‐warm air convergence and primarily affect inland areas. Low‐pressure LSExPs exhibit relatively high intensity compared to non‐low types, particularly on days featuring a south‐low and north‐high dipole pattern, which tend to produce more localized and intense precipitation events. Non‐low LSExPs show larger precipitation areas, longer durations, and greater movement distances, and thus impact wider regions, compared to low‐pressure LSExPs. Single high‐pressure or low‐pressure systems are less likely to result in LSExPs, and LSExPs are less severe if occur, compared to other types. All LSExP types move in a direction similar to that of moisture transport, strongly influenced by extreme upward motion of moisture. Low‐pressure LSExPs are more related to the upward motion of the atmosphere at 850 hPa, and they also involve extreme water vapor and moisture transport."

However, the impact of ocean feedbacks on this interaction has not been fully examined. To study it, positive STPs were applied in three otherwise identical, idealized model configurations –atmosphere‐only (A), atmosphere + slab‐ocean (AS), and fully‐coupled atmosphere‐ocean (AO)–and the resulting atmospheric changes compared. In the AO model, changes in the tropics (extratropics) experienced a poleward‐expansion (shift) and positive (negative) feedback after ∼100–200 years, whilst the AS model showed atmospheric and sea surface temperature changes that did not resemble those seen in the AO model. In the AO model, changes in tropical ocean heat content were responsible for the atmospheric changes, attributable to changes in the Ekman transport. These results indicate that full atmosphere‐ocean coupling should be accounted for when studying the long‐term (100+ years) tropospheric response to STPs in the Southern Hemisphere. Validation with higher‐resolution and more realistic models is necessary."

Gabrielle was an ex‐tropical cyclone that stalled and re‐energised off the north coast, resembling descriptions of worst case scenarios for the northeast of the country. Here we report on a comparison of the actual forecast of the storm against forecasts under conditions representative of a climate without anthropogenic interference and of a climate +2.0°C warmer than pre‐industrial (about 1.0°C cooler and warmer than present respectively). We find that regional total rainfall accumulations from a Gabrielle‐like storm are about 10% higher because of the historical anthropogenic warming, and will increase by a larger amount under similar future warming. These differences are driven by a 20% (relative to a non‐anthropogenic world) to 30% (relative to a +2.0°C world) rise in peak rainfall rates, which in turn is mainly driven by a more temporally concentrated column‐integrated moisture flux. The forecast model generates the larger increase for the +2.0°C world through greater precipitation efficiency, reflecting the importance of unresolved precipitation processes in the climate change response of rainfall extremes."

Models consistently suggest substantial disruptions for WAM, ISM, and EASM with shorter wet and longer dry seasons (−29.07%, −18.76%, and −3.78% ensemble mean annual rainfall change, respectively). Models also agree on changes for the SAM, suggesting rainfall increases overall, in contrast to previous studies.

 The carbon sequestration potential of open-ocean pelagic ecosystems is vastly under-reported compared to coastal vegetation ‘blue carbon’ systems. Here we show that just a single pelagic harvested species, Antarctic krill, sequesters a similar amount of carbon through its sinking faecal pellets as marshes, mangroves and seagrass. Due to their massive population biomass, fast-sinking faecal pellets and the modest depths that pellets need to reach to achieve sequestration (mean is 381 m), Antarctic krill faecal pellets sequester 20 MtC per productive season (spring to early Autumn). This is equates USD$ 4 − 46 billion depending on the price of carbon, with krill pellet carbon stored for at least 100 years and with some reaching as far as the North Pacific. Antarctic krill are being impacted by rapid polar climate change and an expanding fishery, thus krill populations and their habitat warrant protection to preserve this valuable carbon sink.

Experimental results on four downstream tasks show that ESM-DBP provides a better feature representation of DNA-binding protein compared to the original language model, resulting in improved prediction performance and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ESM-DBP can still perform well even for those sequences with only a few homologous sequences. ChIP-seq on two predicted cases further support the validity of the proposed method.

 Effectively controlling the selective conversion of CO2 photoreduction to C2 products presents a significant challenge. Here, we develop a heterojunction photocatalyst by controllably implanting Au nanoparticles and single atoms into unsaturated Mo atoms of edge-rich MoS2, denoted as Aun/Au1-CMS. Photoreduction of CO2 results in the production of CH3COOH with a selectivity of 86.4%, which represents a 6.4-fold increase compared to samples lacking single atoms, and the overall selectivity for C2 products is 95.1%. Furthermore, the yield of CH3COOH is 22.4 times higher compared to samples containing single atoms and without nanoparticles. Optical experiments demonstrate that the single atoms domains can effectively capture photoexcited electrons by the Au nanoparticles, or the local electric field generated by the nanoparticles promotes the transfer of photogenerated electrons in MoS2 to Au single atoms, prolonging the relaxation time of photogenerated electrons. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the orbital coupling of Au5d and Mo4d strengthens the oxygen affinity of Mo and carbon affinity of Au. The hybridized orbitals reduce energy splitting levels of CO molecular orbitals, aiding C–C coupling. Moreover, the Mo−Au dual-site stabilize the crucial oxygen-associated intermediate *CH2CO, thereby enhancing the selectivity towards CH3COOH.

 Water structures at electrolyte/electrode interfaces play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and kinetics of electrochemical reactions. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, atomic-level details of ion-specific water structures on metal surfaces remain unclear. Here we show, using scanning tunneling microscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy, that we can visualize water layers containing alkali metal cations on a charged Au(111) surface with atomic resolution. Our results reveal that Li+ cations are elevated from the surface, facilitating the formation of an ice-like water layer between the Li+ cations and the surface. In contrast, K+ and Cs+ cations are in direct contact with the surface. We observe that the water network structure transitions from a hexagonal arrangement with Li+ to a distorted hydrogen-bonding configuration with Cs+. These observations are consistent with surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy data and suggest that alkali metal cations significantly impact hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics and efficiency. Our findings provide insights into ion-specific water structures on metal surfaces and underscore the critical role of spectator ions in electrochemical processes.

 Carbon-based metal-free catalysts are promising green catalysts for photocatalysis and electrocatalysis due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. A key challenge in utilizing these catalysts is identifying their active sites, given their poor crystallinity and complex structures. Here we demonstrate the key structure of the double-bonded conjugated carbon group as a metal-free active site, enabling efficient O2 photoreduction to H2O2 through a cascaded water oxidation − O2 reduction process. Using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as a precursor, we synthesized various carbon-based photocatalysts and analyzed their structural evolution. Under the polymerization conditions of 260 °C to 400 °C, an N-ethyl-2-piperazinone-like structure was formed on the surface of the catalyst, resulting in high photocatalytic H2O2 photoproduction (2884.7 μmol g−1h−1) under visible light.

 The East/Japan Sea (EJS), a marginal sea of the Northwestern Pacific, is one of the ocean regions showing the most rapid warming and greatest increases in ocean heatwaves over the last several decades. Predictability and skillful prediction of the summer season EJS variability are crucial, given the increasing severity of ocean temperature events impacting fisheries and reinforcing climate conditions like the East Asian rainy season, which in turn affects adjacent high-population density areas over East Asia. We use observations and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research (SPEAR) seasonal forecast system to investigate the summertime EJS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) predictability and prediction skill. The observations and seasonal prediction system show that the summer season EJS SST can be closely linked to the previous winter air-sea coupling and predictable 8–9 months in advance. The SPEAR seasonal prediction system demonstrates skillful forecast of EJS SST events from summer to late fall, with added skill for long-lead forecasts initialized in winter. We find that winter large-scale atmospheric circulations linked to Barents Sea variability can induce persistent surface wind anomalies and corresponding northward Ekman heat transport over the East China Sea. The ocean advection anomalies that enter the EJS in prior seasons appear to play a role in developing anomalous SST during summer, along with instantaneous atmospheric forcing, as the source of long-lead predictability. Our findings provide potential applications of large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions in understanding and predicting seasonal variability of East Asian marginal seas."

 With the rapid development of LiDAR and artificial intelligence technologies, 3D point cloud semantic segmentation has become a highlight research topic. This technology is able to significantly enhance the capabilities of building information modeling, navigation and environmental perception. However, current deep learning-based methods primarily rely on voxelization or multi-layer convolution for feature extraction. These methods often face challenges in effectively differentiating between homogeneous objects or structurally adherent targets in complex real-world scenes. To this end, we propose a Graph Transformer point cloud semantic segmentation network (ASGFormer) tailored for structurally adherent objects. Firstly, ASGFormer combines Graph and Transformer to promote global correlation understanding in the graph. Secondly, spatial index and position embedding are constructed based on distance relationships and feature differences. Through a learnable mechanism, the structural weights between points are dynamically adjusted, achieving adaptive spatial structure within the graph. Finally, dummy nodes are introduced to facilitate global information storage and transmission between layers, effectively addressing the issue of information loss at the terminal nodes of the graph. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the various real-world 3D point cloud datasets, analyzing the effectiveness of proposed ASGFormer through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. ASGFormer outperforms existing approaches with of 91.3% for OA, 78.0% for mAcc, and 72.3% for mIoU on S3DIS dataset.

 Deep neural networks (DNNs) have risen to prominence as key solutions in numerous AI applications for earth observation (AI4EO). However, their susceptibility to adversarial examples poses a critical challenge, compromising the reliability of AI4EO algorithms. This paper presents a novel Universal Adversarial Defense approach in Remote Sensing Imagery (UAD-RS), leveraging pre-trained diffusion models to protect DNNs against various adversarial examples exhibiting heterogeneous adversarial patterns. Specifically, a universal adversarial purification framework is developed utilizing pre-trained diffusion models to mitigate adversarial perturbations through the introduction of Gaussian noise and subsequent purification of the perturbations from adversarial examples. Additionally, an Adaptive Noise Level Selection (ANLS) mechanism is introduced to determine the optimal noise level for the purification framework with a task-guided Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) ranking strategy, thereby enhancing purification performance. Consequently, only a single pre-trained diffusion model is required for purifying various adversarial examples with heterogeneous adversarial patterns across each dataset, significantly reducing training efforts for multiple attack settings while maintaining high performance without prior knowledge of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results on four heterogeneous RS datasets, focusing on scene classification and semantic segmentation, demonstrate that UAD-RS outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial purification approaches, providing universal defense against seven commonly encountered adversarial perturbations. Codes and the pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/EricYu97/UAD-RS)."

But internal variability strongly modulates the variability of temperature at mid- and- high latitudes, for example, causing the remarkable cooling and severe winter weather over Eurasia from the 1990s to the early 2010s. It remains unclear whether the occurrence of Eurasian cooling and cold extremes will be offset by climate warming or stimulated by internal variability in the future. Based on the Sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project multi-model projections for 2015–2100, this study shows that the projected probability of Eurasian cooling trend decreases with increasing greenhouse gas concentration in the long-term (i.e. 2070–2099) from 14.8% under SSP126 to 0.9% under SSP585. In the near-term (i.e. 2021–2050), however, Eurasian cooling occurrences are less influenced by different emission scenarios. Coinciding with deep Arctic warming throughout the troposphere, the projected significant Eurasian cooling exhibits similar pattern and intensity among different scenarios. The similar trend towards tropospheric anticyclone over the Arctic among different scenarios in the near-term promotes the deep Arctic warming-Eurasian cooling trend through transporting warm (cold) air into the Arctic (mid-latitudes). Moreover, winter extreme cold anomalies (i.e. −3.0–−2.0 °C) and extreme cold days (i.e. 4–6 d) over the Eurasian continent are not sensitive to emission scenarios in the near-term. In the long-term, the accelerating climate warming under high-emission scenarios significantly reduces the frequency and intensity of Eurasian cold extremes compared to low-emission scenarios. Therefore, the occurrence of Eurasian cooling trend and cold extremes in the near-term will be dominated by internal influences (e.g. Ural blocking) and will rely more on the internal variability after the mid-century if carbon neutrality goal is achieved."

Modeling results reveal that laterally variable low‐viscosity zones (1017∼1018 Pa·s) beneath the Coso Volcanic Field are required to explain the observations well. These low‐viscosity materials may reduce the width of the brittle part of the fault, thus affecting the northwestward propagation of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake rupture and the spatial pattern of nearby seismicity. Numerical simulations reveal that the postseismic viscoelastic relaxation of the event will cause contractional strain in the upper‐crustal magma reservoirs, which may counteract the extensional strain caused by the coseismic rupture."

Using the derived elastic parameters, we establish the velocity and density profiles of subducted sediments in the upper mantle.

Meanwhile, continuous heating will lead to the dehydration of phengite in sediments. The dehydration of this amount sediments can generate a 3%–6% ISS with negative Clapeyron slopes, satisfying the observed L‐discontinuity in northern Finland and northern America without the anisotropy changes but accompanied by low‐velocity anomalies.

The Rat1-Rai1-Rtt103 structure revealed that Rat1 and Rai1 form a heterotetramer with a single Rtt103 bound between two Rai1 molecules. In the type-1 complex, Rat1-Rai1 forms a heterodimer and binds to the RNA exit site of RNAPII to extract RNA into the Rat1 exonuclease active site. This interaction changes the RNA path in favor of termination (the “pre-termination” state). The type-1b and type-2 complexes have no bound DNA/RNA, likely representing the “post-termination” states.

 Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the mitochondrial inner membrane is a therapeutic target in many diseases. Neural stem cells (NSCs) show progress in improving mitochondrial dysfunction in the central nervous system (CNS). However, translating neural stem cell-based therapies to the clinic is challenged by uncontrollable biological variability or heterogeneity, hindering uniform clinical safety and efficacy evaluations. We propose a systematic top-down design based on membrane self-assembly to develop neural stem cell-derived oxidative phosphorylating artificial organelles (SAOs) for targeting the central nervous system as an alternative to NSCs. We construct human conditionally immortal clone neural stem cells (iNSCs) as parent cells and use a streamlined closed operation system to prepare neural stem cell-derived highly homogenous oxidative phosphorylating artificial organelles. These artificial organelles act as biomimetic organelles to mimic respiration chain function and perform oxidative phosphorylation, thus improving ATP synthesis deficiency and rectifying excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Conclusively, we provide a framework for a generalizable manufacturing procedure that opens promising prospects for disease treatment.

 Metal hydrides are crucial intermediates in numerous catalytic reactions. Intensive efforts have been dedicated to constructing molecular metal hydrides, where toxic precursors and delicate mediators are usually involved. Herein, we demonstrate a facile pressure-induced methodology to generate a cost-effective heterogeneous electrocatalytic metal hydride surface for sustainable hydrogen transfer.

Specifically, the maximal Faradaic efficiency for formate is enhanced by ~fivefold to 83% under ambient conditions. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that unlike the distal hydrogenation route for CO2 to CO over pristine Zn, the Zn hydride surface enables direct hydrogenation at the carbon site of CO2 to form formate.

Here, the authors use multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to map and quantify the composition of affected muscle tissue to determine disease severity and potentially monitor future therapies. 
 Pompe disease (PD) is a rare autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder that causes proximal muscle weakness and loss of respiratory function. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only effective treatment, biomarkers for disease monitoring are scarce. Following ex vivo biomarker validation in phantom studies, we apply multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), a laser- and ultrasound-based non-invasive imaging approach, in a clinical trial (NCT05083806) to image the biceps muscles of 10 late-onset PD (LOPD) patients and 10 matched healthy controls. MSOT is compared with muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, spirometry, muscle testing and quality of life scores. Next, results are validated in an independent LOPD patient cohort from a second clinical site. Our study demonstrates that MSOT enables imaging of subcellular disease pathology with increases in glycogen/water, collagen and lipid signals, providing higher sensitivity in detecting muscle degeneration than current methods. This translational approach suggests implementation in the complex care of these rare disease patients. Pompe disease (PD) is a rare disorder that leads to progressive muscle weakness if left untreated. Here, the authors use multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to map and quantify the composition of affected muscle tissue to determine disease severity and potentially monitor future therapies."

This work investigates the effects of charging protocols and electrode structures on electrochemical CO2 capture and explores the potential of devices for practical CO2 capture, especially in the presence of O2. 
 Supercapacitors are emerging as energy-efficient and robust devices for electrochemical CO2 capture. However, the impacts of electrode structure and charging protocols on CO2 capture performance remain unclear. Therefore, this study develops structure-property-performance correlations for supercapacitor electrodes at different charging conditions. We find that electrodes with large surface areas and low oxygen functionalization generally perform best, while a combination of micro- and mesopores is important to achieve fast CO2 capture rates. With these structural features and tunable charging protocols, YP80F activated carbon electrodes show the best CO2 capture performance with a capture rate of 350 mmolCO2 kg–1 h–1 and a low electrical energy consumption of 18 kJ molCO2–1 at 300 mA g–1 under CO2, together with a long lifetime over 12000 cycles at 150 mA g–1 under CO2 and excellent CO2 selectivity over N2 and O2. Operated in a “positive charging mode”, the system achieves excellent electrochemical reversibility with Coulombic efficiencies over 99.8% in the presence of approximately 15% O2, alongside stable cycling performance over 1000 cycles. This study paves the way for improved supercapacitor electrodes and charging protocols for electrochemical CO2 capture. Supercapacitors are emerging as energy-efficient devices for CO2 capture.

 The complex jagged trajectory of fractured surfaces of two pieces of forensic evidence is used to recognize a “match” by using comparative microscopy and tactile pattern analysis. The material intrinsic properties and microstructures, as well as the exposure history of external forces on a fragment of forensic evidence have the premise of uniqueness at a relevant microscopic length scale (about 2–3 grains for cleavage fracture), wherein the statistics of the fracture surface become non-self-affine. We utilize these unique features to quantitatively describe the microscopic aspects of fracture surfaces for forensic comparisons, employing spectral analysis of the topography mapped by three-dimensional microscopy. Multivariate statistical learning tools are used to classify articles and result in near-perfect identification of a “match” and “non-match” among candidate forensic specimens. The framework has the potential for forensic application across a broad range of fractured materials and toolmarks, of diverse texture and mechanical properties.

 Immune memory has been expanded to group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), but the cellular and molecular bases remain incompletely understood. Based on house dust mite (HDM)-induced mice asthma models and human samples, we applied flow cytometry, parabiosis, in vivo imaging and adoptive transplantation to confirm the persistence, migration and function of CD45+lineage–CD90.2+NK1.1–NKp46–ST2–KLRG1+IL-17RB+ memory-like ILC2s (ml-ILC2s). Regulated by CCR9/CCL25 and S1P signaling, ml-ILC2s reside in the lamina propria of small intestines (siLP) in asthma remission, and subsequently move to airway upon re-encountering antigens or alarmins. Furthermore, ml-ILC2s possess properties of longevity, potential of rapid proliferation and producing IL-13, and display transcriptional characteristics with up-regulation of Tox and Tcf-7. ml-ILC2s transplantation restore the asthmatic changes abrogated by Tox and Tcf7 knockdown.

 In eukaryotes, the leading strand DNA is synthesized by Polε and the lagging strand by Polδ. These replicative polymerases have higher processivity when paired with the DNA clamp PCNA. While the structure of the yeast Polε catalytic domain has been determined, how Polε interacts with PCNA is unknown in any eukaryote, human or yeast. Here we report two cryo-EM structures of human Polε–PCNA–DNA complex, one in an incoming nucleotide bound state and the other in a nucleotide exchange state. The structures reveal an unexpected three-point interface between the Polε catalytic domain and PCNA, with the conserved PIP (PCNA interacting peptide)-motif, the unique P-domain, and the thumb domain each interacting with a different protomer of the PCNA trimer. We propose that the multi-point interface prevents other PIP-containing factors from recruiting to PCNA while PCNA functions with Polε.

 The mid-Holocene climate optimum saw warm temperatures in large parts of China, but its impact on seasonal environmental changes is not fully understood yet. Here, we use high-resolution geochemical analyses of 7000 to 6000 year-old oyster shells from the Yangtze River Delta to reconstruct climatic and oceanographic patterns. The stable isotope (δ18O, δ13C) and clumped isotope data reflect prominent seasonal changes in temperature, precipitation, and river discharge. Summer months experienced warm temperatures and a distinct increase in rainfalls and river discharge. In contrast, winter months were characterized by a dry season, which might have been longer than today. Stable isotope data also indicate regular summer upwelling in the study area. These results partly disagree with available climate models raising doubts on the models’ reliability. Thus, our palaeo-proxy data offers the possibility to evaluate and correct climate models and thereby improve predictions for the future considering on-going global warming.

 Accurate nearshore bathymetry estimation remains a critical challenge, impacting coastal forecasting evolution assessments through the inaccuracies in both in-situ and remote sensing surveys. This article introduces the Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) temporal correlation method, showcasing its ability in deriving accurate nearshore bathymetry from one minute spaceborne videos. The approach utilises correlation of pixel intensity time series, shifted in time and space, extracted from a frame stack within a defined correlation window. The resulting correlation is then projected using the Radon Transform to infer wave characteristics (celerity and wavelength) for the estimation of depth through wave linear dispersion. Moreover, the adaptation of the correlation window based on a first wavelength estimation provided a more focused assessment of the wavefield that reveals morphological features such as sandbars in the bathymetric estimation. The method’s capabilities using adapted correlation window is illustrated through its application to a metric resolution Jilin satellite video (57 s at 5 Hz) along the Saint-Louis coast in Senegal. Through this demonstration, the temporal correlation method is among the first SDB methods to successfully capture the submerged sandbar along a beach. Comparison against in-situ measurements conducted three years prior to the video acquisition shows a good agreement with a bias of 0.97 m within the initial 2 km of the cross-shore profile. Furthermore, the application of previously developed sky-glint surface elevation analysis on video pixel intensity, prior to the bathymetry estimation, significantly reduces the bias to 0.44 m in the Saint-Louis estimation. This article highlights the potential applications of future Earth observation satellite missions that will capture image sequences (or videos) such as CO3D (CNES/Airbus)."

 The vegetation dynamics in highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g., riparian vegetation surrounding waterholes and oases) are difficult to detect from large (e.g., MODIS) and moderate (e.g., Landsat) spatial resolution remote sensing products. Within a “classify-to-monitor” approach, a method to monitor spatially heterogeneous riparian vegetation dynamics is developed by integrating high spatial resolution discrete return airborne LiDAR data (1 m pixels) with moderate resolution Landsat fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (fPAR) data (30 m). LiDAR was used to identify and classify vegetation surrounding permanent waterholes within the Cooper Creek floodplain, in dryland Australia. These waterholes are important areas for ecological conservation given their highly spatially heterogeneous vegetation structure. Landsat fPAR was temporally decomposed into persistent and recurrent components and then integrated with the LiDAR-derived vegetation classes. The LiDAR data were used as a mask to separate the fPAR signal of each vegetation class, capturing their specific dynamics and which fPAR component they are associated with. The newly developed method provides the means to improve the interpretation of Landsat fPAR by monitoring distinct vegetation functional groups within each Landsat pixel. Results showed that LiDAR data provided good estimates of vegetation cover compared to field measurements (R2=0.952). LiDAR data identified different vegetation structural classes within the riparian zone. The integration of LiDAR and Landsat data permitted the distinction of temporal patterns of each vegetation structural class, uncovering the specific temporal and spatial variability of fPAR that would otherwise be undetected. Landsat fPAR provided information on which vegetation component contributed to the fPAR variability in each class, thus providing the means for enhanced ecological interpretation of the temporally decomposed fPAR components. The method can be applied to other similar highly spatially heterogeneous ecosystems to monitor structurally specific vegetation dynamics more accurately than if only using moderate spatial resolution time-series optical satellite imagery."

 Salt marshes are pivotal in the global carbon cycle, serving as significant contributors to the blue carbon sink. Accurately estimating carbon stock in salt marshes relies on precise vegetation classification. Here, we developed the Salt Marsh Vegetation Classification Network (SVCN), a deep learning algorithm designed to classify three primary vegetation canopies (S. alterniflora, P. australis, and S. mariqueter) spanning from 2016 to 2023 over the Yangtze River estuary, China. The SVCN was initially trained using 412 vegetation samples and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in 2018. Additionally, we trained three traditional machine learning models – Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors – to facilitate a comparative analysis of model performance. Leveraging the classified vegetation outcomes, we conducted salt marsh carbon stock estimations using the InVEST model. The results showed that the SVCN model outperformed the other three models, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.97. Salt marsh carbon stocks in the Yangtze River estuary exhibited an overall increasing trend from 2016 to 2023, with an average annual increase of 3.13 ×103Mg⋅year−1.

Public perception of economic vs. generational inequalities in climate change mitigation policies,"Climate change and most climate policies affect and reinforce different forms of inequalities. For instance, climate change policies that aim to change consumer behavior by increasing the price tag of goods and services that cause carbon emissions often carry a disproportionately higher burden (in terms of financial cost) to those with lower incomes. They can thereby either exacerbate existing income inequalities or contribute to generating new ones. Meanwhile, refraining from engaging with climate mitigation policies will incur other detrimental societal costs: the financial burden and the harmful consequences of climate change that future generations will have to bear if nothing is done. In this paper, we examine how the immediate economic inequality citizens face from climate mitigation policies (regarding carbon taxation) weighs against the long-term generational inequalities future generations will experience. We study how both types of inequality relate to policy support for climate change mitigation policies in the context of Germany. The German case is of special interest because a recent court ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court allows us to test whether making people aware of a new legal reality can bridge the gap between the economic and generational inequality. Our findings using a between-subjects survey experiment fielded among German citizens (N = 6,319) in 2022 show that immediate economic concerns trump future generational concerns, generally making citizens less supportive of the policy. This negative support is however somewhat mitigated by the supportive signal from the court ruling."

Understanding their influence can provide seasonal predictability of agricultural production metrics to inform decision-making and mitigate potential food security challenges. Here, we analyze the effects of ENSO and IOD on four agricultural production metrics (production, harvested area, irrigated area, and yields) for rice, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, and finger millet across India from 1968 to 2015. El Niños and positive-IODs are associated with simultaneous reductions in the production and yields of multiple crops. Impacts vary considerably by crop and geography. Maize and pearl millet experience large declines in both production and yields when compared to other grains in districts located in the northwest and southern peninsular regions. Associated with warmer and drier conditions during El Niño, >70% of all crop districts experience lower production and yields. Impacts of positive-IODs exhibit relatively more spatial variability. La Niña and negative-IODs are associated with simultaneous increases in all production metrics across the crops, particularly benefiting traditional grains. Variations in impacts of ENSO and IOD on different cereals depend on where they are grown and differences in their sensitivity to climate conditions. We compare production metrics for each crop relative to rice in overlapping rainfed districts to isolate the influence of climate conditions. Maize production and yields experience larger reductions relative to rice, while pearl millet production and yields also experience reductions relative to rice during El Niños and positive-IODs. However, sorghum experiences enhanced production and harvested areas, and finger millet experiences enhanced production and yields. These findings suggest that transitioning from maize and rice to these traditional cereals could lower interannual production variability associated with natural climate variations."

We observed a significant correlation between the differences in remote sensing-based estimates of gross primary production (GPP) (ΔGPPMODIS) and the differences in eddy covariance (EC) tower-based GPP (ΔGPPEC) at both high-elevation and low-elevation sites.

Furthermore, there was a significant correlation in the total dissolved stoichiometry of the C/N ratio between imports from and exports to adjacent aquatic systems. These findings highlight the importance of integrating ecological stoichiometric principles to improve our understanding of the complex relationships among physical, chemical, and ecological processes, particularly within the context of the meta-ecosystem framework.

In this paper, we review a large set of scenarios (n = 96) from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE) describing future development of land use, greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on CC and biodiversity. We calculate the global mean temperature increase (GMTI) and the Mean Species Abundance (MSA) of plants, a metric indicative of local terrestrial biodiversity intactness. The set includes scenarios with and without specific CP to address CC, PA for biodiversity and demand and supply sustainability measures such as increased energy efficiency and reduced meat consumption. Our findings indicate that scenarios with integrated measures can prevent biodiversity loss at the global scale, yet with clear regional differences.

We demonstrate that pasture and food/feed crops are the main drivers of MSA loss in Grass & TnF and that scenarios with high levels of PAs prevent land conversion and increase biodiversity. By 2100, 28 out of 46 (60%) scenarios with mitigation measures to restrict CC to 2 °C or less in 2100 result in positive MSA changes in TF, but only 13 (28%) do so in Grass & TnF, reflecting the larger impacts of land use change in the latter region.

High water pressure correlates with better economic performance in the US, while high-energy-pressure cities had GDP per capita about 50% and 70% of the class with highest GDP per capita in China and the US, respectively, suggesting stronger economic constraints from energy stress. Urban agglomeration analysis revealed a negative relationship between WEN and economic performance.

Because the response of the ocean–atmosphere system to mCDR takes years to centuries, modeling is required to assess the impact of mCDR on atmospheric CO2 reduction. Here, we use a coupled ocean–atmosphere model to quantify the atmospheric CO2 reduction in response to a CDR perturbation. We define two metrics to characterize the atmospheric CO2 response to both instantaneous ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) and direct air capture (DAC): the cumulative additionality (α) measures the reduction in atmospheric CO2 relative to the magnitude of the CDR perturbation, while the relative efficiency (ϵ) quantifies the cumulative additionality of mCDR relative to that of DAC. For DAC, α is 100% immediately following CDR deployment, but declines to roughly 50% by 100 years post-deployment as the ocean degasses CO2 in response to the removal of carbon from the atmosphere. For instantaneous OAE, α is zero initially and reaches a maximum of 40%–90% several years to decades later, depending on regional CO2 equilibration rates and ocean circulation processes. The global mean ϵ approaches 100% after 40 years, showing that instantaneous OAE is nearly as effective as DAC after several decades. However, there are significant geographic variations, with ϵ approaching 100% most rapidly in the low latitudes while ϵ stays well under 100% for decades to centuries near deep and intermediate water formation sites. These metrics provide a quantitative framework for evaluating sequestration timescales and carbon market valuation that can be applied to any mCDR strategy."

Quantifying the specific ecological impacts of permafrost thaw remains elusive, as ecological variations are also influenced by external climate factors. This study tackles this gap by employing the Noah-MP model to simultaneously simulate permafrost thermal–hydrological dynamics and net primary production (NPP) across the Three River Headwaters Region from 1989 to 2018. Model results were validated against observations. To isolate the ecological effects of permafrost thaw, we implemented a novel relative time transformation on the simulation results. Our analysis reveals a 7.5 × 104 km2 reduction in permafrost coverage during the study period, coinciding with a 1.09 g C m−2 yr−2 increase in NPP. While precipitation is the primary driver of NPP changes in most years, soil moisture emerges as a crucial factor during permafrost disappearance, when the ground transitions to seasonally frozen ground. Surprisingly, the NPP response to permafrost disappearance exhibited a transient effect, diminishing to negligible levels within five years post-thaw. These findings enhance our understanding of the intricate and dynamic responses of the QTP ecosystem to permafrost degradation under a warming climate."

Local communities on these islands organize beach clean-ups regularly to tackle this problem and, because their waste systems cannot handle the enormous amounts of plastic, predominantly incinerate the collected waste. However, as long as plastic waste keeps entering the ocean, beach clean-ups alone cannot be sustained. The first crucial step to solving this problem is to determine the main sources of plastic waste to the islands. In this study, we simulate the transport of floating plastic waste to determine the main riverine sources of plastic reaching the islands. We find that the majority of simulated plastic waste comes from just 4 Indonesian rivers: the Solo, Brantas, Ci Tanduy, and Wai Sekampung. We suggest that further numerical and field studies, as well as potential river clean-up efforts focus on these rivers to stop plastic waste inundating Christmas Island and the Cocos Keeling Islands."

However, more attention is needed, particularly regarding the content and concentration of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), especially in the context of climate change (CC) impacts. To address this, various controlled field experiments were conducted, involving the cultivation of three wheat cultivars over three growing seasons at multiple locations with different soil and climate conditions under varying Fe and Zn treatments. The yield and yield attributes, including nutritional values such as nitrogen (N), Fe and Zn, from these experiments were integrated with national yield statistics from other locations to train and test different machine learning (ML) algorithms. Automated ML leveraging a large number of models, outperformed traditional ML models, enabling the training and testing of numerous models, and achieving robust predictions of grain yield (GY) (R2 > 0.78), N (R2 > 0.75), Fe (R2 > 0.71) and Zn (R2 > 0.71) through a stacked ensemble of all models. The ensemble model predicted GY, N, Fe, and Zn at spatial explicit in the mid-century (2020–2050) using three Global Circulation Models (GCMs): GFDL-ESM4, HadGEM3-GC31-MM, and MRI-ESM2-0 under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) specifically SSP2-45 and SSP5-85, from the downscaled NEX-GDDP-CMIP6. Averaged across different GCMs and SSPs, CC is projected to increase wheat yield by 4.5%, and protein concentration by 0.8% with high variability.

We propose a combined framework of panel regression model and multi-objective optimization model to identify the key digital sectors and obtain their optimal total outputs. First, the results show that digital inputs continue to increase in most countries (regions) from 2000 to 2021, especially in the USA, EU countries and China. Digital equipment inputs in China are the most significant, while digital service inputs in the USA and EU countries are relatively important. Second, the regression results show that digital service inputs have significantly negative influence on carbon emissions, which means that the growth of digital service inputs will decrease carbon emissions. This result indicates that the key point of industrial digitalization for carbon emission reduction may be increasing the digital service inputs. Third, the optimization results show that the digital-input-oriented optimization model, which encourages an increase in digital service inputs, could achieve greater targets of economic growth and carbon emission reduction.

Approximately 90% of sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) agriculture is rainfed under smallholder farmers who constitute about 60% of the continent’s population and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. While AWM is central to the African agenda, knowledge of AWM is fragmented, making it challenging to operationalize regional initiatives at country levels. Therefore, this study sought to review the status of AWM practices and technologies in Africa and provide guidelines, scenarios, and investment plans to guide the prioritization and operationalization of the African Union’s irrigation development and AWM (AU-IDAWM) initiative. The initiative proposes four developmental pathways; 1—improved water control and watershed management in rain-fed farming, 2—farmer-led irrigation, 3—irrigation scheme development and modernization, and 4—unconventional water use for irrigation. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses approach guided the systematic literature review. The study indicates that most agricultural production systems are mainly under pathways 1 and 2, which dictate the subsequent AWM practices. Pathway 4 had isolated adoption in North Africa. SSA exhibited overlaps in opportunities for AWM, whereas North Africa had green energy and strong extension services. The challenges were unique to each geopolitical region. Policy-related issues affected North Africa, whilst low investment in AWM dominated West Africa. Poor institutional coordination plagued East Africa, whilst low access to extension services affected Southern Africa. The Central African region was undermined by poor management practices that culminated in soil salinity in the agricultural lands. Targeted and scalable investments across interventions are necessary topotentially improve AWM uptake and subsequent food security in the continent. Also, institutional setups are essential in coordinating efforts towards achieving AWM. Extension services are essential information dissemination platforms for adopting effective climate-smart agriculture."

The dataset is expected to improve the accuracy of current and biogeochemistry numerical model. More projects gathering AUVs network will be promoted in future. 
 Marginal seas are usually fulfilled with strongly varying mesoscale eddies (MEs), which evolutions plays vital roles in regulating global oceanic energy equilibrium, triggering subemesoscale processes with strong vertical velocity, and inducing high biogeochemistry transport. But the temporal evolutions of MEs and submesoscale processes with several kilometers’ resolutions are difficult to be measured by traditional observations with passive working mode. The automatic underwater gliders (AUGs) and vehicles (AUVs) positively observe oceanic motion, and could provide us spatiotemporal synchronization information for strongly varying MEs. Here, we present a 9-year high dense dataset of AUVs/AUGs observations in 2014–2022 in the South China Sea (SCS) can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.11996 (Qiu et al., 2024b). Totally, 9 AUG and 2 AUV cruise experiments were conducted, and 83 AUGs (2 AUVs) equipment were deployed with zonal and temporal resolutions of < 7 km and <6 hour. It covers the area of eddy’s birth, propagation, and dissipation, presenting us the most complete data to investigate the evolution of MEs at different life stages. 40 % of them reach resolutions < 1 km and < 1 hour, which provides us the dynamic characteristics of submesoscale instabilities across and along front at the eddy edge. This dataset has potential in improving the forecast accuracy in physical and biogeochemistry numerical model.

Bacteria-based bioassays offer cost-effective and rapid toxicity assessments. However, the application of these bioassays for air toxicity assessment has been challenging, due to the instability of bacterial survival and functionality when directly exposed to air pollutants. Here, we developed an approach employing self-assembly passive colonization hydrogel (SAPCH) for in situ air toxicity assessment. The SAPCH features a core–shell structure, enabling the quantitatively immobilization of bacteria on its shell while continuously provides nutrients from its core. An antimicrobial polyelectrolyte layer between the core and shell confines bacteria to the air–liquid interface, synchronizing bacterial survival with exposure to air pollutants. The SAPCH immobilized a battery of natural and recombinant luminescent bacteria, enabling simultaneous detection of various toxicological endpoints (cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and oxidative stress) of air pollutants within 2 h. Its sensitivity was 3–5 orders of magnitude greater than that of traditional liquid-phase toxicity testing, and successfully evaluating the toxicity of volatile organic compounds and combustion smoke.

Our findings reveal substantial groundwater seepage concentrated near the knickpoint of the main river stem. Using parsimonious groundwater flow modeling, we validate the hypothesis that the topographical shape of the knickpoint enhances local groundwater discharge rates.

Stable oxygen isotopes in precipitation integrate hydroclimatic changes during the SASM mature phase from December to February (DJF) in response to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and El Niño—Southern Oscillation (ENSO), respectively. Here, results from the isotope‐enabled Community Atmosphere Model v.5 are compared with highly resolved and precisely dated isotopic records from speleothems, tree rings, lake and ice cores during the industrial era (1880–2000 CE) and validated against observations from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) network. Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are coupled to the isotopic composition of SASM precipitation through perturbations in the Walker circulation associated with low‐ (IPO) and high‐frequency (ENSO) variability, impacting convective activity over tropical South America and the tropical Atlantic. Changes in convection over this monsoon entrance region ultimately control the downstream oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation recorded in paleoclimate archives. Overall, model results, paleoclimate records and IAEA data agree on the isotopic response to Pacific SST forcing. These results highlight the potential for long isotopic paleoclimate records to reconstruct Pacific climate variability on both high‐ and low‐frequency timescales.

Two opposing scenarios were proposed to explain the tight regulation of this intracellular process: a template-mediated process that relies on preformed scaffolds, or a template-independent self-assembly process. The present work points to a third scenario, where the SDV membrane is a dynamic mold that shapes the forming silica. We use in-cell cryo-electron tomography to visualize the silicification process in situ, in its native-state, and with a nanometer-scale resolution. This reveals that the plasma membrane interacts with the SDV membrane via physical tethering at membrane contact sites, where the curvature of the tethered side of the SDV membrane mirrors the intricate silica topography. We propose that silica growth and morphogenesis result from the biophysical properties of the SDV and plasma membranes. The silica cell wall of unicellular algae has intricate architecture unattainable by current technology. In this work it is shown that membrane contact sites are the biological morphogenesis handles to shape such intracellular mineralization."

 Importin β-superfamily nuclear import receptors (NIRs) mitigate mislocalization and aggregation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), like FUS and TDP-43, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. NIRs potently disaggregate RBPs by recognizing their nuclear localization signal (NLS). However, disease-causing mutations in NLS compromise NIR binding and activity. Here, we define features that characterize the anti-aggregation activity of NIR and NLS. We find that high binding affinity between NIR and NLS, and optimal NLS location relative to the aggregating domain plays a role in determining NIR disaggregation activity. A designed FUS chimera (FUSIBB), carrying the importin β binding (IBB) domain, is solubilized by importin β in vitro, translocated to the nucleus in cultured cells, and downregulates the expression of endogenous FUS. In this study, we posit that guiding the mutual recognition of NLSs and NIRs will aid the development of therapeutics, illustrated by the highly soluble FUSIBB replacing the aggregation-prone endogenous FUS.

Here the authors identify that USP26 deubiquitinase drives the progression of HBV-associated HCC via regulating the protein stability of Sirtuin 1. 
 Despite recent advances in systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced HCC patients remains poor. By screening a sgRNA library targeting human deubiquitinases, we find that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 26 (USP26) deficiency impairs HBV-positive HCC cell proliferation. Genetically engineered murine models with Usp26 knockout confirm that Usp26 drives HCC tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, we find that the HBV-encoded protein HBx binds to the promoter and induces the production of USP26, which is an X-linked gene exclusively expressed in the testis. HBx consequently promotes the association of USP26 with SIRT1 to synergistically stabilize SIRT1 by deubiquitination, which promotes cell proliferation and impedes cell apoptosis to accelerate HCC tumorigenesis. In patients with HBV-positive HCC, USP26 is robustly induced, and its levels correlate with SIRT1 levels and poor prognosis. Collectively, our study highlights a causative link between HBV infection, deubiquitinase induction and development of HCC, identifying a druggable target, USP26.

 Meningiomas are associated with inactivation of NF2/Merlin, but approximately one-third of meningiomas with favorable clinical outcomes retain Merlin expression. Biochemical mechanisms underlying Merlin-intact meningioma growth are incompletely understood, and non-invasive biomarkers that may be used to guide treatment de-escalation or imaging surveillance are lacking. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing, proximity-labeling proteomic mass spectrometry, mechanistic and functional approaches, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) across meningioma xenografts and patients to define biochemical mechanisms and an imaging biomarker that underlie Merlin-intact meningiomas. We find Merlin serine 13 (S13) dephosphorylation drives meningioma Wnt signaling and tumor growth by attenuating inhibitory interactions with β-catenin and activating the Wnt pathway. MRI analyses show Merlin-intact meningiomas with S13 phosphorylation and favorable clinical outcomes are associated with high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).

 Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare Parkinsonian disorder, is characterized by problems with movement, balance, and cognition. PSP differs from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other diseases, displaying abnormal microtubule-associated protein tau by both neuronal and glial cell pathologies. Genetic contributors may mediate these differences; however, the genetics of PSP remain underexplored. Here we conduct the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSP which includes 2779 cases (2595 neuropathologically-confirmed) and 5584 controls and identify six independent PSP susceptibility loci with genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10−8) associations, including five known (MAPT, MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2) and one novel locus (C4A). Integration with cell type-specific epigenomic annotations reveal an oligodendrocytic signature that might distinguish PSP from AD and Parkinson’s disease in subsequent studies. Candidate PSP risk gene prioritization using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) identifies oligodendrocyte-specific effects on gene expression in half of the genome-wide significant loci, and an association with C4A expression in brain tissue, which may be driven by increased C4A copy number. Finally, histological studies demonstrate tau aggregates in oligodendrocytes that colocalize with C4 (complement) deposition. Integrating GWAS with functional studies, epigenomic and eQTL analyses, we identify potential causal roles for variation in MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2, and C4A in PSP pathogenesis.

 The southern Himalayas, characterized by its dense population and hot, humid summers, are confronted with some of the world’s most severe heat stress risks. This study uses the hourly ERA5 dataset (1979–2022) and CMIP6 projections (2005–2100) to evaluate past and future heat stress based on the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). This has significant implications for the management of occupational workloads in the southern Himalayas. Heat stress levels are classified into 6 categories (0 to 5) using WBGT threshold intervals of 23 °C, 25 °C, 28 °C, 30 °C, and 33 °C. With heat stress surpassing level 3 for almost half of the time, people are constrained to engage in less than moderate workloads to ensure their health remains uncompromised. Flow-analogous algorithm is employed to contextualize the unprecedented heat stress case in the summer of 2020 and the associated atmospheric circulation patterns from historical and future perspectives. The results show that over 80% of the time in 2020, heat stress levels were at 3 and 4. The identified circulation pattern explains 27.6% of the extreme intensity, and such an extreme would have been nearly impossible in pre-21st-century climate conditions under the identified pattern. Future projections under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios indicate that heat stress similar to what was experienced in 2020 will likely become a common occurrence across the southern Himalayas. Under a similar circulation pattern, the heat stress levels by the end of the 21st century would be elevated by at least one category compared to the climatic baseline in over 70% of the region, leading to an additional 120.5 (420.1) million daily population exposed to the highest heat stress level under the SSP2-4.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario."

This threat frequently coexists with human-induced calamities, such as domestic and international conflicts and civil unrest, which could exacerbate the socio-economic instability already present in the region. Using a novel data-driven approach, we evaluated how drought risk in Africa affects the security of various crucial sectors of sustainable development, such as agriculture, water, and food nutrition/health (referred here as ‘nutritional’). Our findings show that different sectors and geographical areas exhibit distinct risk footprints. In Central African countries, for instance, we found that social instability linked to higher nutritional risk is more prevalent than that resulting from the agriculture and water sectors. Socio-economic volatility rather than uncertainty in the climate is the primary driver of this elevated nutritional risk. However, most Northern African countries are at risk of considerable agriculture and water insecurity because of extreme water stress and unstable climate trends. We indicate that the risk is majorly driven by recurrent drought events in Southern Africa, which significantly affect inclusive sectoral securities. The cause of higher risks in Eastern and Western Africa has been found to be an unfavorable interaction of all the risk components—vulnerability, exposure, and hazard. Notably, basic amenities, climate stability, and access to sustainable and renewable water sources are often missing from Africa’s sectoral risk hotspots. Our results emphasize the necessity of maximizing the efficacy of bottom-up initiatives to achieve sustainable food and water security, by integrating socio-economic policies and climate change at the granular level through observation."

The study examines the best numerical settings for fast and accurate solutions. The paper shows how the APT can handle complex problems in high-resolution models. 
 The Accelerated Pseudo-Transient (APT) method is a matrix-free approach used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), characterized by its reliance on local operations, which makes it highly suitable for parallelization. With the advent of the memory-wall phenomenon around 2005, where memory access speed overtook floating-point operations as the bottleneck in high-performance computing, the APT method has gained prominence as a powerful tool for tackling various PDEs in geosciences. Recent advancements have demonstrated the APT method's computational efficiency, particularly when applied to quasi-static nonlinear problems using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). This manuscript presents a comprehensive analysis of the APT method, focusing on its application to quasi-static elastic, viscoelastic, and coupled hydro-mechanical problems, specifically those governed by quasi-static Biot's poroelastic equations, across 1D, 2D, and 3D domains. We systematically investigate the optimal numerical parameters required to achieve rapid convergence, offering valuable insights into the method's applicability and efficiency for a range of physical models. Our findings are validated against analytical solutions, underscoring the robustness and accuracy of the APT method in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. We explore the influence of boundary conditions, non-linearities, and coupling on the optimal convergence parameters, highlighting the method's adaptability in addressing complex and realistic scenarios. To demonstrate the flexibility of the APT method, we apply it to the nonlinear mechanical problem of strain localization using a poro-elasto-viscoplastic rheological model, achieving extremely high resolutions – 10,0002 voxels in 2D and 5123 voxels in 3D – that, to our knowledge, have not been previously explored for such models. Our study contributes significantly to the field by providing a robust framework for the effective implementation of the APT method in solving challenging geophysical problems.

Reick;Reiner Schnur;Axel Kleidon;Martin Claussen,The new plant functional diversity model JeDi-BACH (version 1.0) in the ICON Earth System Model (version 1.0),"We introduce the new plant functional diversity model JeDi-BACH, a novel tool that integrates the Jena Diversity Model (JeDi) within the land component of the ICON Earth System Model. JeDi-BACH captures a richer set of plant trait variations based on environmental filtering and functional tradeoffs without a priori knowledge of the vegetation types. JeDi-BACH represents a significant advancement in modeling the complex interactions between plant functional diversity and climate. 
 While it is clear that vegetation takes part in shaping terrestrial climate through various interactions with the atmosphere, it is not so obvious what role plant functional diversity plays here. So far a tool for investigating this question in land-atmosphere simulations was missing. The new tool JeDi-BACH (version 1.0), described here, closes this gap by combining the Jena Diversity Model (JeDi) with the land component JSBACHv4 of the ICON Earth System Model (version 1.0). In practice, the low-diversity plant parametrization of JSBACH employing plant functional types (PFTs) was replaced by the trait-based high-diversity vegetation description of JeDi. The novelty of JeDi is that the composition of terrestrial ecosystems emerges dynamically from environmental filtering based on functional trade-offs. Thereby, in contrast to the PFT approach, a richer set of plant strategies adapted to the ruling environmental conditions is obtained without a priori knowledge of the vegetation distribution. Besides documentation of this new implementation of JeDi, the paper also presents results from first exploratory simulations with interactive land-atmosphere coupling. We find a systematic dependence of terrestrial climate on diversity. Moreover, when investigating the reaction to changes in trait parameters, we find that at low diversity, climate depends strongly on the particular composition of vegetation, while at high diversity terrestrial climate proves to be rather resilient due to a dynamic re-organization of the plant community structure. Apparently, the many more dynamic degrees of freedom of the highly diverse vegetation in JeDi-BACH make this model behave very differently (less tunable) than conventional land components based on only a few PFTs. Besides fundamental research on the relation between diversity and climate, JeDi-BACH may be useful for the investigation of non-analogue climates (e.g., paleoclimate) where we lack knowledge on the structure and distribution of vegetation."

However, concerns arise over emerging contaminants, such as microplastics (MPs), which remain largely unregulated. Despite their common use in Australia, the transfer of MPs from biosolids to agricultural soils remains largely unknown. Herein, we have investigated the abundance, characteristics, and transport of MPs resulting from biosolids application in two Queensland agricultural sites. MP concentrations were significantly higher in biosolid-amended soils (average of 1137 MPs/kg) than in reference sites (average of 36 MPs/kg), correlating with the volume, time since application, and frequency of biosolids application. MPs > 25 μm were predominantly polyethylene, polypropylene, and poly(methyl methacrylate) fragments (up to 85%). Fibers constitute only 15–30% of MPs and mainly in larger sizes (average 1011 μm), whereas fragments (average 188 μm) and beads (average 72 μm) had smaller size ranges. Despite analytical challenges using Raman spectroscopy, detected smaller MPs (1–25 μm) were fragments composed of polyethylene, polypropylene, and poly(vinyl alcohol). This study provides the first report of MPs down to 1 μm in Australian agricultural soils. Our findings suggest a need to assess the long-term impact of MPs in biosolids on soil health and food safety. We call on policymakers to consider the implementation of effective MP source control strategies and the development of guidelines for acceptable biosolids application rates."

In this work, we developed an analytical framework that combines liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with acidic triiodide-chemiluminescence analysis to characterize the composition and fate of total N-nitrosamines (TONO) and their precursors along the treatment trains of eight WWTPs in New York. Through the parallel application of LC-HRMS and chemiluminescence methods, the TONO scores for 41 N-nitrosamines containing structurally diverse substituents on their amine nitrogen were derived based on their solid-phase extraction recoveries and conversion efficiencies to nitric oxide. Correcting the compositional analysis of TONO using the TONO scores of target N-nitrosamines refined the assessment of the reduction or accumulation of TONO and their precursors across treatment steps in WWTPs. Nontargeted analysis prioritized seven additional N-nitrosamines for confirmation by reference standards, including three previously uncharacterized species: N-nitroso-tert-butylphenylamine, N-nitroso-2-pyrrolidinmethanol, and N-nitrosodesloratadine, although they only served as minor components of TONO.

Mercury speciation profiles in flue gas are different among these sources, leading to significant variations in local atmospheric Hg deposition. To quantify the impacts of Hg emissions from CFPPs and CPs on local-scale atmospheric Hg deposition, this study determined concentrations and isotopes of ambient gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), particulate-bound mercury (PBM), and precipitation total Hg (THg) at multiple locations with different distances away from a CFPP and a CP. Higher concentrations of GEM and precipitation THg in the CFPP area in summer were caused by higher Hg emission from the CFPP, resulting from higher electricity demand. Higher concentrations of GEM, PBM, and precipitation THg in the CP area in winter compared to those in summer were related to the higher output of cement. Atmospheric Hg concentration peaked near the CFPP and CP and decreased with distance from the plants. Elevated GEM concentration in the CFPP area was due to flue gas Hg0 emissions, and high PBM and precipitation Hg concentrations in the CP area were attributed to divalent Hg emissions. It was estimated that Hg emissions from the CFPP contributed 58.3 ± 20.9 and 52.3 ± 25.9% to local GEM and PBM, respectively, and those from the CP contributed 47.0 ± 16.7 and 60.0 ± 25.9% to local GEM and PBM, respectively. This study demonstrates that speciated Hg from anthropogenic emissions posed distinct impacts on the local atmospheric Hg cycle, indicating that Hg speciation profiles from these sources should be considered for evaluating the effectiveness of emission reduction policies. This study also highlights the Hg isotope as a useful tool for monitoring environmental Hg emissions."

Understanding the aging process is crucial for evaluating MPs’ environmental behaviors and risks, but tracing the aging process remains challenging. Here, we propose a multimodal deep learning model to trace typical aging factors of aged MPs based on MPs’ physicochemical characteristics. A total of 1353 surface morphology images and 1353 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra were achieved from 130 aged MPs undergoing different aging processes, demonstrating that physicochemical properties of aged MPs vary from aging processes. The multimodal deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting the major aging factors of aged MPs. The multimodal deep learning model improves the model’s accuracy by approximately 5–20% and reduces prediction bias compared to the single-modal model. In practice, the established model was performed to predict the major aging factors of naturally aged MPs collected from typical environment matrices. The prediction results aligned with the aging conditions of specific environments, as reported in previous studies. Our findings provide new insights into tracing and understanding the plastic aging process, contributing more accurately to the environmental risk assessment of aged MPs."

However, the specific role of water in these reactions remains unclear. In this study, we innovatively propose that H2O-driven surface lattice oxygen activation in γ-MnO2 significantly enhances low-temperature NH3–SCR. The proton from water dissociation activates the surface lattice oxygen in γ-MnO2, giving rise to a doubling of catalytic activity (achieving 90% NO conversion at 100 °C) and remarkable stability. Comprehensive in situ characterizations and calculations reveal that spontaneous proton diffusion to the surface lattice oxygen reduces the orbital overlap between the protonated oxygen atom and its neighboring Mn atom. Consequently, the Mn–O bond is weakened and the surface lattice oxygen is effectively activated to provide excess oxygen vacancies available for converting O2 into O2–. Therefore, the redox property of Mn–H is improved, leading to enhanced NH3 oxidation-dehydrogenation and NO oxidation processes, which are crucial for low-temperature NH3–SCR. This work provides a deeper understanding and fresh perspectives on the water promotion mechanism in low-temperature NOx elimination."

Here, an artificially antibiotic-resistant bacterial community (ARBC) combined with five different constructed antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) with single antibiotic resistance, namely, kanamycin (KAN), tetracycline (TET), cefotaxime (CTX), polymyxin B (PB), or gentamicin (GEM), was studied for the stress response to photocatalysis. With photocatalytic inactivation, the transfer and diffusion of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the ARBC decreased, and fewer multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) emerged in aquatic environments. After several days of photocatalytic inactivation or Luria broth cultivation, >90% ARB were transformed to antibiotic-susceptible bacteria by discarding ARGs. Bacteria with double antibiotic resistance were the dominant species (99%) of residual ARB. The changes in ARG abundance varied, decreasing for the GEM and TET resistance genes and increasing for the KAN resistance genes. The change in the antibiotic resistance level was consistent with the change in ARG abundance. Correspondingly, point mutations occurred for the KAN, CTX and PB resistance genes after photocatalytic inactivation, which might be the reason why these genes persisted longer in the studied ARBC. In summary, photocatalytic inactivation could reduce the abundance of some ARGs and inhibit the emergence of MDRB as well as block ARG transfer in the bacterial community in aquatic environments. This work highlights the advantages of long-term photocatalytic inactivation for controlling antibiotic resistance and facilitates a better understanding of bacterial communities in real aquatic environments."

Here, using target and nontarget analyses, we investigated 50 target PFAS in firefighting foams currently utilized in China, identified novel PFAS, and discovered new end products through a total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay. We identified a total of 54 PFAS compounds (spanning 34 classes and containing seven novel PFAS) with total PFAS concentrations of 0.03–21.21 mM. Among seven novel PFAS, four PFAS met persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity criteria, and another PFAS had the highest ToxPi score among the identified 54 PFAS. Moreover, the predominant PFAS varied significantly in the studied foams and differed markedly from those used in other countries. After the TOP assay, nontarget analysis uncovered 1.1–55.5% more PFAS precursors and 8.25–55.5% more fluorine equivalents compared to traditional target analysis combined with TOP assay. Specifically, three double-bond perfluorinated alcohols were identified for the first time as end products of the TOP assay.

However, when candidate ILs fall into the extrapolation zone of ML models, predictions may become unreliable, leading to poor decision-making. In this study, we introduce a “representation uncertainty” (RU) approach to quantify prediction uncertainty by employing four IL representations: molecular fingerprint, molecular descriptor, molecular image, and molecular graph. We develop four types of ML models based on these representations and calculate RU as the standard deviation of predictions across these models. Compared to traditional model uncertainty (MU), which is based on hyperparameter variations within a single representation, RU outperforms MU in identifying unreliable predictions across four IL property data sets: viscosity, toxicity, refractive index, and CO2 absorption capacity. Furthermore, we develop ensemble models from the four types of models, which show superior predictive performance compared with that of individual models. Using the RU approach, we screened 1420 ILs and identified 37 promising candidates with low viscosity, low toxicity, and high CO2 absorption capacity. The predictive performance of our ensemble model, along with the effectiveness of the RU-based approach, was experimentally validated by testing the CO2 absorption capacity of 14 ILs. This study not only offers a more reliable method for screening and designing ILs, accelerating the discovery process, but also introduces a new perspective on developing ensemble models with enhanced predictive performance."

 Photoenzymes are light-powered biocatalysts that typically rely on the excitation of cofactors or unnatural amino acids for their catalytic activities1,2. A notable natural example is the fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), which uses light energy to convert aliphatic carboxylic acids to achiral hydrocarbons3. Here, we report a way to design a non-natural photodecarboxylase based on the excitation of enzyme-bound catalytic intermediates, instead of relying on cofactor excitation4. Iminium ions5, transiently generated from enals within the active site of an engineered class I aldolase6, can absorb violet light and function as single-electron oxidants. Activation of chiral carboxylic acids, followed by decarboxylation, generates two radicals that undergo stereospecific cross-coupling, yielding products with two stereocenters. Using the appropriate enantiopure chiral substrate, the desired diastereoisomeric product is selectively obtained with complete enantiocontrol. This finding underscores the active site's ability to transfer stereochemical information from the chiral radical precursor into the product, effectively addressing the longstanding problem of rapid racemization of chiral radicals. The resulting ‘memory of chirality’ scenario7 is a rarity in enantioselective radical chemistry."

Here, the authors develop a methodology for the synthesis of cluster-ring-fused 3D aromatic heterocycles, which could find use in functional materials, via the palladium-catalyzed B–H activation of boron clusters. 
 Heteropolycyclic molecular systems, which are essential components in the fields of materials and pharmacology, frequently consist of 2D extended organic aromatic rings. Here, we introduce a type of inorganic-organic hybrid 3D conjugates by merging an aromatic boron cluster with a phosphine and a π-conjugated unit. To achieve this, a couple-close synthetic strategy via B–H activation of nido-carboranes with alkynes has been developed, which leads to diverse boron cluster-extended phosphoniums in a twisted structure with high yields under mild conditions. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the fusion between the boron cluster and the formed borophosphonium heterocycle facilitates electron delocalization throughout the structure. The unusual framework demonstrates distinct properties from bare boron clusters and pure aromatic ring-extended counterparts, such as improved thermal/chemical stability and photophysical properties. Thus, the boron cluster-based 3D conjugates expand the library of aromatic-based heterocyclics, showcasing great potential in functional materials. 2D π-conjugated systems incorporated with heteroatoms can suffer from stability issues and aggregation-induced quenching effects.

Here, the authors find that neonates and toddlers from economically disadvantaged backgrounds show accelerated brain development, with implications for language abilities in toddlerhood. 
 Environmental influences on brain structure and function during early development have been well-characterized, but whether early environments are associated with the pace of brain development is not clear. In pre-registered analyses, we use flexible non-linear models to test the theory that prenatal disadvantage is associated with differences in trajectories of intrinsic brain network development from birth to three years (n = 261). Prenatal disadvantage was assessed using a latent factor of socioeconomic disadvantage that included measures of mother’s income-to-needs ratio, educational attainment, area deprivation index, insurance status, and nutrition. We find that prenatal disadvantage is associated with developmental increases in cortical network segregation, with neonates and toddlers with greater exposure to prenatal disadvantage showing a steeper increase in cortical network segregation with age, consistent with accelerated network development. Associations between prenatal disadvantage and cortical network segregation occur at the local scale and conform to a sensorimotor-association hierarchy of cortical organization. Disadvantage-associated differences in cortical network segregation are associated with language abilities at two years, such that lower segregation is associated with improved language abilities. These results shed light on associations between the early environment and trajectories of cortical development.

 Kitaev chains in quantum dot-superconductor arrays are a promising platform for the realization of topological superconductivity. As recently demonstrated, even a two-site chain can host Majorana zero modes known as “poor man’s Majorana”. Harnessing the potential of these states for quantum information processing, however, requires increasing their robustness to external perturbations. Here, we form a two-site Kitaev chain using Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in proximitized quantum dots. By deterministically tuning the hybridization between the quantum dots and the superconductor, we observe poor man’s Majorana states with a gap larger than 70 μeV. The sensitivity to charge fluctuations is also greatly reduced compared to Kitaev chains made with non-proximitized dots. The systematic control and improved energy scales of poor man’s Majorana states realized with Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states will benefit the realization of longer Kitaev chains, parity qubits, and the demonstration of non-Abelian physics.

 Little is known about biological processes controlling inorganic phosphate (PO4) in groundwater ecosystems. Here we present analyses of groundwater samples from the Hetao Basin, China that show an increasing contribution of microbial cycling to groundwater PO4 from oxic to anoxic conditions along a flow path with phosphate-bound oxygen isotopes (δ18OPO4). Under oxic conditions, although 25–47% of the dissolved PO4 inherited the initial source signal of igneous apatite, groundwater δ18OPO4 reflected a pronounced impact of intracellular enzymatic cycling. Under anoxic conditions, dissolved PO4 carried a nearly exclusive equilibrium isotope signal, which was probably due to (i) release of PO4 with an equilibrium δ18OPO4 from Fe(III) oxides, as a result of Fe(III) reduction in the presence of Fe(III)- and sulfate-reducing bacteria; and/or (ii) cumulative microbial cycling of dissolved PO4 with increasing groundwater residence time. Our study highlights that PO4 in groundwater is tightly microbially cycled under a wide range of redox conditions and microbial cycling contributes to the release of PO4 in groundwater.

 Sea surface currents are of significant importance in various scientific and maritime applications. There are several measurement techniques available to study surface currents, however, they have limitations in spatial coverage and resolution. This study presents a proof-of-concept for a new measurement principle that relies on the difference between a ship’s speed relative to water and land. The approach involves estimating the ship speed vector relative to water from optical satellite imagery of Kelvin wakes. This ship speed vector is subtracted from the ship speed over ground, which is determined from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, to estimate the surface current. A case study in the Strait of Gibraltar was performed using two months of Sentinel-2 imagery, which yielded 81 visible Kelvin wakes over 25 images. Surface currents were estimated in directions parallel and perpendicular to the ship’s sailing line for each Kelvin wake. The estimated currents were validated with respect to surface currents derived from High-Frequency Radars (HFRs) and modelled currents from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The uncertainty in the two surface current components was estimated using triple collocation. After removing 12 data points with large ship course variability, standard deviations of 0.14 and 0.16 m s−1 were estimated for the surface currents along and across the sailing line, respectively. Despite limitations in measurement frequency due to satellite revisit times, cloud cover and Kelvin wake visibility, this new method can provide accurate estimates of sea surface currents in regions with high vessel density."

 High-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are essential for precise geographic analysis. However, obtaining high-resolution DEMs in regions with dense vegetation, complex terrain, or satellite imagery voids presents substantial challenges.

The elevation accuracy of the reconstructed DEMs by the proposed method is 5.30 m, which is higher than that of the 2D terrain features method (18.90 m) by 71.96 %. Meanwhile, the proposed method shows a 15.78 % and 17.64 % improvement in elevation accuracy and slope accuracy, respectively, when reconstructing a 5 m high-resolution DEM from a 30 m low-resolution DEM.

 Assessing the quality of UAV-HSIs (Unmanned aerial vehicle hyperspectral images) is crucial for evaluating sensor performance, identifying distortion types, and measuring data inversion accuracy. Due to the absence of reference images, UAV-HSI quality assessment leans towards no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), offering versatile applications. NR-IQA methods of remote sensing images using machine learning techniques have emerged, however, NR-IQA methods for UAV-HSIs containing multi-type and multiple distortions have not been developed. This paper introduces an NR-IQA method for UAV-HSI, employing machine learning techniques. We summarize and simulate distortion types in UAV-HSIs, constructing a quality assessment dataset based on 23 original high-quality and 806 simulated degraded UAV-HSIs. Extracting 129 features encompassing texture, color, transform domain, structural, and statistical aspects, we form seven feature sets through random and filtered feature selection algorithms. Ten machine learning quality assessment models are trained using this dataset and feature sets. The results showed that the model with the highest evaluation accuracy was extra trees (ET) (R2 = 0.928, RMSE = 0.326, RPD = 3.601), using feature set 1 that fuses Tamura texture, color, wavelet transform, and mean subtracted contrast normalized (MSCN) coefficient for a total of 11 features, the PLCC and SROCC of its predicted and true quality scores reached 0.963 and 0.925, respectively. In addition, the random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) also had high evaluation accuracies (R2 > 0.9 and RPD > 2.5). These findings underscore the applicability of our proposed machine learning-based NR-IQA method to assess the quality of the UAV-HSIs containing noise, blur, strip noise, and multiple distortions.

 This study introduces an alternate spatial-temporal modeling-assisted InSAR time-series analysis method for mine subsidence mapping, aiming to address the large deformation gradients and decorrelation issues. The approach employs the iterative Modeling-Assisted Phase Unwrapping (MA-PU) algorithm for spatial phase unwrapping, and integrates it with temporal models to derive the deformation time-series. Four different inversion procedures are implemented to derive the time-series based on pixel types. The MA-PU method’s effectiveness in handling phase gradients is validated with simulations and real data analysis, showing superiority over non-model-based methods. The incorporation with temporal modeling and time-series inversion demonstrates advantages over time-series inversion alone in dealing with rank-deficiency issues within subsidence zones. The approach is applied to the West Cliff Colliery, Australia, using 23 ALOS-1 data. Results have been compared with GNSS data for validation. Obtained accuracy is approximately 16 mm, with a correlation of 0.99 between the two measurements, showing generally better performances compared to other methods.

In parallel treatments with equal doses of Fe3O4 (∼200 nm), Cr2O3 (∼300 nm), CuO (∼30 nm), and ZnO (∼40 nm) (20–200 μg), the retention percentage of Fe in the leaves (21.0–69.0%) was higher than that of Cr, Cu, and Zn (0.5–14.0%). The steric hindrance effect seems more important for NPs of >200 nm, while hydrophobic surface and negative charge promote the foliar uptake of NPs smaller than 200 nm. The accumulation of NPs in the cuticle was observed through dark-field hyperspectral microscopy. Cr2O3, Fe3O4, and CuO NPs were difficult to penetrate the cuticle.

However, studies investigating their high-resolution vertical distribution in sediments from the European waters to the Arctic remain limited. This study examines MPs in five sediment cores from the Norwegian Coastal Current (NCC), encompassing the water-sediment interface and sediment layers up to 19 cm depth. Advanced analytical methods for MP identification down to 11 μm in size were combined with radiometric dating and lithology observations. MPs were present across all sediment cores, including layers predating the introduction of plastics, with concentrations exhibiting significant variation (54–12,491 MP kg–1). The smallest size class (11 μm) predominated in most sediment layers (34–100%). A total of 18 different polymer types were identified across all sediment layers, with polymer diversity and depth correlations varying widely between stations. Our findings suggest that differences in seafloor topography and the impact of anthropogenic activities (e.g., fishing) lead to varying environmental conditions at the sampling sites, influencing the vertical distribution of MPs. This challenges the reliability of using environmental parameters to predict MP accumulation zones and questions the use of MPs in sediment cores as indicators of the Anthropocene."

A Microbiome Perspective","As water reuse applications expand, there is a need for more comprehensive means to assess water quality. Microbiome analysis could provide the ability to supplement fecal indicators and pathogen profiling toward defining a “healthy” drinking water microbiota while also providing insight into the impact of treatment and distribution. Here, we utilized 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to identify signature features in the composition of microbiota across a wide spectrum of water types (potable conventional, potable reuse, and nonpotable reuse). A clear distinction was found in the composition of microbiota as a function of intended water use (e.g., potable vs nonpotable) across a very broad range of U.S. water systems at both the point of compliance (Betadisper p > 0.01; ANOSIM p < 0.01, r-stat = 0.71) and point of use (Betadisper p > 0.01; ANOSIM p < 0.01, r-stat = 0.41). Core and discriminatory analysis further served in identifying distinct differences between potable and nonpotable water microbiomes. Taxa were identified at both the phylum (Desulfobacterota, Patescibacteria, and Myxococcota) and genus (Aeromonas and NS11.12_marine_group) levels that effectively discriminated between potable and nonpotable waters, with the most discriminatory taxa being core/abundant in nonpotable waters (with few exceptions, such as Ralstonia being abundant in potable conventional waters).

In contrast, research on the potential release and ecological impact of microfibers from washable masks (WMs), suggested as an eco-friendly alternative, is currently lacking. Here, we comprehensively investigated the release of microfibers from disposable and WMs of different types in simulated aquatic environments and real-life scenarios, including shaking, disinfection, hand washing, and machine washing. Using a combination of wide-field fluorescence microscopy, He-ion microscopy, and confocal μ-Raman spectroscopy, we revealed that disposable masks (DMs) released microfibers ranging from 18 to 3042 microfiber/piece, whereas WMs released 6.1 × 104–6.7 × 106 microfibers/piece depending on the simulated conditions above. Another noteworthy finding was the observed negative correlation between microfiber release and the proportion of reinforcement (embossing) on the DM surfaces. Microfibers from tested DMs primarily comprised polypropylene (PP), while WMs predominantly released poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and cellulose microfibers. Furthermore, acute toxicological analyses unveiled that PP microfibers (0.01–50 mg/L) from DMs impacted zebrafish larval swimming behavior, while PET microfibers from WMs delayed early-stage zebrafish hatching.

Utilizing lab incubations, isotope signatures of Hg(0) emitted from mining soils were characterized to quantify the interplay and contributions of various Hg reduction pathways, which have been scarcely studied. At 15 °C, microbial reduced Hg(0) showed a negative mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) (δ202Hg = −0.30 ± 0.08‰, 1SD) and near-zero mass-independent fractionation (MIF) (Δ199Hg = 0.01 ± 0.04‰, 1SD), closely resembling dark reduced Hg(0) (δ202Hg = −0.18 ± 0.05‰, Δ199Hg = −0.01 ± 0.03‰, 1SD). In comparison, photoreduced Hg(0) exhibited significant MDF and MIF (δ202Hg = −0.55 ± 0.05‰, Δ199Hg = −0.20 ± 0.07‰, 1SD). In the dark, Hg isotopic signatures remained constant over the temperature range of 15–35 °C. Nonetheless, light exposure and temperature changes together altered Hg(0) MIF signatures significantly. Isotope mixing models along with Hg(0) emission flux data highlighted photo- and microbial reduction contributing 79–88 and 12–21%, respectively, of the total Hg(0) emissions from mining soils, with negligible abiotic dark reduction. Microorganisms are the key driver of soil Hg(0) emissions by first dissolving HgS and then promoting ionic Hg formation, followed by facilitating the photo- and microbial reduction of organically bound Hg.

Electrochemical leaching occurs in the aqueous electrolyte for converting solid LiCoO2 into soluble Li+ and Co2+, in which electrons act as reductants to reduce Co(III) to Co(II). Simultaneously, solvent extraction occurs at the interface of aqueous and organic phases to separate Co2+ and Li+. By capturing and utilizing the protons from P507, leaching yields for both Co and Li exceed ∼7 times than acid leaching without solvent extraction. The extraction efficiency of Co2+ reaches 86% at 60 °C, 3.5 V, while simultaneously retaining the majority of Li+ in the H2SO4 solution. The total leaching amount was improved because the organic phase provides protons to help the leaching of Co2+, and the continuous extraction process of Co(II) maintains the low Co2+ concentration in the aqueous solution. The synergistic interaction between electrochemical leaching and solvent extraction processes significantly reduces the consumption of chemicals, enhances the utilization efficiency of protons, and simplifies the recovery process. The leaching kinetics of Li and Co both conforms well to the residue layer diffusion control model and the activation energy (Ea) values of the leaching for Li and Co are 4.03 and 7.80 kJ/mol, respectively. Lastly, the economic and environmental assessment of this process also demonstrates the advantages of this method in reducing inputs, lowering environmental pollution, and enhancing economic benefits."

The responses to warming in the waviness metrics Sinuosity Index and Local Wave Activity are sensitive to the latitude range over which they are calculated. Therefore, we use a latitude range that accurately represents the position of the jet. The uniform warming scenario strengthens the jet and reduces large wave amplitudes. Reductions in meridional temperature gradients lead to weakened mid‐latitudinal jet strength and show significant decreases in large wave amplitudes and jet stream waviness. These findings contradict the mechanism that weakened jet streams increase wave amplitudes and extreme jet stream waviness. We conclude that weakened jet streams do not necessarily become wavier."

 The establishment of an early pro-regenerative niche is crucial for tissue regeneration1,2. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent pyroptosis accounts for the release of inflammatory cytokines upon various insults3-5. However, little is known about its role in tissue regeneration followed by homeostatic maintenance. Here, we show that macrophage GSDMD deficiency delayed tissue recovery, with little impact on the local inflammatory milieu or the lytic pyroptosis process. Metabolite secretome profiling of hyperactivated macrophages unveiled the non-canonical metabolite-secreting function of GSDMD. And we further identified 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) as a bioactive pro-healing oxylipin, secreted from hyperactive macrophages in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Indeed, accumulation of 11,12-EET by direct supplementation or deletion of its hydrolytic enzyme Ephx2 accelerated muscle regeneration. We further demonstrated that the Ephx2 level accumulated within aged muscle. And consecutive 11,12-EET treatment rejuvenated aged muscle. Mechanistically, 11,12-EET amplifies FGF-FGFR signaling by modulating FGF liquid-liquid phase separation, hence boosting the activation and proliferation of muscle stem cells (MuSCs).

 Chromatin structure is a key regulator of DNA transcription, replication, and repair1. In humans, the TIP60/EP400 complex (TIP60-C) is a 20-subunit assembly that impacts chromatin structure via two enzymatic activities: ATP-dependent exchange of histone H2A/H2B for H2A.Z/H2B and histone acetylation, which in yeast are carried out by two independent complexes, SWR1 and NuA4, respectively2,3. How these activities are merged in humans into one super-complex and what this association entails for their structure, mechanism and recruitment to chromatin is unknown. Here we describe the 2.4-3.3 Å resolution structure of the endogenous human TIP60-C. We find a three lobed architecture composed of SWR1-like (SWR1L) and NuA4-like (NuA4L) parts, that associate with a TRRAP activator-binding module. The huge EP400 subunit harbors the ATPase motor, traverses twice the junction between SWR1L and NuA4L, and constitutes the scaffold of the three-lobed architecture. NuA4L is completely re-arranged compared to its yeast counterpart. TRRAP is flexibly tethered to NuA4L, in stark contrast to its robust connection to the complete opposite side of yeast NuA44-7. A modeled nucleosome bound to SWR1L, supported by activity tests, suggests that some aspects of the histone exchange mechanism diverge from the yeast example8,9. Furthermore, a fixed actin module, as opposed to the mobile actin subcomplex in SWR18, the flexibility of TRRAP and the weak effect of extra-nucleosomal DNA on exchange activity, lead to a different, activator-based, mode of enlisting TIP60-C to chromatin."

 Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the abnormal filamentous assembly of specific proteins in the central nervous system1. Human genetic studies established a causal role for protein assembly in neurodegeneration2. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, which is limiting progress in developing clinical tools for these diseases. Recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structures of the protein filaments to be determined from patient brains1. All diseases studied to date have been characterised by the self-assembly of proteins in homomeric amyloid filaments, including that of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) Types A and B3,4. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine filament structures from the brains of individuals with FTLD-TDP Type C, one of the most common forms of sporadic FTLD-TDP. Unexpectedly, the structures revealed that a second protein, annexin A11 (ANXA11), co-assembles with TDP-43 in heteromeric amyloid filaments. The ordered filament fold is formed by TDP-43 residues G282/284–N345 and ANXA11 residues L39–Y74 from their respective low-complexity domains (LCDs). Regions of TDP-43 and ANXA11 previously implicated in protein-protein interactions form an extensive hydrophobic interface at the centre of the filament fold. Immunoblots of the filaments revealed that the majority of ANXA11 exists as a ~22 kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) lacking the annexin core domain. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections showed the co-localisation of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in inclusions, redefining the histopathology of FTLD-TDP Type C. This work establishes a central role for ANXA11 in FTLD-TDP Type C. The unprecedented formation of heteromeric amyloid filaments in human brain revises our understanding of amyloid assembly and may be of significance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases."

 The transport of energy through convection is important during many stages of stellar evolution1,2, and is best studied in our Sun3 or giant evolved stars4. Features that are attributed to convection are found on the surface of massive red supergiant stars5–8. Also for lower-mass evolved stars, indications of convection are found9–13, but convective timescales and sizes remain poorly constrained. Models indicate that convective motions are crucial to produce strong winds that return the products of stellar nucleosynthesis into the interstellar medium14. Here we report a series of reconstructed interferometric images of the surface of the evolved giant star R Doradus. The images reveal a stellar disk with prominent small-scale features that provide the structure and motions of convection on the stellar surface. We find that the dominant structure size of the features on the stellar disk is 0.72 ± 0.05 astronomical units. We measure the velocity of the surface motions to vary between −18 and +20 km s−1, which means that the convective timescale is approximately one month. This indicates a possible difference between the convection properties of low-mass and high-mass evolved stars.

 Intermolecular distance largely determines the optoelectronic properties of organic matter. Conventional organic luminescent molecules are commonly used either as aggregates or as single molecules that are diluted in a foreigner matrix. They have garnered great research interest in recent decades for a variety of applications, including light-emitting diodes1,2, lasers3–5 and quantum technologies6,7, among others8–10. However, there is still a knowledge gap on how these molecules behave between the aggregation and dilution states. Here we report an unprecedented phase of molecular aggregate that forms in a two-dimensional hybrid perovskite superlattice with a near-equilibrium distance, which we refer to as a single-molecule-like aggregate (SMA). By implementing two-dimensional superlattices, the organic emitters are held in proximity, but, surprisingly, remain electronically isolated, thereby resulting in a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield, akin to that of single molecules. Moreover, the emitters within the perovskite superlattices demonstrate strong alignment and dense packing resembling aggregates, allowing for the observation of robust directional emission, substantially enhanced radiative recombination and efficient lasing. Molecular dynamics simulations together with single-crystal structure analysis emphasize the critical role of the internal rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecules in the two-dimensional lattice for creating the exclusive SMA phase. This two-dimensional superlattice unifies the paradoxical properties of single molecules and aggregates, thus offering exciting possibilities for advanced spectroscopic and photonic applications. A molecular aggregate formed in a two-dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite superlattice with a near-equilibrium distance is shown to have a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield like that of single molecules, despite being in an aggregated state."

 Polar molecules confined in an optical lattice are a versatile platform to explore spin-motion dynamics based on strong, long-range dipolar interactions1,2. The precise tunability3 of Ising and spin-exchange interactions with both microwave and d.c. electric fields makes the molecular system particularly suitable for engineering complex many-body dynamics4–6. Here we used Floquet engineering7 to realize new quantum many-body systems of polar molecules. Using a spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states of ultracold 40K87Rb molecules, we mutually validated XXZ spin models tuned by a Floquet microwave pulse sequence against those tuned by a d.c. electric field through observations of Ramsey contrast dynamics. This validation sets the stage for the realization of Hamiltonians inaccessible with static fields. In particular, we observed two-axis twisting8 mean-field dynamics, generated by a Floquet-engineered XYZ model using itinerant molecules in two-dimensional layers.

 DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination is initiated by DNA end resection, a process involving the controlled degradation of the 5′-terminated strands at DSB sites1,2. The breast cancer suppressor BRCA1–BARD1 not only promotes resection and homologous recombination, but it also protects DNA upon replication stress1,3–9. BRCA1–BARD1 counteracts the anti-resection and pro-non-homologous end-joining factor 53BP1, but whether it functions in resection directly has been unclear10–16. Using purified recombinant proteins, we show here that BRCA1–BARD1 directly promotes long-range DNA end resection pathways catalysed by the EXO1 or DNA2 nucleases. In the DNA2-dependent pathway, BRCA1–BARD1 stimulates DNA unwinding by the Werner or Bloom helicase. Together with MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 and phosphorylated CtIP, BRCA1–BARD1 forms the BRCA1–C complex17,18, which stimulates resection synergistically to an even greater extent. A mutation in phosphorylated CtIP (S327A), which disrupts its binding to the BRCT repeats of BRCA1 and hence the integrity of the BRCA1–C complex19–21, inhibits resection, showing that BRCA1–C is a functionally integrated ensemble. Whereas BRCA1–BARD1 stimulates resection in DSB repair, it paradoxically also protects replication forks from unscheduled degradation upon stress, which involves a homologous recombination-independent function of the recombinase RAD51 (refs. 4–6,8). We show that in the presence of RAD51, BRCA1–BARD1 instead inhibits DNA degradation. On the basis of our data, the presence and local concentration of RAD51 might determine the balance between the pronuclease and the DNA protection functions of BRCA1–BARD1 in various physiological contexts. BRCA1–BARD1 directly promotes double-strand break repair by stimulating long-range DNA end resection pathways."

 Layer 5 extratelencephalic (ET) neurons are present across neocortical areas and send axons to multiple subcortical targets1–6. Two cardinal subtypes exist7,8: (1) Slco2a1-expressing neurons (ETdist), which predominate in the motor cortex and project distally to the pons, medulla and spinal cord; and (2) Nprs1- or Hpgd-expressing neurons (ETprox), which predominate in the visual cortex and project more proximally to the pons and thalamus. An understanding of how area-specific ETdist and ETprox emerge during development is important because they are critical for fine motor skills and are susceptible to spinal cord injury and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis9–12. Here, using cross-areal mapping of axonal projections in the mouse neocortex, we identify the subtype-specific developmental dynamics of ET neurons. Whereas subsets of ETprox emerge by pruning of ETdist axons, others emerge de novo. We outline corresponding subtype-specific developmental transcriptional programs using single-nucleus sequencing. Leveraging these findings, we use postnatal in vivo knockdown of subtype-specific transcription factors to reprogram ET neuron connectivity towards more proximal targets. Together, these results show the functional transcriptional programs driving ET neuron diversity and uncover cell subtype-specific gene regulatory networks that can be manipulated to direct target specificity in motor corticofugal pathways.

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the domain of large resource-intensive data centres that limit access to a small community of developers1,2. Neuromorphic hardware promises greatly improved space and energy efficiency for AI but is presently only capable of low-accuracy operations, such as inferencing in neural networks3–5. Core computing tasks of signal processing, neural network training and natural language processing demand far higher computing resolution, beyond that of individual neuromorphic circuit elements6–8. Here we introduce an analog molecular memristor based on a Ru-complex of an azo-aromatic ligand with 14-bit resolution. Precise kinetic control over a transition between two thermodynamically stable molecular electronic states facilitates 16,520 distinct analog conductance levels, which can be linearly and symmetrically updated or written individually in one time step, substantially simplifying the weight update procedure over existing neuromorphic platforms3. The circuit elements are unidirectional, facilitating a selector-less 64 × 64 crossbar-based dot-product engine that enables vector–matrix multiplication, including Fourier transform, in a single time step. We achieved more than 73 dB signal-to-noise-ratio, four orders of magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art methods9–11, while consuming 460× less energy than digital computers12,13.

 The ability to sequence single protein molecules in their native, full-length form would enable a more comprehensive understanding of proteomic diversity. Current technologies, however, are limited in achieving this goal1,2. Here, we establish a method for the long-range, single-molecule reading of intact protein strands on a commercial nanopore sensor array. By using the ClpX unfoldase to ratchet proteins through a CsgG nanopore3,4, we provide single-molecule evidence that ClpX translocates substrates in two-residue steps. This mechanism achieves sensitivity to single amino acids on synthetic protein strands hundreds of amino acids in length, enabling the sequencing of combinations of single-amino-acid substitutions and the mapping of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. To enhance classification accuracy further, we demonstrate the ability to reread individual protein molecules multiple times, and we explore the potential for highly accurate protein barcode sequencing. Furthermore, we develop a biophysical model that can simulate raw nanopore signals a priori on the basis of residue volume and charge, enhancing the interpretation of raw signal data. Finally, we apply these methods to examine full-length, folded protein domains for complete end-to-end analysis.

 The biological pump supplies carbon to the oceans’ interior, driving long-term carbon sequestration and providing energy for deep-sea ecosystems1,2. Its efficiency is set by transformations of newly formed particles in the euphotic zone, followed by vertical flux attenuation via mesopelagic processes3. Depth attenuation of the particulate organic carbon (POC) flux is modulated by multiple processes involving zooplankton and/or microbes4,5. Nevertheless, it continues to be mainly parameterized using an empirically derived relationship, the ‘Martin curve’6. The derived power-law exponent is the standard metric used to compare flux attenuation patterns across oceanic provinces7,8. Here we present in situ experimental findings from C-RESPIRE9, a dual particle interceptor and incubator deployed at multiple mesopelagic depths, measuring microbially mediated POC flux attenuation. We find that across six contrasting oceanic regimes, representing a 30-fold range in POC flux, degradation by particle-attached microbes comprised 7–29 per cent of flux attenuation, implying a more influential role for zooplankton in flux attenuation. Microbial remineralization, normalized to POC flux, ranged by 20-fold across sites and depths, with the lowest rates at high POC fluxes. Vertical trends, of up to threefold changes, were linked to strong temperature gradients at low-latitude sites. In contrast, temperature played a lesser role at mid- and high-latitude sites, where vertical trends may be set jointly by particle biochemistry, fragmentation and microbial ecophysiology. This deconstruction of the Martin curve reveals the underpinning mechanisms that drive microbially mediated POC flux attenuation across oceanic provinces.

 Rapa Nui (also known as Easter Island) is one of the most isolated inhabited places in the world. It has captured the imagination of many owing to its archaeological record, which includes iconic megalithic statues called moai1. Two prominent contentions have arisen from the extensive study of Rapa Nui. First, the history of the Rapanui has been presented as a warning tale of resource overexploitation that would have culminated in a major population collapse—the ‘ecocide’ theory2–4. Second, the possibility of trans-Pacific voyages to the Americas pre-dating European contact is still debated5–7. Here, to address these questions, we reconstructed the genomic history of the Rapanui on the basis of 15 ancient Rapanui individuals that we radiocarbon dated (1670–1950 ce) and whole-genome sequenced (0.4–25.6×). We find that these individuals are Polynesian in origin and most closely related to present-day Rapanui, a finding that will contribute to repatriation efforts. Through effective population size reconstructions and extensive population genetics simulations, we reject a scenario involving a severe population bottleneck during the 1600s, as proposed by the ecocide theory. Furthermore, the ancient and present-day Rapanui carry similar proportions of Native American admixture (about 10%). Using a Bayesian approach integrating genetic and radiocarbon dates, we estimate that this admixture event occurred about 1250–1430 ce.

 Parasitoid wasps are exceptionally diverse and use specialized adaptations capable of manipulating the physiology and behaviour of host organisms1. In more than two centuries since the first records of Drosophila-parasitizing wasps, nearly 200 described and provisional parasitoid species of drosophilids have been identified2. These include endoparasitoids and ectoparasitoids, as well as species attacking larval and pupal hosts3. Despite a deep history of research attention and remarkable biodiversity, a wasp species that attacks and develops inside the adult stage of a fly host has not been described previously. Here we report the discovery of a wasp species that infects the adult stage of fruit flies in the genus Drosophila, including one of the most deeply studied model organisms in biology, Drosophila melanogaster. Notably, this wasp can be easily collected from backyard fly baits and has a broad geographic distribution throughout the eastern USA. We document its life history and unique host interactions, including egg-laying into and larval emergence from adult flies, and provide protocols to raise wasps from wild-caught host flies. Our results emphasize the need for ongoing research investment in insect biodiversity and systematics. As parasitoid research continues to uncover unusual biology and supports fundamental mechanistic insights into immunity4, metabolism5, ecology6, evolution7–9 and behaviour10–12, we anticipate that this wasp’s association with the laboratory model organism, D. melanogaster, will provide new research opportunities across the life sciences.

 Any electrical signal propagating in a metallic conductor loses amplitude due to the natural resistance of the metal. Compensating for such losses presently requires repeatedly breaking the conductor and interposing amplifiers that consume and regenerate the signal. This century-old primitive severely constrains the design and performance of modern interconnect-dense chips1. Here we present a fundamentally different primitive based on semi-stable edge of chaos (EOC)2,3, a long-theorized but experimentally elusive regime that underlies active (self-amplifying) transmission in biological axons4,5. By electrically accessing the spin crossover in LaCoO3, we isolate semi-stable EOC, characterized by small-signal negative resistance and amplification of perturbations6,7. In a metallic line atop a medium biased at EOC, a signal input at one end exits the other end amplified, without passing through a separate amplifying component. While superficially resembling superconductivity, active transmission offers controllably amplified time-varying small-signal propagation at normal temperature and pressure, but requires an electrically energized EOC medium. Operando thermal mapping reveals the mechanism of amplification—bias energy of the EOC medium, instead of fully dissipating as heat, is partly used to amplify signals in the metallic line, thereby enabling spatially continuous active transmission, which could transform the design and performance of complex electronic chips.

 Radiocarbon (14C) is essential for creating chronologies to study the timings and drivers of pivotal events in human history and the Earth system over the past 55,000 years. It is also a fundamental proxy for investigating solar processes, including the potential of the Sun for extreme activity. Until now, fluctuations in past atmospheric 14C levels have limited the dating precision possible using radiocarbon. However, the discovery of solar super-storms known as extreme solar particle events (ESPEs) has driven a series of advances with the potential to transform the calendar-age precision of radiocarbon dating. Organic materials containing unique 14C ESPE signatures can now be dated to annual precision. In parallel, the search for further storms using high-precision annual 14C measurements has revealed fine-scaled variations that can be used to improve calendar-age precision, even in periods that lack ESPEs. Furthermore, the newly identified 14C fluctuations provide unprecedented insight into solar variability and the carbon cycle.

 SAR11 bacteria are the most abundant microorganisms in the surface ocean1 and have global biogeochemical importance2–4.

The functions and properties of these transport proteins are key factors in the assimilation of dissolved organic matter and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients in the ocean, but they have remained largely inaccessible to experimental investigation.

We found that the solute-binding proteins of SAR11 bacteria have extremely high binding affinity (dissociation constant >20 pM) and high binding specificity, revealing molecular mechanisms of oligotrophic adaptation.

 Reliable control of the conductivity and its polarity in semiconductors is at the heart of modern electronics1–7, and has led to key inventions including diodes, transistors, solar cells, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and semiconductor lasers. For archetypal semiconductors such as Si and GaN, positive (p)- and negative (n)-type conductivities are achieved through the doping of electron-accepting and electron-donating elements into the crystal lattices, respectively1–6. For halide perovskites, which are an emerging class of semiconductors, mechanisms for reliably controlling charge conduction behaviours while maintaining high optoelectronic qualities are yet to be discovered. Here we report that the p- and n-type characteristics in a wide-bandgap perovskite semiconductor can be adjusted by incorporating a phosphonic acid molecular dopant with strong electron-withdrawing abilities. The resultant carrier concentrations were more than 1013 cm−3 for the p- and n-type samples, with Hall coefficients ranging from −0.5 m3 C−1 (n-type) to 0.6 m3 C−1 (p-type). A shift of the Fermi level across the bandgap was observed. Importantly, the transition from n- to p-type conductivity was achieved while retaining high photoluminescence quantum yields of 70–85%.

 Although fat is a crucial source of energy in diets, excessive intake leads to obesity. Fat absorption in the gut is prevailingly thought to occur organ-autonomously by diffusion1–3. Whether the process is controlled by the brain-to-gut axis, however, remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (DMV) plays a key part in this process. Inactivation of DMV neurons reduces intestinal fat absorption and consequently causes weight loss, whereas activation of the DMV increases fat absorption and weight gain. Notably, the inactivation of a subpopulation of DMV neurons that project to the jejunum shortens the length of microvilli, thereby reducing fat absorption. Moreover, we identify a natural compound, puerarin, that mimics the suppression of the DMV–vagus pathway, which in turn leads to reduced fat absorption. Photoaffinity chemical methods and cryogenic electron microscopy of the structure of a GABAA receptor–puerarin complex reveal that puerarin binds to an allosteric modulatory site. Notably, conditional Gabra1 knockout in the DMV largely abolishes puerarin-induced intestinal fat loss. In summary, we discover that suppression of the DMV–vagus–jejunum axis controls intestinal fat absorption by shortening the length of microvilli and illustrate the therapeutic potential of puerarin binding to GABRA1 in fat loss. Neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus are involved in the absorption of fat in the intestine, and the natural compound puerarin shows utility in modulating this brain–gut axis to reduce fat absorption."

 Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality1,2. Elevated intracardiac pressures and myocyte stretch in heart failure trigger the release of counter-regulatory natriuretic peptides, which act through their receptor (NPR1) to affect vasodilation, diuresis and natriuresis, lowering venous pressures and relieving venous congestion3–8. Recombinant natriuretic peptide infusions were developed to treat heart failure but have been limited by a short duration of effect9,10. Here we report that in a human genetic analysis of over 700,000 individuals, lifelong exposure to coding variants of the NPR1 gene is associated with changes in blood pressure and risk of heart failure. We describe the development of REGN5381, an investigational monoclonal agonist antibody that targets the membrane-bound guanylate cyclase receptor NPR1. REGN5381, an allosteric agonist of NPR1, induces an active-like receptor conformation that results in haemodynamic effects preferentially on venous vasculature, including reductions in systolic blood pressure and venous pressure in animal models. In healthy human volunteers, REGN5381 produced the expected haemodynamic effects, reflecting reductions in venous pressures, without obvious changes in diuresis and natriuresis. These data support the development of REGN5381 for long-lasting and selective lowering of venous pressures that drive symptomatology in patients with heart failure. Durable agonism of NPR1 achieved with a novel investigational monoclonal antibody could mirror the positive hemodynamic changes in blood pressure and heart failure identified in humans with lifelong exposure to NPR1 coding variants."

 Human genetic studies of common variants have provided substantial insight into the biological mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing1. Here we report analyses of rare protein-coding variants in 106,973 women from the UK Biobank study, implicating genes with effects around five times larger than previously found for common variants (ETAA1, ZNF518A, PNPLA8, PALB2 and SAMHD1). The SAMHD1 association reinforces the link between ovarian ageing and cancer susceptibility1, with damaging germline variants being associated with extended reproductive lifespan and increased all-cause cancer risk in both men and women. Protein-truncating variants in ZNF518A are associated with shorter reproductive lifespan—that is, earlier age at menopause (by 5.61 years) and later age at menarche (by 0.56 years). Finally, using 8,089 sequenced trios from the 100,000 Genomes Project (100kGP), we observe that common genetic variants associated with earlier ovarian ageing associate with an increased rate of maternally derived de novo mutations. Although we were unable to replicate the finding in independent samples from the deCODE study, it is consistent with the expected role of DNA damage response genes in maintaining the genetic integrity of germ cells. This study provides evidence of genetic links between age of menopause and cancer risk.

 Materials with electromechanical coupling are essential for transducers and acoustic devices as reversible converters between mechanical and electrical energy1–6. High electromechanical responses are typically found in materials with strong structural instabilities, conventionally achieved by two strategies—morphotropic phase boundaries7 and nanoscale structural heterogeneity8. Here we demonstrate a different strategy to accomplish ultrahigh electromechanical response by inducing extreme structural instability from competing antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders. Guided by the phase diagram and theoretical calculations, we designed the coexistence of antiferroelectric orthorhombic and ferroelectric rhombohedral phases in sodium niobate thin films. These films show effective piezoelectric coefficients above 5,000 pm V−1 because of electric-field-induced antiferroelectric–ferroelectric phase transitions. Our results provide a general approach to design and exploit antiferroelectric materials for electromechanical devices.

 Perceptual decisions rely on learned associations between sensory evidence and appropriate actions, involving the filtering and integration of relevant inputs to prepare and execute timely responses1,2. Despite the distributed nature of task-relevant representations3–10, it remains unclear how transformations between sensory input, evidence integration, motor planning and execution are orchestrated across brain areas and dimensions of neural activity. Here we addressed this question by recording brain-wide neural activity in mice learning to report changes in ambiguous visual input. After learning, evidence integration emerged across most brain areas in sparse neural populations that drive movement-preparatory activity. Visual responses evolved from transient activations in sensory areas to sustained representations in frontal-motor cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain and cerebellum, enabling parallel evidence accumulation. In areas that accumulate evidence, shared population activity patterns encode visual evidence and movement preparation, distinct from movement-execution dynamics. Activity in movement-preparatory subspace is driven by neurons integrating evidence, which collapses at movement onset, allowing the integration process to reset. Across premotor regions, evidence-integration timescales were independent of intrinsic regional dynamics, and thus depended on task experience. In summary, learning aligns evidence accumulation to action preparation in activity dynamics across dozens of brain regions. This leads to highly distributed and parallelized sensorimotor transformations during decision-making. Our work unifies concepts from decision-making and motor control fields into a brain-wide framework for understanding how sensory evidence controls actions. Brain-wide recordings in mice show that learning leads to sensory evidence integration in many brain areas simultaneously, allowing sensory input to drive global movement preparatory dynamics, which collapse upon movement onset."

 The presence of disorder substantially influences the behaviour of physical systems. It can give rise to slow or glassy dynamics, or to a complete suppression of transport as in Anderson insulators1, where normally extended wavefunctions such as light fields or electronic Bloch waves become exponentially localized. The combined effect of disorder and interactions is central to the richness of condensed-matter physics2. In bosonic systems, it can also lead to additional quantum states such as the Bose glass3,4—an insulating but compressible state without long-range phase coherence that emerges in disordered bosonic systems and is distinct from the well-known superfluid and Mott insulating ground states of interacting bosons. Here we report the experimental realization of the two-dimensional Bose glass using ultracold atoms in an eight-fold symmetric quasicrystalline optical lattice5. By probing the coherence properties of the system, we observe a Bose-glass-to-superfluid transition and map out the phase diagram in the weakly interacting regime. We furthermore demonstrate that it is not possible to adiabatically traverse the Bose glass on typical experimental timescales by examining the capability to restore coherence and discuss the connection to the expected non-ergodicity of the Bose glass. Our observations are in good agreement with recent quantum Monte Carlo predictions6 and pave the way for experimentally testing the connection between the Bose glass, many-body localization and glassy dynamics more generally7,8.

 The origin of the eukaryotic cell, with its compartmentalized nature and generally large size compared with bacterial and archaeal cells, represents a cornerstone event in the evolution of complex life on Earth. In a process referred to as eukaryogenesis, the eukaryotic cell is believed to have evolved between approximately 1.8 and 2.7 billion years ago from its archaeal ancestors, with a symbiosis with a bacterial (proto-mitochondrial) partner being a key event. In the tree of life, the branch separating the first from the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes is long and lacks evolutionary intermediates. As a result, the timing and driving forces of the emergence of complex eukaryotic features remain poorly understood. During the past decade, environmental and comparative genomic studies have revealed vital details about the identity and nature of the host cell and the proto-mitochondrial endosymbiont, enabling a critical reappraisal of hypotheses underlying the symbiotic origin of the eukaryotic cell. Here we outline our current understanding of the key players and events underlying the emergence of cellular complexity during the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition and discuss potential avenues of future research that might provide new insights into the enigmatic origin of the eukaryotic cell.

 The licensing step of DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination entails resection of DNA ends to generate a single-stranded DNA template for assembly of the repair machinery consisting of the RAD51 recombinase and ancillary factors1. DNA end resection is mechanistically intricate and reliant on the tumour suppressor complex BRCA1–BARD1 (ref. 2). Specifically, three distinct nuclease entities—the 5′–3′ exonuclease EXO1 and heterodimeric complexes of the DNA endonuclease DNA2, with either the BLM or WRN helicase—act in synergy to execute the end resection process3. A major question concerns whether BRCA1–BARD1 directly regulates end resection. Here, using highly purified protein factors, we provide evidence that BRCA1–BARD1 physically interacts with EXO1, BLM and WRN. Importantly, with reconstituted biochemical systems and a single-molecule analytical tool, we show that BRCA1–BARD1 upregulates the activity of all three resection pathways. We also demonstrate that BRCA1 and BARD1 harbour stand-alone modules that contribute to the overall functionality of BRCA1–BARD1. Moreover, analysis of a BARD1 mutant impaired in DNA binding shows the importance of this BARD1 attribute in end resection, both in vitro and in cells. Thus, BRCA1–BARD1 enhances the efficiency of all three long-range DNA end resection pathways during homologous recombination in human cells. Using highly purified protein factors, we provide evidence that BRCA1–BARD1 physically interacts with EXO1, BLM and WRN and upregulates the activity of all three resection pathways."

 We can now measure the connectivity of every neuron in a neural circuit1–9, but we cannot measure other biological details, including the dynamical characteristics of each neuron. The degree to which measurements of connectivity alone can inform the understanding of neural computation is an open question10. Here we show that with experimental measurements of only the connectivity of a biological neural network, we can predict the neural activity underlying a specified neural computation. We constructed a model neural network with the experimentally determined connectivity for 64 cell types in the motion pathways of the fruit fly optic lobe1–5 but with unknown parameters for the single-neuron and single-synapse properties. We then optimized the values of these unknown parameters using techniques from deep learning11, to allow the model network to detect visual motion12. Our mechanistic model makes detailed, experimentally testable predictions for each neuron in the connectome. We found that model predictions agreed with experimental measurements of neural activity across 26 studies. Our work demonstrates a strategy for generating detailed hypotheses about the mechanisms of neural circuit function from connectivity measurements. We show that this strategy is more likely to be successful when neurons are sparsely connected—a universally observed feature of biological neural networks across species and brain regions.

 Early amniote development is highly self-organized, capable of adapting to interference through local and long-range cell–cell interactions. This process, called embryonic regulation1, has been well illustrated in experiments on avian embryos, in which subdividing the epiblast disk into different parts not only redirects cell fates to eventually form a complete and well-proportioned embryo at its original location, but also leads to the self-organization of additional, fully formed embryos2,3 in the other separated parts. The cellular interactions underlying embryonic self-organization are widely believed to be mediated by molecular signals, yet the identity of such signals is unclear. Here, by analysing intact and mechanically perturbed quail embryos, we show that the mechanical forces that drive embryogenesis self-organize, with contractility locally self-activating and the ensuing tension acting as a long-range inhibitor. This mechanical feedback governs the persistent pattern of tissue flows that shape the embryo4–6 and also steers the concomitant emergence of embryonic territories by modulating gene expression, ensuring the formation of a single embryo under normal conditions, yet allowing the emergence of multiple, well-proportioned embryos after perturbations. Thus, mechanical forces act at the core of embryonic self-organization, shaping both tissues and gene expression to robustly yet plastically canalize early development.

Here, using pump-probe spectroscopy, the authors detect the coherent dynamics of a nuclear and electron spin of a single hydrogenated Ti atom on MgO surface. 
 The nuclear spin, being much more isolated from the environment than its electronic counterpart, presents opportunities for quantum experiments with prolonged coherence times. Electron spin resonance (ESR) combined with scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) provides a bottom-up platform to study the fundamental properties of nuclear spins of single atoms on a surface. However, access to the time evolution of nuclear spins remained a challenge. Here, we present an experiment resolving the nanosecond coherent dynamics of a hyperfine-driven flip-flop interaction between the spin of an individual nucleus and that of an orbiting electron. We use the unique local controllability of the magnetic field emanating from the STM probe tip to bring the electron and nuclear spins in tune, as evidenced by a set of avoided level crossings in ESR-STM. Subsequently, we polarize both spins through scattering of tunnelling electrons and measure the resulting free evolution of the coupled spin system using a DC pump-probe scheme. The latter reveals a complex pattern of multiple interfering coherent oscillations, providing unique insight into hyperfine physics on a single atom level.

 Three-dimensional (3D) tomography is a powerful investigative tool for many scientific domains, going from materials science, to engineering, to medicine. Many factors may limit the 3D resolution, often spatially anisotropic, compromising the precision of the information retrievable. A neural network, designed for video-frame interpolation, is employed to enhance tomographic images, achieving cubic-voxel resolution. The method is applied to distinct domains: the investigation of the morphology of printed graphene nanosheets networks, obtained via focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM), magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain, and X-ray computed tomography scans of the abdomen. The accuracy of the 3D tomographic maps can be quantified through computer-vision metrics, but most importantly with the precision on the physical quantities retrievable from the reconstructions, in the case of FIB-SEM the porosity, tortuosity, and effective diffusivity. This work showcases a versatile image-augmentation strategy for optimizing 3D tomography acquisition conditions, while preserving the information content.

 Several gaps persist in haptic device development due to the multifaceted nature of the sense of touch. Existing gaps include challenges enhancing touch feedback fidelity, providing diverse haptic sensations, and ensuring wearability for delivering tactile stimuli to the fingertips.

 Extreme weather events cause damage to crops. Quantifying their impact on crop yields in farmers’ fields however remains difficult, as empirical data generally lacks detail, preventing to unravel causal effects from soil and management practices. Here we exploit an observational dataset on potato production on sandy soils in the Netherlands and use a causal method employing a matching strategy to quantify the effect of extreme weather. We provide statistical evidence that drought and high-intensity rainfall in this region have large impact today, explaining 98% of the between-year yield differences. High-intensity rainfall led to a yield reduction of 36% and drought to 13%. Yields highly varied among fields, just as the impact of these weather extremes on individual fields. Identifying on which fields the impact is small provides direction for adaption strategies, which are urgently needed, considering the expected increased frequency of weather extremes according to the latest climate change scenarios.

 Launched by China in 2021, the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) is the world's first science satellite dedicated to serving the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. In keeping with international aims of this 2030 agenda, the SDGSAT-1 data will be made available for open accee without any restrictions. The Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) onboard SDGSAT-1 has three thermal infrared channels with a high spatial resolution of 30 m. This enables precise monitoring of land surface temperature (LST), which is one of the most important variables measured by satellite remote sensing. This paper presents the development and validation of three split-window (SW) algorithms and the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm for SDGSAT-1 TIS data. These algorithms were rigorously tested through simulation, application, and validation to assess their retrieval accuracy and sensitivity. Simulation results indicate that the theoretical accuracy of the SW algorithms exceeds 1.0 K in most cases, and the TES algorithm shows higher retrieval accuracy with an average LST Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.60 K. With consideration of the comprehensive effects of instrument noise, land surface emissivity, and atmospheric parameter error, the LST retrieval accuracy of SW algorithms remains better than 1.7 K, and that of the TES algorithm is better than 1.5 K under most conditions. The ground validation utilized site data from the Heihe Integrated Observatory Network and the Surface Radiation budget network. The SW and TES algorithms achieved an accuracy of approximately 1.75 and 1.9 K, respectively. Additionally, a cross-validation based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data indicated average RMSDs of approximately 2.25 K for SW algorithms and 3.84 K for TES algorithm. Among the algorithms, the three-channel SW algorithm SW-2 has the best overall performance and is recommended as the LST retrieval method for SDGSAT-1 data.

Wulder;Zhe Zhu;Jan Verbesselt;Dainius Masiliūnas;Yanlan Liu;Gil Bohrer;Yongyang Cai;Yuyu Zhou;Zhaowei Ding;Kaiguang Zhao,DRMAT: A multivariate algorithm for detecting breakpoints in multispectral time series,"•DRMAT is the first multivariate breakpoint detection algorithm in remote sensing. •DRMAT is a generic tool to detect breakpoints in trend and seasonality signals. •The multivariate approach outperforms univariate approaches. •Increasing the number of input bands improves breakpoint detection. •Differentiating breakpoints in trend and seasonality increased the accuracy. 
 Ecosystem dynamics and ecological disturbances manifest as breakpoints in long-term multispectral remote sensing time series. Typically, these breakpoints are captured using univariate methods applied individually to each band, with subsequent integration of the results. However, multivariate analysis provides a promising way to fully incorporate the multispectral bands into breakpoints detection methods, but it has been rarely applied in monitoring ecosystem dynamics and detecting ecological disturbances. In this research, we developed a multivariate algorithm, named breakpoints-Detection algoRithm using MultivAriate Time series (DRMAT). DRMAT can fully use multispectral bands simultaneously with the consideration of the inter-correlation among bands. It decomposes a multivariate time series into trend, seasonality, and noise, iteratively segmenting the detrended/de-seasonalized signals. We quantitatively evaluated DRMAT using both simulated multivariate data and randomly sampled real-world data, including subtle land cover changes caused by forest disturbances (depletions) and recovery (return of vegetation), as well as subtle changes over a broad range of land cover types. We also qualitatively assessed DRMAT in mapping real-world disturbances. For simulated data with prescribed breakpoints in both trend and seasonality, DRMAT detected breakpoints in trend with an F1 score of 85.5 % and in seasonality with an F1 score of 91.7 %. For real-world data in forested land cover, DRMAT unveiled both disturbances and subsequent recovery with an F1 score of 95.1 % for disturbances and 77.1 % for recovery. It detected disturbances in broader land cover types with an F1 score of 84.0 %. We demonstrated that using all-band data was more accurate than using selected bands in breakpoint detection. The inclusion of vegetation indices as model inputs did not improve accuracy unless the original input bands lacked the specific band information in the vegetation indices. As a multivariate approach, DRMAT leverages the full information in the multispectral data and avoids the necessity of integrating results derived from individual bands."

 The acquisition of high-quality reference data is essential for effectively modelling forest attributes. Incorporating close-range Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems into the reference data collection stage of remote sensing-based forest inventories can not only increase data collection efficiency but also increase the number of attributes measured with high quality. Therefore, we propose a model-based forest inventory method that uses reference data collected by a car-mounted mobile laser scanning (MLS) system along boreal forest roads. This approach is used for the estimation of diameter at breast height (DBH) and stem volume at the individual tree-level from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. In addition, we compare the estimates obtained using the proposed method with the ones derived from reference data collected by traditional field inventory of 265 field plots systematically distributed over the study area. The accuracy of the estimates remained comparable regardless of the reference dataset used for estimation of DBH and stem volume. When using the field inventory dataset for model training, the root mean square error (RMSE) of DBH estimates were 4.06 cm (18.8 %) for Norway spruce trees, 6.3 cm (29.6 %) for Scots pine and 8.61 cm (55.9 %) for deciduous trees. Similarly, when evaluating predictions based on the MLS dataset as reference, RMSEs were equal to 3.97 cm (18.4 %) for Norway spruce, 6.12 cm (28.8 %) for Scots pine, and 8.98 cm (58.3 %) for deciduous trees. In general, biases were below 1 cm for most species classes, with the exception of deciduous trees. The accuracy of stem volume also had RMSEs varying across different tree species. For the estimates based on traditional field inventory, the RMSEs were 0.176 m3 (38.8 %) for Norway spruce, 0.228 m3 (52.4 %) for Scots pine and 0.246 m3 (158 %) for deciduous trees. When using the MLS dataset as a reference, the RMSEs were equal to 0.176 m3 (38.8 %), 0.228 m3 (52.4 %), and 0.246 m3 (158 %) for Norway spruce, Scots pine, and deciduous trees, respectively. Car-mounted MLS demonstrated its potential as an efficient alternative for collecting reference data in remote sensing-based forest inventories, which could complement traditional methods."

 The successful launch of the Sentinel-1 satellite in 2014 brought a large amount of free SAR images to researchers and scholars, and its application in the fields of ocean monitoring, land use change, natural disaster monitoring and emergency response is becoming increasingly mature and precise. The main applications of InSAR can be categorized into surface deformation monitoring and DEM generation. Sentinel-1 was initially designed for surface deformation monitoring; thus, there are fewer relevant studies on the use of Sentinel-1 data for DEM extraction. However, as the only SAR satellite whose data are currently free and openly available and whose data are constantly updated, it is highly important to study its sources of error in the DEM generation process and the accuracy of its products. In addition, the SAR data provided by the Sentinel-1 satellite has the advantages of high resolution, all-day, all-weather, providing a large data source for DEM production. Taking the Ankang area as an example, this paper analyzes the influence of the InSAR spatiotemporal baseline, ground cover, terrain factors, SAR imaging and other factors on the accuracy of the Sentinel-1-extracted DEM using multisource ground observation data to validate its feasibility for terrain mapping in complex terrain. Finally, we look forward to how to effectively improve the quality of Sentinel-1 DEM products to provide guidance and a reference for subsequent research on DEM extraction using Sentinel-1 SAR images and designation of Sentinel-1 C satellite’s parameters."

Nelson;Kenneth Bundy;Kevaughn. Smith;Matt. Macander;Catherine Chan,Predicting plants in the wild: Mapping arctic and boreal plants with UAS-based visible and near infrared reflectance spectra,"•Spectra from six plant functional type statistically differed across types. •Vegetation indices besides NDVI were the best predictors of plant functional type. •Five narrow regions between 400 and 1000 nm composed important vegetation indices. •Weak learners outperformed complex models by balancing sampling bias and variance. •Imagery with 4 cm GSD still included many mixtures of tundra and boreal plants. 
 Biophysical changes in the Arctic and boreal zones drive shifts in vegetation, such as increasing shrub cover from warming soil or loss of living mat species due to fire. Understanding current and future responses to these factors requires mapping vegetation at a fine taxonomic resolution and landscape scale. Plants vary in size and spectral signatures, which hampers mapping of meaningful functional groups at coarse spatial resolution. Fine spatial grain of remotely sensed data (<10  cm pixels) is often necessary to resolve patches of many Arctic and boreal plant groups, such as bryophytes and lichens, which are significant components of terrestrial vegetation cover. Separation of co-occurring small vegetation patches in images also requires high spectral resolution. Our goal here was to test the capabilities of UAS-based imaging spectroscopy for mapping plant functional types (PFT) using high spatial and spectral resolution data over Arctic and boreal vegetation at four sites in central Alaska. We then tested several Machine and Deep learning models of PFT cover using the reflectance spectra. The best models were very simple, balancing both bias (overfitting caused by imbalance sample sizes) and variance (fit to the independent validation data), explaining > 50 % of the independent ground cover estimation and > 84 % accuracy in estimating validation pixels. We explored the impact of spectral resolution on PFT mapping by including vegetation indices and a gradient of narrow (5 nm) to wide (50 nm) band features in our classification models across. Vegetation indices were the most important predictors for classifying PFTs, while including band features improved models, with narrow and wide bandwidths having similar importance but models with wide bandwidths performing slightly better. We conclude that Arctic and boreal PFT reflectance can be pooled across sites for mapping with relatively few labeled pixels. Underfit, simple algorithms outperformed deep learning, at least with these small sample sizes, in classifying PFTs by balancing bias and variance. Future work should aim to increase the number of labeled pixels and the detail of labels to further improve mapping taxonomic precision."

We assessed the classical hallmarks of aging in parents at three age classes (young, middle-aged, and old) and crossbred them using a split-brood design to examine the consequences of the nine maternal-by-paternal age combinations on their offspring. Reproductive aging leads to increased larval mortality and accelerated telomere shortening in spats, rendering them more susceptible to infection by the Ostreid herpesvirus. Viral exposure stimulates telomerase activity, a response that we identified as adaptive, but weakened by parental aging. While telomerase lengthens a spat’s telomere, paradoxically, longer individual TL predicts higher mortality in adults.

Simulated gross primary productivity increases from 0.52 ± 0.02 Pg[C] yr−1 in the 1990s to 0.57 ± 0.01 Pg[C] yr−1 in the 2010s with the major contribution by CO2 fertilization effect. The regional carbon sink, measured as net biospheric productivity (NBP), peaks at 0.03 Pg[C] yr−1 in the 2000s but remains stable or slightly decreases in the 2010s depending on the LCC datasets. Forests act as the main contributors to the enhancement of the regional carbon sink, with negative contributions from the loss of shrubland and grassland. The stable NBP during 2000–2019 suggests a potential slowdown in the efficacy of carbon sink as forests mature. While forest expansion significantly promotes NBP, the carbon released during the replacement of other vegetation types suggests that afforestation efforts need to be complemented with associated supportive measures to prevent newly forested areas from becoming net carbon sources."

An analysis of 528 fecal samples showed a significantly higher intake of ingredients from human food in residential districts (χ2 = 4.691, P = 0.026), which indicates that urban raccoon dog foraging strategies differ from the forest park population due to the presence of discarded human food, cat food, and wet garbage in residential districts. Based on our findings, we propose a community-based wildlife management strategy and suggest modifying the current design of residential districts. Our results underscore the importance of mammal behavior studies in urban biodiversity management and provide a scientific basis for mitigating human–wildlife conflicts in urban environments in and beyond our study area."

Using a particle trajectory model, we found the combined influence of mesoscale eddies and NIOs could produce distinctive flower-like trajectories, which are a special case of near-inertial trajectories and were observed by surface drifters released within an anticyclone eddy in the South China Sea in 2021. The energy budget indicates that wind and geostrophic eddy currents are crucial in generating near-inertial energy during the flower-like trajectories. Furthermore, the particle trajectory model revealed variations in periods and widths of the near-inertial trajectory with latitudes. The width of near-inertial trajectories can exceed 8 km in the near-equatorial region and reach 3–6 km in the mid-latitude region (20°–50°). The ratios of near-inertial velocity to background velocity, defined as near-inertial trajectory shape index (NITSIs), lead to arc-shaped (0.5 < NITSI < 1.0), overlapping semi-circular (NITSI > 1.0), and near-circular trajectories (NITSI ≫ 1.0). Globally, approximately 1/3 of the drifters’ lifespan featured clear near-inertial trajectories, with a significant presence in most middle latitudes and the largest NITSI in the north Pacific westerly. These findings highlight the importance of NIOs and suggest their substantial impact on local surface matter distribution, trajectory prediction, and marine rescue operations."

To understand how this affects the hydrology and ecosystems of the affected regions, it is important to measure glacier mass balance and ensure that records of field surveys are kept in standardized formats and well-documented. We describe glaciological measurements of ice ablation and snow accumulation gathered at Mullwitzkees and Venedigerkees, two glaciers in the Austrian Alps, since 2007 and 2012, respectively. 
 Glaciers in the Alps are losing mass at unprecedented and accelerating rates. Monitoring of glacier mass change as well as relevant atmospheric parameters plays an important role in improving understanding of local and downstream impacts. We present sub-seasonal, seasonal, and annual glaciological mass balance data and meteorological observations from Mullwitzkees and Venedigerkees, two glacier monitoring sites in the Hohe Tauern range of the Austrian Alps. Ablation stake networks were established on Mullwitzkees in 2006/07 and on Venedigerkees in 2011/12. Monitoring is ongoing. In addition to stake readings at sub-seasonal intervals, accumulation measurements (snow pits and probing) are carried out seasonally. The glaciological dataset consists of sub-seasonal floating-date measurements as well as fixed-date seasonal and annual values. The fixed-date glacier-wide mass balance was derived from annual point mass balance values. Automatic weather stations measuring standard meteorological parameters were installed near Mullwitzkees and Venedigerkees in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Meteorological data are provided in 10 min intervals. Uncertainties in individual point mass balance measurements were computed following the approach of the Swiss Glacier Monitoring (GLAMOS) programme, taking into account estimated density and reading errors. The sub-seasonal mass balance records highlight shorter-term variability in mass loss and the linkage with meteorological conditions. The most negative annual point mass balance recorded in the period of record was −5.8 ± 0.66 m w.e. at an elevation of 2536 m on Venedigerkees, and 2022 stands out as the most negative mass balance year to date in both time series, particularly at higher elevations. The cumulative specific mass balances (glacier-wide) over the period of record were −14.68 m w.e. at Mullwitzkees and −8.79 m w.e. at Venedigerkees. Data are available in the PANGAEA publication series and the associated datasets. The main publication series are updated annually.

Our experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in developing environmental models and maps. Tailored feature selection is crucial for its effective use in environmental modeling. It aims to support comprehensive environmental monitoring and analysis, helping researchers and policymakers in managing environmental resources. 
 The production and evaluation of the Analysis Ready and Cloud Optimized (ARCO) data cube for continental Europe (including Ukraine, the UK, and Turkey), derived from the Landsat Analysis Ready Data version 2 (ARD V2) produced by Global Land Analysis and Discovery team (GLAD) and covering the period from 2000 to 2022 is described. The data cube consists of 17TB of data at a 30–meter resolution and includes bimonthly, annual, and long-term spectral indices on various thematic topics, including: surface reflectance bands, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI), minimum Normalized Difference Tillage Index (minNDTI), Bare Soil Fraction (BSF), Number of Seasons (NOS), and Crop Duration Ratio (CDR). The data cube was developed with the intention of providing a comprehensive feature space for environmental modeling and soil, vegetation, and land cover mapping. To evaluate its effectiveness for this purpose, the quality of the produced time series was assessed by: (1) visual examination for artifacts and inconsistencies, (2) plausibility checks with ground survey data, and (3) predictive modeling tests, examples with soil organic carbon (SOC) and land cover (LC) classification. The results of visual examination indicate that the gap-filled product is complete and consistent, except for winter periods in northern latitudes and high-altitude areas where high cloud and snow density make gap-filling complex, and hence many artifacts remain. The plausibility results further show that the indices effectively help differentiate landscapes and crop types: the BSF index showed a strong negative correlation (-0.73) with crop coverage data, effectively detecting soil exposure. The minNDTI index had a moderate positive correlation (0.57) with the Eurostat tillage practices survey data, indicating valuable information on the intensity of the tillage. The detailed temporal resolution and long-term characteristics provided by different tiers of predictors in this data cube proved to be important for both soil organic carbon regression and LC classification experiments based on the 60,723 LUCAS observations: long-term characteristics (tier 4) were particularly valuable for predictive mapping of SOC and LC coming on the top of variable importance assessment. Crop-specific indices (NOS and CDR) provided limited value for the tested applications, possibly due to noise or insufficient quantification methods.

The environmental inputs are rarely noiseless, which causes problems when calibrating multi-input PSMs. Here a PSM is developed which includes generalized noise in both model inputs and outputs and prior information. A quasi-Bayesian method enhances the stability of the solution of the Measurement Error Proxy System Model. 
 Proxy system models (PSMs) are an essential component of paleoclimate data assimilation and for testing climate field reconstruction methods. Generally, current statistical PSMs consider the noise in the output (proxy) variable only and ignore the noise in the input (environmental) variables. This problem is exacerbated when there are several input variables.  Here we develop a new PSM, the Measurement Error Proxy System Model (MEPSM), which includes noise in all variables, including noise auto- and cross-correlation. The MEPSM is calibrated using a quasi-Bayesian solution, which leverages Gaussian conjugacy to produce a fast solution.  Another advantage of MEPSM is that the prior can be used to stabilize the solution between an informative prior (e.g., with a non-zero mean) and the maximum likelihood solution. MEPSM is illustrated by calibrating a proxy model for δ18Ocoral with multiple inputs (marine temperature and salinity), including noise in all variables. MEPSM is applicable to many different climate proxies and will improve our understanding of the effects of predictor noise on PSMs, data assimilation, and climate reconstruction."

Electro-coalescence is when oppositely charged droplets stick together. We introduce an analytical expression of electro-coalescence probability and use it in a warm-cumulus-cloud simulation. Results show that charge cases increase rain and droplet size, with the new method outperforming older ones. The new method requires longer computation time, but its impact on rain justifies inclusion in meteorology models. 
 The phenomenon of electric fields applied to droplets, inducing droplet coalescence, is called the electro-coalescence effect. An analytic expression for electro-coalescence with the accurate electrostatic force for a pair of droplets with opposite-sign charges is established by treating the droplets as conducting spheres (CSs). To investigate this effect, we applied a weak electric field to a cumulus cloud using a cloud model that employs the super-droplet method, a probabilistic particle-based microphysics method. This study employs a two-dimensional (2D) large-eddy simulation (LES) in a flow-coupled model to examine aerosol microphysics (such as collision–coalescence enhancement, velocity fluctuations, and supersaturation fluctuations) in warm cumulus clouds without relying on subgrid dynamics. In the simulation, we assume that droplets carry opposite-sign charges and are well mixed within the cloud. The charge is not treated as an individual particle attribute. To assess fluctuation effects, we conducted 50 simulations with varying pseudo-random number sequences for each electro-coalescence treatment. The results show that, with CS treatment, the electrostatic force contributes a larger effect on cloud evolution than in previous research. With a lower charge limit of the maximum charge amount on the droplet, the domain total precipitation with CS treatment for droplets with opposite signs is higher than that with the no-charge (NC) setting. Compared to previous work, the multi-image dipole treatment of CS results in higher precipitation. It is found that the electro-coalescence effect could affect rain formation even when the droplet charge is at the lower charge limit. High pollution levels result in greater sensitivity to electro-coalescence. The results show that, when the charge ratio between two droplets is over 100, the short-range attractive electric force due to the multi-image dipole would also significantly enhance precipitation for the cumulus. It is indicated that, although the accurate treatment of the electrostatic force with the CS method would require 30 % longer computation time than before, it is worthwhile to include it in cloud, weather, and climate models."

It solves equations that describe the dynamics and the growth and melt of sea ice. To do so, the domain is divided into grid cells and variables are positioned at specific locations in the cells. A new implementation (C-grid) is presented, with the velocity located on cell edges. Compared to the previous B-grid, the C-grid allows for a natural coupling with some oceanic and atmospheric models. It also allows for ice transport in narrow channels. 
 This article presents the C-grid implementation of the CICE sea ice model, including the C-grid discretization of the momentum equation, the boundary conditions (BCs), and the modifications to the code required to use the incremental remapping transport scheme. To validate the new C-grid implementation, many numerical experiments were conducted and compared to the B-grid solutions. In idealized experiments, the standard advection method (incremental remapping with C-grid velocities interpolated to the cell corners) leads to a checkerboard pattern. A modal analysis demonstrates that this computational noise originates from the spatial averaging of C-grid velocities at corners. The checkerboard pattern can be eliminated by adjusting the departure regions to match the divergence obtained from the solution of the momentum equation. We refer to this novel approach as the edge flux adjustment (EFA) method. The C-grid discretization with edge flux adjustment allows for transport in channels that are one grid cell wide – a capability that is not possible with the B-grid discretization nor with the C-grid and standard remapping advection. Simulation results match the predicted values of a novel analytical solution for one-grid-cell-wide channels."

 openAMUNDSEN (the open source version of the Alpine MUltiscale Numerical Distributed Simulation ENgine) is a fully distributed snow-hydrological model, designed primarily for calculating the seasonal evolution of snow cover and melt rates in mountain regions. It resolves the mass and energy balance of snow-covered surfaces and layers of the snowpack, thereby including the most important processes that are relevant in complex mountain topography. The potential model applications are very versatile; typically, it is applied in areas ranging from the point scale to the regional scale (i.e., up to some thousands of square kilometers) using a spatial resolution of 10–1000 m and a temporal resolution of 1–3 h or daily. Temporal horizons may vary between single events and climate change scenarios. The openAMUNDSEN model has already been used for many applications, which are referenced herein. It features a spatial interpolation of meteorological observations, several layers of snow with different density and liquid-water contents, wind-induced lateral redistributions, snow–canopy interactions, glacier ice responses to climate, and more. The model can be configured according to each specific application case. A basic consideration for its development was to include a variety of process descriptions of different complexity to set up individual model runs which best match a compromise between physical detail, transferability, simplicity, and computational performance for a certain region in the European Alps, typically a (preferably gauged) hydrological catchment.

Comparisons with observations reveal that the model accurately represents carbon fluxes and stocks. Despite the underestimations in certain land-use conversions, the model describes general trends in soil carbon response to land-use change, aligning with the site observations. 
 Land-use change (LUC) impacts biospheric carbon, encompassing biomass carbon and soil organic carbon (SOC). Despite the use of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) in estimating the anthropogenic perturbation of biospheric carbon stocks, critical evaluations of model performance concerning LUC impacts are scarce. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of the performance of the DGVM Organising Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) in reproducing observed LUC impacts on biospheric carbon stocks over Europe. First, we compare model predictions with observation-based gridded estimates of net and gross primary productivity (NPP and GPP), biomass growth patterns, and SOC stocks. Second, we evaluate the predicted response of soil carbon stocks to LUC based on data from forest inventories, paired plots, chronosequences, and repeated sampling designs. Third, we use interpretable machine learning to identify factors contributing to discrepancies between simulations and observations, including drivers and processes not resolved in ORCHIDEE (e.g. erosion, soil fertility). Results indicate agreement between the model and observed spatial patterns and temporal trends, such as the increase in biomass with age, when simulating biosphere carbon stocks. The direction of the SOC responses to LUC generally aligns between simulated and observed data. However, the model underestimates carbon gains for cropland-to-grassland conversions and carbon losses for grassland-to-cropland and forest-to-cropland conversions. These discrepancies are attributed to bias arising from soil erosion rate, which is not fully captured in ORCHIDEE. Our study provides an oriented benchmark for assessing the DGVMs against observations and explores their potential in studying the impact of LUCs on SOC stocks."

Adapting GHMs to ungauged basins requires regionalization, enabling valid simulations. In this study, we highlight the impact of regionalization of GHMs on runoff simulations using an ensemble of regionalization methods for WaterGAP3. We have found that regionalization leads to temporally and spatially varying uncertainty, potentially reaching up to inter-model differences. 
 Valid simulation results from global hydrological models (GHMs), such as WaterGAP3, are essential for detecting hotspots or studying patterns in climate change impacts. However, the lack of worldwide monitoring data makes it challenging to adapt GHM parameters to enable such valid simulations globally. Therefore, regionalization is necessary to estimate parameters in ungauged basins. This study presents the results of regionalization methods for the first time applied to the GHM WaterGAP3. It aims to provide insights into (1) selecting a suitable regionalization method for a GHM and (2) evaluating its impact on runoff simulation. In this study, four new regionalization methods have been identified as appropriate for WaterGAP3. These methods span the full spectrum of methodologies, i.e., regression-based methods, physical similarity, and spatial proximity, using traditional and machine-learning-based approaches. Moreover, the methods differ in the descriptors used to achieve optimal results, although all utilize climatic and physiographic descriptors. This demonstrates (1) that different methods use descriptor sets with varying efficiency and (2) that combining climatic and physiographic descriptors is optimal for regionalizing worldwide basins. Additionally, our research indicates that regionalization leads to spatially and temporally varying uncertainty in ungauged regions. For example, regionalization highly affects southern South America, leading to high uncertainties in the flood simulation of the Río Deseado. The local impact of regionalization propagates through the water system, also affecting global estimates, as evidenced by a spread of 1500 km3 yr−1 across an ensemble of five regionalization methods in simulated global runoff to the ocean. This discrepancy is even more pronounced when using a regionalization method deemed unsuitable for WaterGAP3, resulting in a spread of 4208 km3 yr−1. This significant increase highlights the importance of carefully choosing regionalization methods. Further research is needed to enhance the predictor selection and the understanding of the robustness of the methods on a global scale."

This shows that in the absence of Fe2+, HS– rapidly adsorbed onto nZVI particles and reacted with surface iron oxide to form mackinawite and greigite (<0.5 h). As nZVI corrosion progressed, amorphous FeSx in solution deposited on nZVI, forming S-nZVI (0.5–24 h). However, in the initial presence of Fe2+, the rapid reaction between HS– and Fe2+ produced amorphous FeSx, which deposited on the nZVI and corroded the surface iron oxide layer (<0.25 h). This was followed by redeposition of colloidal iron (hydr)oxide on the particle surface (0.25–8 h) and deposition of residual FeSx (8–24 h) on S-nZVI. S loading on S-nZVI was 1 order of magnitude higher when Fe2+ was present.

As TCS is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, many previous studies have documented the effects of exposure to TCS on aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, most of the research has concentrated on the molecular and physiological responses of TCS, but there are still limited studies on the function of specific genes and the consequences of their absence. In this study, we focused on p53, a gene that is crucial for molecular responses such as autophagy and apoptosis as a result of TCS exposure. In order to ascertain the role and impact of the p53 gene in TCS-induced molecular responses, we examined the molecular responses to TCS-induced oxidative stress in wild-type (WT) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated p53 mutant (MT) water fleas. The result has been accomplished by examining changes in molecular mechanisms, including in vivo end points, enzyme activities, adenosine triphosphate release rate, and apoptosis, to determine the role and impact of the p53 gene on TCS-induced molecular responses. The results indicated that the sensitivity of MT water fleas to TCS was greater than that of WT water fleas; however, the difference in sensitivity was significant at short exposures within 48 h and decreased toward 48 h. Accordingly, when we confirmed the oxidative stress after 24 h of exposure, the oxidative stress to TCS exposure was stronger in the MT group, with an imbalance of redox. To identify the mechanisms of tolerance to TCS in WT and MT Daphnia magna, we checked mitochondrial and ER-stress-related biomarkers and found an increase in apoptosis and greater sensitivity to TCS exposure in the MT group than in the WT. Our results suggest that the absence of p53 caused alterations in molecular processes in response to TCS exposure, resulting in increased sensitivity to TCS, and that p53 plays a critical role in response to TCS exposure."

However, their combined toxicity with arsenic remains poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the combined mitochondrial genotoxicity of CDs and arsenate at environmentally relevant concentrations across successive earthworm generations. Iron-doped CDs (CDs–Fe) strongly bound to arsenate and arsenite, while nitrogen-doped CDs (CDs–N) exhibited weaker binding. Both CDs enhanced arsenate bioaccumulation without affecting its biotransformation, with most arsenate being reduced to arsenite. CDs–Fe generated significantly more reactive oxygen species than did CDs–N, causing stronger mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. Arsenate further exacerbated the oxidative mtDNA damage induced by CDs–N, as evidenced by increased reactive oxygen species, elevated 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, and a higher correlation between 8-OHdG and mtDNA damage. This was due to arsenic inhibiting the antioxidant enzyme catalase. This exacerbation was negligible with CDs–Fe because their strong binding with arsenic prevented catalase inhibition. Maternal mitochondrial DNA damage was inherited by filial earthworms, which experienced significant weight loss in coexposure groups coupled with mtDNA toxicity. This study reveals the synergistic genotoxicity of CDs and arsenate, suggesting that CDs could disrupt the arsenic biogeochemical cycle, increase arsenate risk to terrestrial animals, and influence ecosystem stability and health through multigenerational impacts."

Copper (Cu) overexposure has been found to be linked to many diseases during aging, particularly neurodegenerative diseases. Meanwhile, as an essential element, Cu has been implicated in key processes associated with aging, raising questions about its role in age-related health issues. This study delves into the mechanisms behind the copper imbalance during aging. By analyzing blood copper concentrations of healthy individuals (including data from healthy subjects (26 ≤ age ≤ 90, n = 62) and publicly available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (18 ≤ age < 80, n = 1624)) and employing C57BL/6N male mice models (n = 22), we reveal a consistent age-related increase in copper levels, particularly in plasma. Utilizing stable copper isotopic analysis, copper-associated protein analysis, and metabolomic analysis, we trace the sources of Cu imbalance associated with aging. Our findings reveal that aged mice had a higher copper concentrations and an enrichment of light copper isotope (63Cu) in plasma compared to controls. Additionally, copper reductases and copper transporters are upregulated in the intestine tract, associated with the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways. We suggest that aged mice have an abnormally high copper intake requirement, probably due to deregulated nutrient sensing, leading to increased expression levels of copper reductases and copper transporters for extra copper absorption in the intestines. This research provides a copper-centric perspective on the connection between deregulated nutrient sensing and aging, thus shedding light on the aspect of aging and copper overexposure."

Complex relations between topographic and environmental attributes characterizing landslide susceptibility at local scales are not transferrable across areas without landslide data. Existing maps with multiple susceptibility classifications under‐represent landslide potential in moderate and gently sloping terrain. We leverage an extensive landslide database (N = 613,724), a high‐resolution digital elevation model (10‐m), and high‐performance computing resources, to develop a new nationwide susceptibility map for the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. We calculate four alternative linear and nonlinear thresholds of topographic slope and relief using an objective split‐sample calibration. We down‐sample our results to a 90‐m grid to account for uncertainty in the digital elevation model and landslide position, and evaluate these thresholds' ability to differentiate areas of greater susceptibility. The less conservative nonlinear model optimally balances our priorities of capturing observed landslides (99%) while minimizing area covered by susceptible terrain (43%). Independent evaluation with four statewide landslide inventories (N = 172,367) reinforces our model selection but highlights spatially variable performance. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to susceptibility classification using the concentration of landslide‐prone terrain within each down‐sampled grid. While landslides are possible within any cells containing susceptible terrain, those with the highest concentration capture the majority of observed landslides. Our new map characterizes landside susceptibility more consistently than prior models; our transparent classification approach also provides flexibility for accommodating different tolerances in risk reduction measures."

The air gap with around 3–5 m has been bridged between the wire's lower extremity and the metal blade tip during ascending of the rocket and it is observed to be luminous by slow framing rate camera. The precursors are classified into three groups, namely bipolar pulses, unipolar pulses, and group pulses. Excluding the precursors preceding the initial stage and M‐components at the late‐time of the initial stage, five stages are classified. In the first stage, the current remains limited at a relatively small value, while the electric field exhibited a slow rising behavior with positive polarity. In the second stage, the current starts to increase, and the electric field rapidly intensifies due to the accumulating charge, and the wire is assumed to experience an explosion. In the third stage, the reconnection process occurs. The current is characterized by a peak value of 1.45 kA with 10%–90% risetime of 10.4 μs.

Okubo‐Weiss parameter analysis reveals a distinctive meridional pattern of cyclonic and anticyclonic SE distribution in the interior western Pacific basin that aligns with zonally elongated mean flows. These westward‐propagating SEs play a pivotal role in regulating the formation of zonal undercurrents, particularly off‐equatorial regions, through the convergence of eddy potential vorticity flux. Along the Pacific western boundary region, anticyclonic SEs typically enhance (reverse) the velocity of boundary currents flowing northward (southward), primarily through barotropic energy conversion, while cyclonic SEs do the opposite. To summarize, we provide a schematic map of the circulation system in the western Pacific and emphasize the interconnected framework of undercurrents, particularly in relation to SEs."

However, the effect of seamounts on the air‐sea CO2 flux has not yet been well studied. In September 2021, the air‐sea CO2 flux was measured directly using eddy covariance (EC), and discrete waterside sampling was conducted. The results indicate that the northern South China Sea is a source of atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, EC measurements show that the seamount emits CO2 at an average rate of 0.34 mmol m−2 hr−1, nearly double that of non‐seamount areas. We suggest that the upwelling around the seamount transports deep water rich in dissolved inorganic carbon to the upper ocean, increasing the partial pressure of CO2 there.

We investigate seismicity from Paradox Valley, Colorado as an ideal test case: a single, high‐pressure injector that has induced thousands of earthquakes since 1991. Using feature importance analysis, we find that injection‐driven earthquakes are approximately 22± $\pm $5% of the total catalog but act as background events that can trigger subsequent aftershocks. Injection‐driven events also have distinct spatiotemporal clustering properties with a larger b‐value, closer proximity to the well, and earlier occurrence in the injection history.

Here, with their new assembly-based genotyper (NAHRwhals), the authors verify multi-step SVs in 37 human loci and identify alleles at risk for copy-number variation. 
 Modern sequencing technology enables the systematic detection of complex structural variation (SV) across genomes. However, extensive DNA rearrangements arising through a series of mutations, a phenomenon we refer to as serial SV (sSV), remain underexplored, posing a challenge for SV discovery. Here, we present NAHRwhals (

              ), a method to infer repeat-mediated series of SVs in long-read genomic assemblies. Applying NAHRwhals to haplotype-resolved human genomes from 28 individuals reveals 37 sSV loci of various length and complexity. These sSVs explain otherwise cryptic variation in medically relevant regions such as the TPSAB1 gene, 8p23.1, 22q11 and Sotos syndrome regions. Comparisons with great ape assemblies indicate that most human sSVs formed recently, after the human-ape split, and involved non-repeat-mediated processes in addition to non-allelic homologous recombination. NAHRwhals reliably discovers and characterizes sSVs at scale and independent of species, uncovering their genomic abundance and suggesting broader implications for disease. Structural variants (SV) can accumulate in repeat-rich parts of the genome and transform them in unexpected ways.

Based on a carbon isotope budget, this study infers that at the LGM biological production pumped carbon into the deep ocean and sea ice kept it there. 
 Understanding the causes of the  ~90 ppmv atmospheric CO2 swings between glacial and interglacial climates is an important open challenge in paleoclimate research. Although the regularity of the glacial-interglacial cycles hints at a single driving mechanism, Earth System models require many independent physical and biological processes to explain the full observed CO2 signal. Here we show that biologically sequestered carbon in the ocean can explain an atmospheric CO2 change of 75 ± 40 ppmv, based on a mass balance calculation using published carbon isotopic measurements. An analysis of the carbon isotopic signatures of different water masses indicates similar regenerated carbon inventories at the Last Glacial Maximum and during the Holocene, requiring that the change in carbon storage was dominated by disequilibrium. We attribute the inferred change in carbon disequilibrium to expansion of sea-ice or change in the overturning circulation.

Here, the authors detect genetic associations with thyroid related traits in pregnant women. 
 Maintaining normal thyroid function is crucial in pregnancy, yet thyroid dysfunction and the presence of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) affect 0.5% to 18% of pregnant women. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of eight thyroid traits, including two thyroid-related hormones, four thyroid dysfunctions, and two thyroid autoimmunity measurements among 85,421 Chinese pregnant women to investigate the genetic basis of thyroid function during pregnancy. Our study identified 176 genetic loci, including 125 previously unknown genome-wide associations. Joint epidemiological and Mendelian randomization analyses revealed significant associations between the gestational thyroid phenotypes and gestational complications, birth outcomes, and later-age health outcomes. Specifically, genetically elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels during pregnancy correlated with lower glycemic levels, reduced blood pressure, and longer gestational duration. Additionally, TPOAb and thyroid functions during pregnancy share genetic correlations with later-age thyroid and cardiac disorders. These findings provide insights into the genetic determinants of thyroid traits during pregnancy, which may lead to new therapeutics, early pre-diagnosis and preventive strategies starting from early adulthood.

 We discover an intrinsic dipole Hall effect in a variety of magnetic insulating states at integer fillings of twisted MoTe2 moiré superlattice, including topologically trivial and nontrivial ferro-, antiferro-, and ferri-magnetic configurations. The dipole Hall current, in linear response to in-plane electric field, generates an in-plane orbital magnetization M∥ along the field, through which an AC field can drive magnetization oscillation up to THz range. Upon the continuous topological phase transitions from trivial to quantum anomalous Hall states in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations, the dipole Hall current and M∥ have an abrupt sign change, enabling contact-free detection of the transitions through the magnetic stray field. In configurations where the linear response is forbidden by symmetry, the dipole Hall current and M∥ appear as a crossed nonlinear response to both in-plane and out-of-plane electric fields. These magnetoelectric phenomena showcase fascinating functionalities of insulators from the interplay between magnetism, topology, and electrical polarization.

Here, authors apply semiconductor fluid molecular plasticizers to improve stretchable deformability, achieving high performance flexible polymer light-emitting diodes. 
 Fully π-conjugated polymers with rigid aromatic units are promising for flexible optoelectronic devices, but their inherent brittleness poses a challenge for achieving high-performance, intrinsically stretchable fully π-conjugated polymer. Here, we are establishing an external-plasticizing strategy using semiconductor fluid plasticizers (Z1 and Z2) to enhance the optoelectronic, morphological, and stretchable properties of fully π-conjugated polymer films for flexible light-emitting diodes. The synergistic effect of hierarchical structure and optoelectronic properties of Z1 in poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) films enable excellent stretchable deformability (~25%) and good conductivity. PLEDs based on F8BT/Z1 films show stable electroluminescence and efficiency under 15% stretch and 100 cycles at 10% strain, revealing outstanding stress tolerance. This strategy is also improving the stretchable properties of polymers like poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO) and poly(2-methoxy-5(2′-ethyl)hexoxy-phenylenevinylene) (Super Yellow), demonstrating its general applicability. Therefore, this strategy can provide effective guidance for designing high-performance stretchable fully π-conjugated polymers films for flexible electronic devices.

 The use of monoclonal antibodies for the control of drug resistant nosocomial bacteria may alleviate a reliance on broad spectrum antimicrobials for treatment of infection. We identify monoclonal antibodies that may prevent infection caused by carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. We use human immune repertoire mice (Kymouse platform mice) as a surrogate for human B cell interrogation to establish an unbiased strategy to probe the antibody-accessible target landscape of clinically relevant A. baumannii. After immunisation of the Kymouse platform mice with A. baumannii derived outer membrane vesicles (OMV) we identify 297 antibodies and analyse 26 of these for functional potential. These antibodies target lipooligosaccharide (OCL1), the Oxa-23 protein, and the KL49 capsular polysaccharide. We identify a single monoclonal antibody (mAb1416) recognising KL49 capsular polysaccharide to demonstrate prophylactic in vivo protection against a carbapenem resistant A. baumannii lineage associated with neonatal sepsis mortality in Asia. Our end-to-end approach identifies functional monoclonal antibodies with prophylactic potential against major lineages of drug resistant bacteria accounting for phylogenetic diversity and clinical relevance without existing knowledge of a specific target antigen. Such an approach might be scaled for a additional clinically important bacterial pathogens in the post-antimicrobial era.

 Lithium is key for a clean energy transition but faces sustainability challenges in the global supply.

 The Tibetan Plateau and surroundings, commonly referred to as the Third Pole region, has the largest ice store outside the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Glacial lakes in the Third Pole region are expanding rapidly as glaciers thin and retreat. The Landsat satellite series is the most popular for mapping glacial lakes, benefiting from long-term archived data and suitable spatial resolution (30 m since ∼1990). However, the homogeneous mapping of high-quality, large-scale, and multi-temporal glacial lake inventories using Landsat imagery relies heavily on visual inspection and manual editing due to mountain shadows, wet ice, frozen lakes, and snow cover on lake boundaries, which is time consuming and labour-intensive. Deep learning methods have been applied to glacial lake extraction in the Third Pole and other regions, yet these methods are either concentrated on small test sites without large-scale applications or in polar regions. In this study, several classical deep convolutional neural networks were evaluated, and the DeepLabv3+ with Mobilenetv3 backbone performed best, with a high accuracy of mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 94.8 % and a low loss error of 0.4 %. The proposed method demonstrated robustness in challenging conditions such as mountain shadows, frozen or partially frozen lakes, wet ice and river contact, all without requiring extensive manual correction. Compared with manual delineation, the model's prediction has a precision rate of 86 %, recall rate of 85 %, and F1-score of 85 %. The area extracted by the model shows a strong correlation with the manual delineation (r2 = 0.97, slope = 0.94) and a high intersection over union (IoU > 0.8) of the predicted areas. A test of large-scale glacial lake mapping based on the developed automated model in 2020 across the Third Pole region shows the robust performance with 29,429 glacial lakes larger than 0.0054 km2 with a total area of ∼1779.9 km2 (including non-glacier-fed lakes).

 This paper presents a novel approach to tracking ships in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images based on an improved lightweight YOLOv8 Nano (YOLOv8n), specially devised to improve efficiency without compromising accuracy. In our method, we replaced the heavy backbone and neck of YOLOv8 with HGNetv2 and slim-neck, respectively. We also implemented a lightweight decoupling head using EMSConvP. Additionally, we integrated a knowledge distillation module to further enhance detection capabilities. Furthermore, we conducted extensive experiments on the short-time sequence SAR dataset to demonstrate superior accuracy metrics compared to the original YOLOv8n model. Regarding tracking ships in SAR images, we developed a multi-object tracking (MOT) technique called Cascaded-Buffered IoU (C-BIoU). This method enlarges the detection and trajectory matching space by increasing the buffer zone, effectively combining detection and trajectory information from short-time sequence SAR images. The findings reveal that our method significantly reduces the computational complexity, parameters, and model size by up to 54.7 %, 68.4 %, and 68.3 %, respectively, with respect to the original model metrics. As a direct consequence of these reductions, our proposed model demonstrates a remarkable 133.1 % improvement in image processing speed expressed as frames per second (FPS). Moreover, Our C-BIoU method shows outstanding performance in tracking accuracy and efficiency, with superior Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA), Multiple Object Tracking Precision (MOTP), and Identification F1 score (IDF1) scores of 72.8 %, 87.9 %, and 80.7 %, respectively, compared to existing tracking algorithms.

 Penguins play an essential biochemical role in the Antarctic ecosystem, being the study of their dynamics of utmost importance to understand their environment, behaviour and populational trends in the current climate change scenario. In this study, we used multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) along the coast of the chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) colony of Vapour Col (Deception Island, Antarctica) to map potential sites of biochemical interactions with the surrounding sea water. Several runoff discharge points were identified, where a precise placing of environmental sampling station is suggested. Additionally, UAVs were used in combination with Object Detection Architectures to obtain the chinstrap colony population size. Applying a simulation for clutch initiation dates due to our off-laying peak count, we obtained an estimated range of 13,250 to 22,000 breeding pairs in the 2021/2022 breeding season, also suggesting an alternative approach using chinstrap chicks as proxy to estimate adult numbers. This research shows the utility of UAV-deep learning for environment characterization and wildlife monitoring, providing a solid framework for upcoming studies in the area."

Fahad Hasan,Combining earth observations with ground data to assess river topography and morphologic change: Case study of the lower Jamuna River,"•The waterline method derived river-floodplain topography for the Lower Jamuna River. •Geomorphic change was assessed using DEMs of difference. •Reach-scale erosion and accretion have similar magnitudes to the sediment influx. •Error propagation provides insight into data and methodological uncertainties. 
 The Jamuna is a major braided river of Bangladesh and poses enormous challenges related to flooding, erosion, and sedimentation. Effective river management requires an understanding of the Jamuna’s sediment transport dynamics and channel morphology. Yet, developing that understanding is hindered by a lack of topographic data for the river corridor. In this study, the waterline method was applied to a 65 km reach of the Jamuna to derive river channel and floodplain topography above the low water level. The analysis relies on surface water detection from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, along with in-situ water level observations, to generate river-floodplain DEMs for the years 2016–2019. Morphologic change was assessed through DEMs of difference for sequential years and for the overall study period. A quantitative uncertainty analysis was conducted to characterize errors in the waterline DEMs, vertical change detection, and gross and net volumetric changes. The results indicate that gross annual erosion and accretion volumes have a similar order of magnitude to contemporary estimates of the river’s sediment influx. The study highlights that localized and reach-scale lateral exchange is a key component of the overall sediment budget. Finally, the uncertainty analysis framework provides insight and recommendations for how errors can be assessed and reduced in future waterline applications."

Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can elicit plant defenses, but whether such ecological functions persist after they form SOAs was previously unknown. Here we show that Scots pine seedlings damaged by large pine weevils feeding on their roots release HIPVs that trigger defenses in neighboring conspecific plants. The biological activity persisted after HIPVs had been oxidized to form SOAs, which was indicated by receivers displaying enhanced photosynthesis, primed volatile defenses, and reduced weevil damage. The elemental composition and quantity of SOAs likely determines their biological functions.

We demonstrate an alternative pathway, where hydrogenation of layered transition metal oxide cathodes induces self-discharge through hydrogen transfer from carbonate solvents to delithiated oxides. In self-discharged cathodes, we further observe opposing proton and lithium ion concentration gradients, which contribute to chemical and structural heterogeneities within delithiated cathodes, accelerating degradation.

Despite this, our understanding of the processes that control lipid degradation is limited. We combined nanolipidomics and imaging to study the bacterial degradation of diverse algal lipid droplets and found that bacteria isolated from marine particles exhibited distinct dietary preferences, ranging from selective to promiscuous degraders. Dietary preference was associated with a distinct set of lipid degradation genes rather than with taxonomic origin. Using synthetic communities composed of isolates with distinct dietary preferences, we showed that lipid degradation is modulated by microbial interactions.

In this work, we identify a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of TCR sensitivity that guides alternative splicing of TCR signaling transcripts through an evolutionarily ultraconserved poison exon (PE) in the RNA-binding protein (RBP) TRA2β in mouse and human.TRA2β-PE splicing, seen during cancer and infection, was required for TCR-induced effector T cell expansion and function.Tra2β-PE skipping enhanced T cell response to antigen by increasing TCR sensitivity. As antigen levels decreased,Tra2β-PE reinclusion allowed T cell survival.

More recently, non-price behavioral interventions have emerged as an alternative. However, there is limited data on the relative efficacies of price and non-price interventions. We report results from long-term field experiments studying unit-level water conservation responses to both price and non-price interventions in the same group of households (n = 64 186 household-days). Conservation habits, attitude-action gaps, principal-agent incongruities, and billing cycles help account for the heterogeneity in response between households, and across time. A non-price behavior modification intervention before the introduction of marginal pricing resulted in a large and significant effect on treated households (33%). The subsequent introduction of marginal volumetric pricing also reduced water use (8%, for previously untreated households). However, this average price effect masks how a large share (21%) of households increased water use, or how a mere 12% of the households accounted for all the aggregate reduction in water use. We investigated such heterogeneous responses as a systematic conservation maximization design question beyond statistical variance in individual responses. We used daily water consumption measurements across three years alongside a household survey to delineate structural and agentic barriers to conservation behavior. Our analysis reveals how combining price and non-price behavioral interventions could hold the key to achieving conservation effects that are both large and persistent."

P. Olsen Ice Cap transect, northeast Greenland, for May 2008 through May 2022","The Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring programme has been running since 1995. In 2008, the Glaciological monitoring sub-program GlacioBasis was initiated at the Zackenberg site in northeast Greenland, with a transect of three weather stations on the A. P. Olsen Ice Cap. In 2022, the weather stations were replaced with a more standardized set up. Here, we provide the reprocessed and quality-checked data from 2008 to 2022, i.e., the first 15 years of continued monitoring. 
 The negative surface mass balance of glaciers and ice caps under a warming climate impacts local ecosystems, influencing the volume and timing of water flow in local catchments while also contributing to global sea level rise. Peripheral glaciers distinct to the Greenland ice sheet respond faster to climate change than the main ice sheet. Accurate assessment of surface mass balance depends on in situ observations of near-surface climate and ice ablation, but very few in situ observations of near-surface climate and ice ablation are freely available for Greenland's peripheral glaciers. The transect of three automated weather and ablation stations on the peripheral A. P. Olsen Ice Cap in northeast Greenland is an example of these much needed data. The transect has been monitored since 2008, and in 2022, the old weather and ablation stations were replaced by a new standardized setup. In order to ensure comparable data quality of the old and new monitoring station setups, it is necessary to re-evaluate the data collected between 2008 and 2022. This paper presents the fully reprocessed near-surface climate and ablation data from the A. P. Olsen Ice Cap transect from 2008 to 2022, with a focus on data quality and the usability in ice ablation process studies. The usability of the data is exemplified by the data in an energy balance melt model for two different years. We show that the inherent uncertainties in the data result in an accurate reproduction of ice ablation for just one of the two years. A transect of three automatic ablation and weather stations of this length is unique to Greenland's peripheral glaciers, and it has a broad scale of usage from input to climate reanalysis and detailed surface ablation studies.

Accurate mapping of the spatial-thickness variations of these fallout pyroclastic deposits over large hillslope areas remains a knowledge gap. We attempt to bridge this gap by applying statistical techniques to a field-based thickness measurement dataset of fallout pyroclastic deposits. 
 Determining the spatial thickness (z) of in situ and reworked fallout pyroclastic deposits plays a key role in volcanological studies and in shedding light on geomorphological and hydrogeological processes in peri-volcanic areas. However, this is a challenging line of research because (1) field-based measurements are expensive and time-consuming, (2) the ash might have been dispersed in the atmosphere by several volcanic eruptions, and (3) wind characteristics during an eruptive event and soil-forming and/or denudation processes after ash deposition on the ground surface affect the expected spatial distribution of these deposits. This article tries to bridge this knowledge gap by applying statistical techniques for making representative spatial thickness predictions to be used for the analysis of geomorphic processes at the catchment and sub-catchment scales. First, we compiled a field-based thickness measurement dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8399487; Matano et al., 2023) of fallout pyroclastic deposits in the territories of several municipalities in Campania, southern Italy. Second, 18 predictor variables were derived mainly from digital elevation models and satellite images and were assigned to each measurement point. Third, the stepwise regression (STPW) model and random forest (RF) machine learning technique are used for thickness modeling. Fourth, the estimations are compared with those of three models that already exist in the literature. Finally, the statistical combination of different predictions is implemented to develop a less biased model for estimating pyroclastic thickness. The results show that the prediction accuracy of RF (RMSE <82.46 and MAE <48.36) is better than that of existing models in the literature. Moreover, statistical combination of the predictions obtained from the above-mentioned models through a least absolute deviation (LAD) combination approach leads to the most representative thickness estimation (MAE <45.12) in the study area. The maps for the values estimated by RF and LAD (as the best single model and combination approach, respectively) illustrate that the spatial patterns did not change significantly, but the estimations by LAD are smaller. This combined approach can help in estimating the thickness of fallout pyroclastic deposits in other volcanic regions and in managing geohazards in areas covered with loose pyroclastic materials."

Satellite remote sensing plays a pivotal role in detecting this phenomenon. This study uses AI-based models to extract the daily green tide from MODIS and SAR images and integrates these daily data to introduce a continuous weekly dataset, which aids research in disaster simulation, forecasting, and prevention. 
 Since 2008, the Yellow Sea has experienced the world's largest-scale marine disaster, the green tide, marked by the rapid proliferation and accumulation of large floating algae. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models, namely AlgaeNet and GANet, this study comprehensively extracted and analyzed green tide occurrences using optical Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and microwave Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, due to cloud and rain interference and the varying observation frequencies of the two types of satellites, the daily green tide coverage time series throughout the entire life cycle often contain large gaps and missing frames, resulting in discontinuity and limiting their use. Therefore, this study presents a continuous and seamless weekly average green tide coverage dataset with a resolution of 500 m, by integrating highly precise daily optical and SAR data for each week during the green tide breakout. The uncertainty assessment shows that this weekly product conforms to the life pattern of green tide outbreaks and exhibits parabolic-curve-like characteristics, with a low uncertainty (R2=0.89 and RMSE=275 km2). This weekly dataset offers reliable long-term data spanning 15 years, facilitating research in forecasting, climate change analysis, numerical simulation, and disaster prevention planning in the Yellow Sea.

The accuracy of SDUST2022GRA is 4.43 mGal on a global scale, which is at least 0.22 mGal better than that of other models. The spatial resolution of SDUST2022GRA is approximately 20 km in a certain region, slightly superior to other models. These assessments suggest that SDUST2022GRA is a reliable global marine gravity anomaly model. 
 The global marine gravity anomaly model is predominantly recovered from along-track radar altimeter data. Despite significant advances in gravity anomaly recovery, the improvement of the gravity anomaly model remains constrained by the absence of cross-track geoid gradients and the reduction in radar altimeter data, especially in coastal and high-latitude regions. ICESat-2 laser altimetry, with a three-pair laser beam configuration, a small footprint, and a near-polar orbit, facilitates the determination of cross-track geoid gradients and provides valid observations in certain regions. We present an ICESat-2 altimeter data processing strategy that includes the determination of cross-track geoid gradients and the combination of along-track and cross-track geoid gradients. Utilizing these methods, we developed a new global marine gravity model, SDUST2022GRA, from radar and laser altimeter data. Different weight determination methods were applied to each type of altimeter datum. The precision and spatial resolution of SDUST2022GRA were assessed against published altimeter-derived global gravity anomaly models (DTU17, V32.1, NSOAS22) and shipborne gravity measurements. SDUST2022GRA achieved a global precision of 4.43 mGal, representing an improvement of approximately 0.22 mGal over existing altimeter-derived models. In local coastal and high-latitude regions, SDUST2022GRA showed an enhancement of 0.16–0.24 mGal compared to the other models. The spatial resolution of SDUST2022GRA is approximately 20 km in certain regions, which is slightly superior to the other models. The percentage contribution of ICESat-2 to the improvement of the gravity anomaly model is 4.3 % in low- to mid-latitude regions by comparing SDUST2022GRA with ICESat-2 to SDUST2021GRA without ICESat-2, and this is increasing in coastal regions. These assessments suggest that SDUST2022GRA is a reliable global marine gravity anomaly model. The SDUST2022GRA data are freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8337387 (Li et al., 2023)."

To facilitate Lagrangian analysis, we introduce online tracking of sea ice in Community Ice CodE (CICE). We validate the sea ice tracking with buoys and evaluate the sea ice deformation in high-resolution simulations, which show multi-fractal characteristics. The source code is openly available and can be used in various scientific and operational applications. 
 Sea ice models are essential tools for simulating the thermodynamic and dynamic processes of sea ice and the coupling with the polar atmosphere and ocean. Popular models such as the Community Ice CodE (CICE) are usually based on non-moving, locally orthogonal Eulerian grids. However, the various in situ observations, such as those from ice-tethered buoys and drift stations, are subjected to sea ice drift and are, hence, by nature Lagrangian. Furthermore, the statistical analysis of sea ice kinematics requires the Lagrangian perspective. As a result, the offline sea ice tracking with model output is usually carried out for many scientific and validational practices. Certain limitations exist, such as the need for high-frequency model outputs, as well as unaccountable tracking errors. In order to facilitate Lagrangian diagnostics in current sea ice models, we design and implement an online Lagrangian tracking module in CICE under the coupled model system of CESM (Community Earth System Model). In this work, we introduce its design and implementation in detail, as well as the numerical experiments for the validation and the analysis of sea ice deformation. In particular, the sea ice model is forced with historical atmospheric reanalysis data, and the Lagrangian tracking results are compared with the observed buoys' tracks for the years from 1979 to 2001. Moreover, high-resolution simulations are carried out with the Lagrangian tracking to study the multi-scale sea ice deformation modeled by CICE. Through scaling analysis, we show that CICE simulates multi-fractal sea ice deformation fields in both the spatial and the temporal domain, as well as the spatial–temporal coupling characteristics. The analysis with model output on the Eulerian grid shows systematic difference with the Lagrangian-tracking-based results, highlighting the importance of the Lagrangian perspective for scaling analysis. Related topics, including the sub-daily sea ice kinematics and the potential application of the Lagrangian tracking module, are also discussed."

Due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment and several toxic effects described, human exposure to these chemicals gained increasing attention in recent years. However, very limited data on the biotransformation of QACs is available, hampering exposure assessment. In this study, three QACs (dimethyl dodecyl ammonium, C10-DDAC; benzyldimethyl dodecylammonium, C12-BAC; cetyltrimethylammonium, C16-ATMAC) commonly detected in indoor microenvironments were incubated with human liver microsomes and cytosol (HLM/HLC) simulating Phase I and II metabolism. Thirty-one Phase I metabolites were annotated originating from 19 biotransformation reactions. Four metabolites of C10-DDAC were described for the first time. A detailed assessment of experimental fragmentation spectra allowed to characterize potential oxidation sites. For each annotated metabolite, drift-tube ion-mobility derived collision cross section (DTCCSN2) values were reported, serving as an additional identification parameter and allowing the characterization of changes in DTCCSN2 values following metabolism. Lastly, eight metabolites, including four metabolites of both C12-BAC and C10-DDAC, were confirmed in human urine samples showing high oxidation states through introduction of up to four oxygen atoms. This is the first report of higher oxidized C10-DDAC metabolites in human urine facilitating future biomonitoring studies on QACs."

Here, using magnetospheric multiscale mission, we find a strong dawn‐dusk current with a magnitude of 80 nA/m2 at the magnetotail PSBL. The strong current appears during crossing the PSBL and is primarily contributed by the perpendicular electron currents. Cooperating with an intense fluctuating electric field (reaching ∼40 mV/m) carried by the lower‐hybrid drift waves, this dawn‐dusk current leads to a strong energy conversion with a magnitude larger than 3 nW/m3.

Here we propose a physical forward model of scattered waves in a deformable medium that includes acousto‐elastic effect, which refers to non‐linear elasticity with third‐order elastic constants. The model shows that small pressure perturbations of a few kPa due to seasonal variations in the water table can induce seismic velocity changes compatible with those measured at the surface by ambient noise interferometry.

They illustrate the capability in modeling the diffuse wavefield from scattering synthetic waves to reproduce ambient noise signals for monitoring environmental and/or deep reservoir signals."

 Cell-cell junctions, and specifically desmosomes, are crucial for robust intercellular adhesion. Desmosomal function is compromised in the autoimmune blistering skin disease pemphigus vulgaris. We combine whole-genome knockout screening and a promotor screen of the desmosomal gene desmoglein 3 in human keratinocytes to identify novel regulators of intercellular adhesion. Kruppel-like-factor 5 (KLF5) directly binds to the desmoglein 3 regulatory region and promotes adhesion. Reduced levels of KLF5 in patient tissue indicate a role in pemphigus vulgaris. Autoantibody fractions from patients impair intercellular adhesion and reduce KLF5 levels in in vitro and in vivo disease models. These effects were dependent on increased activity of histone deacetylase 3, leading to transcriptional repression of KLF5. Inhibiting histone deacetylase 3 increases KLF5 levels and protects against the deleterious effects of autoantibodies in murine and human pemphigus vulgaris models. Together, KLF5 and histone deacetylase 3 are regulators of desmoglein 3 gene expression and intercellular adhesion and represent potential therapeutic targets in pemphigus vulgaris.

 Metabolic imbalance leading to inflammatory hypoxia and stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel diseases. We hypothesize that HIF could be stabilized in CD4+ T cells during intestinal inflammation and alter the functional responses of T cells via regulation of microRNAs. Our assays reveal markedly increased T cell-intrinsic hypoxia and stabilization of HIF protein during experimental colitis. microRNA screen in primary CD4+ T cells points us towards miR-29a and our subsequent studies identify a selective role for HIF-2α in CD4-cell-intrinsic induction of miR-29a during hypoxia. Mice with T cell-intrinsic HIF-2α deletion display elevated T-bet (target of miR-29a) levels and exacerbated intestinal inflammation. Mice with miR-29a deficiency in T cells show enhanced intestinal inflammation. T cell-intrinsic overexpression of HIF-2α or delivery of miR-29a mimetic dampen TH1-driven colitis. In this work, we show a previously unrecognized function for hypoxia-dependent induction of miR-29a in attenuating TH1-mediated inflammation.

Here authors demonstrate BRN1/2 act in concert with NOTCH and primary microcephaly genes to regulate evolutionarily conserved neocortical progenitor behavior across species and determine brain size. 
 The neocortex varies in size and complexity among mammals due to the tremendous variability in the number and diversity of neuronal subtypes across species. The increased cellular diversity is paralleled by the expansion of the pool of neocortical progenitors and the emergence of indirect neurogenesis during brain evolution. The molecular pathways that control these biological processes and are disrupted in neurological disorders remain largely unknown. Here we show that the transcription factors BRN1 and BRN2 have an evolutionary conserved function in neocortical progenitors to control their proliferative capacity and the switch from direct to indirect neurogenesis. Functional studies in mice and ferrets show that BRN1/2 act in concert with NOTCH and primary microcephaly genes to regulate progenitor behavior. Analysis of transcriptomics data from genetically modified macaques provides evidence that these molecular pathways are conserved in non-human primates. Our findings thus demonstrate that BRN1/2 are central regulators of gene expression programs in neocortical progenitors critical to determine brain size during evolution.

Here, a Ni2+-dependent enzyme that hydrolysed metformin to guanylurea and its evolutionary predecessor are presented. 
 The anti-diabetic drug metformin is one of the most widely prescribed medicines in the world. Together with its degradation product guanylurea, it is a major pharmaceutical pollutant in wastewater treatment plants and surface waters. An operon comprising two genes of the ureohydrolase family in Pseudomonas and Aminobacter species has recently been implicated in metformin degradation. However, the corresponding proteins have not been characterized. Here we show that these genes encode a Ni2+-dependent enzyme that efficiently and specifically hydrolyzes metformin to guanylurea and dimethylamine. The active enzyme is a heteromeric complex of α- and β- subunits in which only the α-subunits contain the conserved His and Asp residues for the coordination of two Ni2+ ions in the active site. A crystal structure of metformin hydrolase reveals an α2β4 stoichiometry of the hexameric complex, which is unprecedented in the ureohydrolase family. By studying a closely related but more widely distributed enzyme, we find that the putative predecessor specifically hydrolyzes dimethylguanidine instead of metformin. Our findings establish the molecular basis for metformin hydrolysis to guanylurea as the primary pathway for metformin biodegradation and provide insight into the recent evolution of ureohydrolase family proteins in response to an anthropogenic compound.

 The increasing risk of irreversible ecological transformation under global warming has boosted the need to understand the capacity of organisms to adapt to this change. Here, using a resurvey method of populations of the European fly Drosophila subobscura, we show that a known evolutionary response to global warming has accelerated in the past 20 years, in step with regional warming. This genetic response has come entirely by resorting pre-existing variation—and not from novel inversions—for tolerance to high temperature. Temperate populations are predicted to converge to the typical Mediterranean chromosomal composition by the mid-2050s, at which point this classic example of steep genetic cline will have vanished. Our results suggest that species with broad geographic ranges, large population sizes and high genetic diversity may have the evolutionary potential to cope with climate change.

 Temperature and precipitation variability and extremes impact production globally. These production disruptions will change with future warming, impacting consumers locally as well as remotely through supply chains. Due to a potentially nonlinear economic response, trade impacts are difficult to quantify; empirical assessments rather focus on the direct inequality impacts of weather extremes. Here, simulating global economic interactions of profit-maximizing firms and utility-optimizing consumers, we assess risks to consumption resulting from weather-induced production disruptions along supply chains. Across countries, risks are highest for middle-income countries due to unfavourable trade dependence and seasonal climate exposure. We also find that risks increase in most countries under future climate change. Global warming increases consumer risks locally and through supply chains. However, high-income consumers face the greatest risk increase. Overall, risks are heterogeneous regarding income within and between countries, such that targeted local and global resilience building may reduce them.

 Anthropogenic perturbations profoundly affect aquatic ecosystem microbiomes and associated ecological functions. Comparatively, the effects of geological stresses on microbiome composition and stability remain poorly explored. Here, we monitored the archaeal, bacterial and microeukaryotes community structure over an 8-years period in Lake Dziani Dzaha (Comoros archipelago), that experienced a major earthquake swarm mid-survey, providing a rare opportunity to investigate the aftermaths of seismo-volcanic events on microbiome.

 Environmental factors shape subsurface microbial ecosystems, and well-characterized sites are ideal for determining how environmental parameters shape sediment communities. Sediments from eight geologically and thermally distinct sites were drilled during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 385 in Guaymas Basin, an expedition focused on the hydrothermal deep biosphere. Using high-throughput 16S ribosomal nucleic acid sequencing, cell counts, phylogenetics, metatranscriptomics, and mineralogical/elemental X-ray spectroscopy, we examine linkages and feedbacks between mineral composition, temperature, geochemistry, and microbial populations. We show subsurface life is dominated by heterotrophic, cosmopolitan prokaryotes that thrive within a range of sediments and temperature conditions across Guaymas Basin. Hydrothermally-affiliated lineages are detected in low numbers at sites with steepest temperature gradients, within communities of mesophilic taxa that occur throughout Guaymas Basin and in other marine subsurface habitats. Thus, hydrothermal lineages do not replace the cosmopolitan, mesophilic subsurface community, but remain specific to sites where volcanic intrusions drive hydrothermal circulation. “Subsurface bacteria and archaea in the Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California, thrive within a wide range of sediments and temperature conditions, according to geobiological, geochemical, and mineralogical studies on microbial populations and sediment samples.”"

 Understanding and managing unrest at a volcano include i) ascertaining the magmatic distribution and migration, and ii) tracking the evolution of the shallow plumbing system. Here we use multi-technique geodetic data, mechanical models, and petrological simulations to define both aspects for the ongoing (2005-present) unrest at Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy. Results show a deformation source exhibiting progressive widening and shallowing, from 5.9 to 3.9 kilometres. Concurrently, a deeper tabular source at 8 km depth experiences limited but constant deflation. Petrological calculations explain inflation of the shallower source resulting from the rise of 0.06 to 0.22 cubic kilometres of magma from depth ≥8 kilometres. Our analysis provides strong evidence that magma ascent to depths shallower than 8 kilometres is the ultimate driver behind the ongoing unrest. This merging of geodetic and petrological approaches to track the evolution of a plumbing system better constrains magma ascent at volcanoes experiencing unrest.

 The dynamics of surface water in the Yangtze Plain is complex, influenced by the coupled impacts of climate change and intensifying human activities. However, remote sensing observations often encounter challenges in this region due to persistent cloud cover, impeding comprehensive studies of water dynamics.

 The determination of river velocity is important for hydromorphological analyses and river monitoring systems. Indirect measurements of river velocity using videos recorded by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) allow fast and cost-effective processing of information about the river stretch. This paper presents a method for computing flow velocity of the river surface using deep supervised model RAFT to determine the optical flow in combination with image pre-processing by convolutional operations. Moreover, the windiness coefficients and variance score were proposed to evaluate reliability of the collected data and the obtained results of optical flow detection. Various image pre-processing techniques were applied, namely the selection of the analysed area and the number of convolutional operations to select the one with the lowest variance score. This score represents the consistency of the river flow velocity during the video and can be used to filter out unreliable results. The numerical experiments were performed using the videos and directly measured velocity values of 4 shallow rivers in Lithuania collected during the field surveys. The optical velocity estimation method showed good correspondence to the directly measured values for the velocity range from 0 m/s to 0.8 m/s in the points with low variance score up to 0.192 that represents the first quartile of the variance. The optical flow method tends to underestimate the velocity up to 0.5 m/s for the quartiles with the higher variance scores. It was shown that in most cases the lowest variance score value was obtained using pre-processing techniques without convolutional operations. However, the need to analyse various pre-processing techniques arises from the different origin of the objects moving on the river surface."

 The launch of GEDI opens a new era of forest structure monitoring using full-waveform LiDAR from space. Simulation of GEDI waveform is of great importance for the algorithm design and forest structure metric estimation. DART is a universal 3D radiative transfer model for simulating remote sensing signals by modeling light propagation in 3D landscape, with DART-RC adopting forward ray tracing and DART-Lux adopting bidirectional path tracing to model multi-mode multi-platform LiDAR signals. GEDI simulator is a semi-empirical model for simulating GEDI waveform with point clouds. In view of their different solutions, this study aims to evaluate and inter-compare the accuracy of DART-RC, DART-Lux, and GEDI simulator for simulating GEDI waveforms in forests. Because there are possible geolocation errors and 3D modeling uncertainty in real forests, we propose to adopt virtual forests (turbid medium, RAMI scenes) for consistency evaluation and real forests for accuracy evaluation. Metrics including R2 (coefficient of determination), RMSD (root mean square deviation), RMSE (root mean square error), and bias were calculated from the normalized waveform intensities from different simulation methods.According to the results, it is demonstrated that DART-RC/Lux, when only considering first order scattering, can simulate waveforms that are highly consistent compared to GEDI simulator in virtual forests. In real forests, DART-RC/Lux which considers first order and multiple scattering can simulate more accurate waveforms than GEDI simulator in sparse canopies (ePAI < 1.2). The median R2 were 0.935, 0.928, 0.898 and the median RMSE were 0.035, 0.037, 0.044, for DART-RC, DART-Lux and GEDI simulator respectively. However, GEDI simulator slightly outperforms DART-RC/Lux in dense canopies (ePAI > 1.2). The challenge in accurate forest 3D modeling is the most likely reason causing decreasing accuracy of DART-RC/Lux in dense forests. We recommend the use of GEDI simulator when airborne point cloud is available, while the use of DART-RC and DART-Lux for mechanism studies or theoretical analysis.

 Accurately estimating fractional cover of vegetated ecosystems over large areas is essential for many scientific studies, including climate change, land cover and land use, etc. Taking both accuracy and large spatial coverage into account, different methods have been proposed, such as upscaling from high to low spatial resolution remote sensing images, and harmonized data from varied sources. In this work, a new method, called centroid-based endmember optimization (CEO), is proposed to assist endmember selection for fractional cover estimation using the triangular space method. The basic idea is to retrieve endmembers from a triangular space built on a fine spatial resolution image, then correct and apply them to a coarse spatial resolution image. The method is discussed and tested using Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI images to estimate non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), photosynthetic vegetation (PV), and bare soil (BS) fractional cover. With CEO, the fractional cover of an OLCI image can be estimated more accurately, reducing the work of mosaicking MSI images to acquire fractional cover of the same large area. The premises that CEO can be applied effectively are: (1) the acquisition dates of the MSI and OLCI images are close, ensuring a similar land cover; and (2) the spatial overlap between the MSI and OLCI images covers enough NPV, PV, and BS endmembers. When taken the average fractional cover retrieved from an MSI image as truth value, the CEO method reduced the estimation difference to 0.7%, compared to the differences of 8.1% and 6.6% retrieved using uncorrected or incompletely corrected triangular space method of an OLCI image, respectively. In addition to the average fractional cover estimation, the histogram of fractional cover distribution also improved obviously. When applying CEO to a full OLCI image, two full MSI images covering different locations were used for fractional cover validation, which supported a robust estimation result."

To clarify this issue, we conduct a series of perfect model hindcast experiments to untangle the individual and synergistic effects of the tropical Indian and Atlantic oceans. Our results clearly demonstrate that without these cross-basin effects, the Pacific warming would rarely reach super El Niño level. Specifically, the individual effect of the Indian Ocean efficiently enhances the development of super El Niño events. In contrast, the Atlantic’s effect is initially limited because it fails to establish the Bjerknes feedback in the Pacific. However, when coupled with the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic’s effect becomes more pronounced as it is amplified by the Bjerknes feedback established by the Indian Ocean."

Here, we present two-dimensional assemblies of acene chromophores achieved using a tripodal triptycene supramolecular scaffold, which have been shown to exhibit a strong ability to assemble molecular and polymer motifs two-dimensionally. We designed pentacene and anthracene derivatives sandwiched by two triptycene units. These compounds assemble into expected two-dimensional structures, with the pentacene chromophores having both sufficient overlap to cause singlet fission and space for conformational change to facilitate the dissociation of a triplet pair into free triplets, which is not the case for the anthracene analog. Detailed spectroscopic analysis revealed that the pentacene chromophore in the assembly undergoes singlet fission with a quantum yield of 88 ± 5%, giving rise to triplet pairs, from which free triplets are efficiently generated (ΦT= 130 ± 8.8%). This demonstrates the utility of the triptycene-based scaffold to design functional π-electronic molecular assemblies."

Still, the mechanisms governing the targeting of selected regions of the genome to nucleolus-associated domains (NADs) remain enigmatic. Here, we reveal the essential role of ZNF274, a SCAN-bearing member of the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)–containing zinc finger protein (KZFP) family, in sequestering lineage-specific gene clusters within NADs. Ablation of ZNF274 triggers transcriptional activation across entire genomic neighborhoods—encompassing, among others, protocadherin and KZFP-encoding genes—with loss of repressive chromatin marks, altered the 3D genome architecture and de novo CTCF binding. Mechanistically, ZNF274 anchors target DNA sequences at the nucleolus and facilitates their compartmentalization via a previously uncharted function of the SCAN domain. Our findings illuminate the mechanisms underlying NAD organization and suggest that perinucleolar entrapment into repressive hubs constrains the activation of tandemly arrayed genes to enable selective expression and modulate cell differentiation programs during development."

Using electromagnetically induced transparency and coherence control, our SSWM scheme allows versatile narrowband triphoton generation with advantageous properties, including long temporal coherence and controllable waveforms.

MNK1 is known to influence cancer stem cells (CSCs); self-renewing populations that support metastasis, recurrence, and chemotherapeutic resistance, making them a clinically relevant target. The precise function of MNK1 in regulating CSCs, however, remains unexplored. Here, we generated MNK1 knockout cancer cell lines, resulting in diminished CSC properties in vitro and slowed tumor growth in vivo. Using a multiomics approach, we functionally demonstrated that loss of MNK1 restricts tumor cell metabolic adaptation by reducing glycolysis and increasing dependence on oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, MNK1-null breast and pancreatic tumor cells demonstrated suppressed metastasis to the liver, but not the lung. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data from breast cancer patients validated the positive correlation between MNK1 and glycolytic enzyme protein expression.

Its properties dynamically respond to the submolecular architecture of the tissue and the partial pressure of oxygen. Current PET systems record only two annihilation photons and cannot provide information about the positronium lifetime. This study presents the in vivo images of positronium lifetime in a human, for a patient with a glioblastoma brain tumor, by using the dedicated Jagiellonian PET system enabling simultaneous detection of annihilation photons and prompt gamma emitted by a radionuclide. The prompt gamma provides information on the time of positronium formation. The photons from positronium annihilation are used to reconstruct the place and time of its decay. In the presented case study, the determined positron and positronium lifetimes in glioblastoma cells are shorter than those in salivary glands and those in healthy brain tissues, indicating that positronium imaging could be used to diagnose disease in vivo."

This leads to defective calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial malfunction, CD4+lymphopenia, a quasi-absence of naïve CD4+and CD8+cells, an increase in memory cells, and a distinct TCR repertoire. The calcium defect was recapitulated in Jurkat knock-in. Site-directed mutagenesis displayed the exquisite sensitivity of Arg2524to any amino acid change. Despite the fact that all patients had severe immunodeficiency, they also displayed variable multisystemic involvements, including ectodermal dysplasia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, short stature, and bone marrow failure. In conclusion, unlike previously reportedITPR1-3deficiencies leading to narrow, mainly neurological phenotypes, a recurrent dominantITPR3variant leads to a multisystemic disease, defining a unique role for IP3R3 in the tetrameric IP3R complex."

South China Sea (SCS) exemplifies this complexity, where interactions with the Pacific, particularly through Kuroshio intrusion, challenge the understanding of CANTsource and variability in a coastal ocean. Contrary to prevailing paradigm expectations, our high-resolution, long-term data reveal that CANTin the SCS primarily originates from Pacific water injection across the Luzon Strait rather than atmospheric CO2invasion. Over the past two decades, the SCS has experienced increasing CANTlevels, with notable interannual fluctuations driven by El Niño and La Niña events influencing Kuroshio intrusion, generating anomalously high and low CANTinventories, respectively.

To produce such motifs, plants specify boundaries dividing petals into subdomains where cells develop distinctive pigmentations, shapes, and textures. While some transcription factors and biosynthetic pathways behind these characteristics are well studied, the upstream processes restricting their activities to specific petal regions remain enigmatic. Here, we unveil that the petal surface ofHibiscus trionum, an emerging model featuring a bullseye on its corolla, is prepatterned as the bullseye boundary position is specified long before it becomes visible. Using a computational model, we explore how pattern proportions are maintained while petals experience a 100-fold size increase. Exploiting transgenic lines and natural variants, we show that plants can regulate boundary position during the prepatterning phase or modulate growth on either side of this boundary later in development to vary bullseye proportions. Such modifications are functionally relevant, as buff-tailed bumblebees can reliably identify food sources based on bullseye size and prefer certain pattern proportions."

Roughly half of the heat that Earth loses through its surface today comes from the three long-lived, heat-producing elements (potassium, thorium, and uranium). These three elements have long been believed to be highly lithophile and thus concentrate in the mantle of rocky planets. However, our study shows that they all become siderophile under the pressure and temperature conditions relevant to the core formation of large rocky planets dubbed super-Earths. Mantle convection in super-Earths is then primarily driven by heating from the core rather than by a mix of internal heating and cooling from above as in Earth. Partitioning these sources of radiogenic heat into the core remarkably increases the core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature and the total heat flow across the CMB in super-Earths. Consequently, super-Earths are likely to host long-lived volcanism and strong magnetic dynamos."

Turbulence in common fluids like water and air, mathematically described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), engenders spontaneous self-stretching and twisting of vortex lines, generating a complex hierarchy of structures. While the INSE are routinely used to describe turbulence, their regularity remains unproven; the implicit assumption being that the self-stretching is ultimately regularized by viscosity, preventing any singularities. Here, we uncover an inviscid regularizing mechanism stemming from self-stretching itself, by analyzing the flow topology as perceived by an observer aligned with the vorticity vector undergoing amplification. While, initially, vorticity amplification occurs via increasing twisting of vortex lines, a regularizing anti-twist spontaneously emerges to prevent unbounded growth. By isolating a vortex, we additionally demonstrate the genericity of this self-regularizing anti-twist. Our work, directly linking dynamics of vortices to turbulence statistics, reveals how the Navier-Stokes dynamics avoids the development of singularities even without the aid of viscosity."

We mimicked the interplay of these proteins using the “comet tail” bead motility assay, where branched actin networks are nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex on the surface of beads coated with myosin-I and nucleation-promoting factor. We observed that myosin-I increased bead movement efficiency by thinning actin networks without affecting growth rates. Myosin-I triggered symmetry breaking and comet tail formation in dense networks resistant to spontaneous fracturing. Even with arrested actin assembly, myosin-I alone could break the network. Computational modeling recapitulated these observations, suggesting myosin-I acts as a repulsive force shaping the network’s architecture and boosting its force-generating capacity.

The overarching aim of this research was to develop machine learning (ML) models to predict GAC performance from adsorbent, adsorbate, and background water matrix properties. For model calibration, MP breakthrough curves were compiled and analyzed to determine the bed volumes of water that can be treated until MP breakthrough reaches ten percent of the influent MP concentration (BV10). Over 400 data points were split into training, validation, and testing sets. Seventeen variables describing MP, background water matrix, and GAC properties were explored in ML models to predict log10-transformed BV10 values. Using the ML models on the testing set, predicted BV10 values exhibited mean absolute errors of ∼0.12 log units and were highly correlated with experimentally determined values (R2 ≥ 0.88).

Lindsay,Uranium Speciation and Mobilization in Thawing Permafrost,"Uranium is a toxic and pervasive geogenic contaminant often associated with organic matter. Its abundance and speciation in organic-rich permafrost soils are unknown, thereby limiting our ability to assess risks associated with uranium mobilization during permafrost thaw. In this study, we assessed uranium speciation in permafrost soil and porewater liberated during thaw using active-layer and permafrost samples from a study area in Yukon, Canada where elevated uranium concentrations occur in bedrock and groundwater. Permafrost contained 1.1–28 wt % organic carbon and elevated uranium (range 7.6–1040 μg g–1, median 25 μg g–1) relative to local bedrock. The highest soil uranium concentrations were encountered in catchments hosting uranium-enriched bedrock and correlated positively with soil organic carbon. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, micro-X-ray fluorescence, and electron microscopy analyses revealed that solid-phase uranium predominantly occurs as uranium(VI) associated with soil organic matter. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses suggested the presence of uranium(VI) coordinated with carbon, consistent with bidentate-mononuclear uranyl complexation on carboxyl groups. Permafrost thaw produced circumneutral pH porewater (pH 6.2–7.5) with elevated dissolved uranium (0.5–203 μg L–1). Geochemical modeling indicated that calcium-uranyl-carbonate complexes dominated the dissolved uranium speciation. This study highlights that permafrost soil can mobilize uranium upon thaw and that uranium fate is linked to dynamic biogeochemical reactions involving organic carbon and groundwater chemistry."

Although the formation of Fe(III) minerals in AMD-impacted waters has previously been reported to be regulated by biological processes, the role of abiotic processes remains largely unknown. This study first reported that a photochemical reaction coupled with O2 significantly accelerated the formation of Fe(III) flocculates (i.e., schwertmannite) in the AMD, as evidenced by the comparison of samples from contaminated sites across different natural conditions at latitudes 24–29° N. Combined with experimental and modeling results, it is further discovered that the intramolecular oxidation of photogenerated Fe(II) with a five-coordinative pyramidal configuration (i.e., [(H2O)5Fe]2+) by O2 was the key in enhancing the photooxidation of Fe(II) in the simulated AMD. The in situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR), UV–vis spectroscopy, solvent substitution, and quantum yield analyses indicated that, acting as a precursor for flocculation, [(H2O)5Fe]2+ likely originated from both the dissolved and colloidal forms of Fe(III) through homogeneous and surface ligand-to-metal charge transfers. Density functional theory calculations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy results further suggested that the specific oxidation pathways of Fe(II) produced the highly reactive iron species and triggered the hydrolysis and formation of transient dihydroxo dimers. The proposed new pathways of Fe cycle are crucial in controlling the mobility of heavy metal anions in acidic waters and enhance the understanding of complicated iron biochemistry that is related to the fate of contaminants and nutrients."

Herein, a high-efficiency and energy-saving photothermal synergistic catalytic oxidation method was developed for the removal of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). Compared to traditional thermocatalysis, the 1,2-DCE conversion over Ru–U6S in photothermal synergistic catalysis at 340 °C increased by approximately 44% not only reducing energy consumption but also avoiding the instability of MOF structure caused by high reaction temperature. The excellent photothermal catalytic oxidation activity was derived from the synergistic effect of photo- and thermocatalysis. Ru–U6S demonstrated excellent 1,2-DCE adsorption capacity and stronger light utilization and could produce more reactive oxygen species (•OH and •O2–) after light illumination, which participated in the oxidation reaction, promoting the release of the active site of the catalyst. The results of H2O-TPD and NH3-DRIFTS exhibited that the use of S-containing ligands in the synthesis process increased the hydroxyl groups and Brønsted acid sites, significantly improved the selectivity of CO2 and HCl in the oxidation process, and reduced the release of chlorine-containing byproducts.

In soil‐ and sediment‐mantled settings topographic roughness may be framed as a competition between roughening and smoothing processes. In many cases, roughening processes may be specific eco‐hydro‐geomorphic events like shrub deaths, tree uprooting, river avulsions, or impact craters. The smoothing processes are all geomorphic processes that operate at smaller scales and tend to drive a diffusive evolution of the surface. In this article, we present a generalized theory that explains topographic roughness as an emergent property of geomorphic systems (semi‐arid plains, forests, alluvial fans, heavily bombarded surfaces) that are periodically shocked by an addition of roughness which subsequently decays due to the action of all small scale, creep‐like processes. We demonstrate theory for the examples listed above, but also illustrate that there is a continuum of topographic forms that the roughening process may take on so that the theory is broadly applicable. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our theory applies to any geomorphic feature that can be described as a pit or mound, pit‐mound couplet, or mound‐pit‐mound complex."

We present evidence that these features may be related to fluid drainage of the slip zone during seismic slip. We sheared water‐saturated kaolinite powders under both fluid drained and undrained conditions, expected for seismic slip at shallow crustal depths. Our results show typical dynamic weakening behavior regardless of conditions. Under fluid drained condition, restrengthening accompanied by the thermal decomposition of kaolinite occurs. In addition, thermal decomposition of kaolinite tends to be initiated at high normal stresses (>5 MPa) with short displacement (<5 m). We propose that thermal pressurization acts as a weakening mechanism but ceases because of fluid drainage, triggering kaolinite thermal decomposition.

 Pathogen-host competition for manganese and intricate immunostimulatory pathways severely attenuates the efficacy of antibacterial immunotherapy against biofilm infections associated with orthopaedic implants. Herein, we introduce a spatiotemporal sono-metalloimmunotherapy (SMIT) strategy aimed at efficient biofilm ablation by custom design of ingenious biomimetic metal-organic framework (PCN-224)-coated MnO2-hydrangea nanoparticles (MnPM) as a metalloantibiotic. Upon reaching the acidic H2O2-enriched biofilm microenvironment, MnPM can convert abundant H2O2 into oxygen, which is conducive to significantly enhancing the efficacy of ultrasound (US)-triggered sonodynamic therapy (SDT), thereby exposing bacteria-associated antigens (BAAs). Moreover, MnPM disrupts bacterial homeostasis, further killing more bacteria. Then, the Mn ions released from the degraded MnO2 can recharge immune cells to enhance the cGAS-STING signaling pathway sensing of BAAs, further boosting the immune response and suppressing biofilm growth via biofilm-specific T cell responses. Following US withdrawal, the sustained oxygenation promotes the survival and migration of fibroblasts, stimulates the expression of angiogenic growth factors and angiogenesis, and neutralizes excessive inflammation. Our findings highlight that MnPM may act as an immune costimulatory metalloantibiotic to regulate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, presenting a promising alternative to antibiotics for orthopaedic biofilm infection treatment and pro-tissue repair.

 How intracellular bacteria subvert the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway is poorly understood. Here, we show that the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi uses its effector protein, Ank5, to inhibit nuclear translocation of the MHC class I gene transactivator, NLRC5, and orchestrate its proteasomal degradation. Ank5 uses a tyrosine in its fourth ankyrin repeat to bind the NLRC5 N-terminus while its F-box directs host SCF complex ubiquitination of NLRC5 in the leucine-rich repeat region that dictates susceptibility to Orientia- and Ank5-mediated degradation. The ability of O. tsutsugamushi strains to degrade NLRC5 correlates with ank5 genomic carriage. Ectopically expressed Ank5 that can bind but not degrade NLRC5 protects the transactivator during Orientia infection. Thus, Ank5 is an immunoevasin that uses its bipartite architecture to rid host cells of NLRC5 and reduce surface MHC class I molecules. This study offers insight into how intracellular pathogens can impair MHC class I expression. Viruses and bacteria are known to subvert the immune system using mimic or inhibitory proteins.

 Expanding and intensifying agriculture has led to a loss of soil carbon. As agroecosystems cover over 40% of Earth’s land surface, they must be part of the solution put in action to mitigate climate change. Development of efficient management practices to maximize soil carbon retention is currently limited, in part, by a poor understanding of how plants, which input carbon to soil, and microbes, which determine its fate there, interact. Here we implement a diversity gradient by intercropping undersown species with barley in a large field trial, ranging from one to eight undersown species. We find that increasing plant diversity strengthens positive associations within the rhizosphere soil microbial community in relation to negative associations. These associations, in turn, enhance community carbon use efficiency. Jointly, our results highlight how increasing plant diversity in agriculture can be used as a management strategy to enhance carbon retention potential in agricultural soils.

 Bestrophin-1 (Best1) is an anion channel genetically linked to vision-threatening retinal degenerative channelopathies. Here, we identify interactions between Best1 and both isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylases (GAD65 and GAD67), elucidate the distinctive influences of GAD65 and GAD67 on Best1’s permeability to various anions/neurotransmitters, discover the functionality of Best1 as a γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor, and solve the structure of GABA-bound Best1. GAD65 and GAD67 both promote Best1-mediated Cl− currents, but only GAD65 drastically enhances the permeability of Best1 to glutamate and GABA, for which GAD67 has no effect. GABA binds to Best1 on an extracellular site and stimulates Best1-mediated Cl− currents at the nano-molar concentration level. The physiological role of GAD65 as a cell type-specific binding partner and facilitator of Best1 is demonstrated in retinal pigment epithelial cells.

Here, a new material structure activated by compression is proposed, yielding strong optical regulation with minute deformation 
 Smart windows, capable of tailoring light transmission, can significantly reduce energy consumption in building services. While mechano-responsive windows activated by strains are promising candidates, they face long-lasting challenges in which the space for the light scatterer’s operation has to be enlarged along with the window size, undermining the practicality. Recent attempts to tackle this challenge inevitably generate side effects with compromised performance in light modulation. Here, we introduce a cuttlefish-inspired design to enable the closing and opening of pores within the 3D porous structure by through-thickness compression, offering opacity and transparency upon release and compression. By changing the activation mode from the conventional in-plane to through-thickness direction, the space requirement is intrinsically decoupled from the lateral size of the scatterer. Central to our design is the asymmetry of pore orientation in the 3D porous structure. These inclined pores against the normal direction increase the opaqueness upon release and improve light modulation sensitivity to compression, enabling transmittance regulation upon compression by an infinitesimal displacement of 50 μm. This work establishes a milestone for smart window technologies and will drive advancements in the development of opto-electric devices.

 Extraction of built-up areas from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images plays a crucial role in disaster management. The polarimetric orientation angles (POAs) of built-up areas exhibit diversity, and built-up areas with POA close to 45° are often misclassified as vegetation. To address this problem, a polarimetric feature suitable for the extraction of built-up areas with large POAs is first designed, and a mixed real-complex-valued polarimetric feature combination is constructed. Then, a real-complex and spatial feature fusion classification network (RCSFFCNet) is designed. In which the proposed mixed real-complex-valued residual structure can efficiently extract mixed numerical features. Additionally, a multi-local spatial convolutional attention module is designed and embedded to efficiently fuse mixed numerical features, as well as superpixel multi-local spatial features. Experiments were conducted using PolSAR images from Gaofen-3, Radarsat-2, and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2. The experimental results show that the feature combination proposed in this paper increases the F1 score of built-up areas by approximately 2%-3%, and the F1 score of built-up areas extracted using the RCSFFCNet also improves by about 2%-3%, with F1 scores exceeding 95%. On all three datasets, the proposed method achieves the best performance in extracting built-up areas with various POAs, indicating overall superiority from feature selection to model implementation."

 Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Matter (TSM) are key health indicators of the coastal ocean and seas. The former is linked to primary productivity, while the latter is associated with water quality; both are influenced by change in climate. Recent studies have highlighted a declining trend in Chl-a levels along the Mediterranean coastal region. River discharge plays an important role in regulating the coastal Chl-a concentration levels. The present research primarily focuses on understanding the significance of Tiber River −driven spatial dynamics of Chl-a and TSM along the central Tyrrhenian Sea coasts. The research also focuses on evaluating the applicability of Sentinel-2 and identifying a suitable method for estimating Chl-a and TSM from Sentinel-2. Neural networks and dark spectrum fitting techniques were applied using multiple algorithms to estimate the dynamic distribution of Chl-a and TSM driven by the Tiber River in the study area. Multiple statistical analyses were performed, and statistically significant relationships were observed. The Case-2 Regional Coast Colour Neural Network (C2RCC-Net) outperformed all other algorithms, with an R2 value of 0.903 for Chl-a and an R2 value of 0.966 for TSM. Furthermore, the present research also identified a positive pixel to pixel spatial correlation between Chl-a and TSM in all four seasons, highlighting the positive impact of Tiber River on maintaining Chl-a levels along the coasts of Tyrrhenian Sea.

 Agricultural drought threatens food security and agricultural sustainable development. There have been numerous spectral indices from remote sensing images developed for monitoring crop drought. However, most present spectral indices are focusing on crop growth and Land Surface Temperature (LST), and the crop canopy water content are in less consideration simultaneously. Additionally, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used for characterizing crop growth in almost all spectral drought indices, with the spectral saturation problem of NDVI for closed crop canopy. When vegetation cover is high, NDVI values tend to saturate, which makes them insensitive to further changes in crop health. Therefore, the NDVI saturation phenomenon may lead to an underestimation of the extent of crop drought, as it is not effective in identifying subtle changes in crops under high-density vegetation conditions. Hence, we propose three novel triangular spectral indices for characterizing winter wheat drought using three features including LAI, Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and LST. For validating the proposed spectral indices, we compared the agreement between these indices with measured Relative Soil Moisture (RSM) and Volumetric Water Content (VWC) of soil in agricultural meteorological station and present popular indices including Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Temperature-Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). The results revealed that our proposed indices including Euclidean distance Crop Health Index (ECHI), Difference Crop Health Index (DCHI) and Perpendicular Water Stress Index (PWSI) outperformed the popular CWSI, TVDI and VHI, with stronger correlations with measured RSM and VWC in agricultural meteorological station. Secondly, there are spatial consistencies for characterizing winter wheat drought between proposed ECHI, DCHI and PWSI with popular CWSI, TVDI and VHI. In addition, our proposed ECHI, DCHI and PWSI have achieved good performance of drought monitoring both in irrigated and rainfed croplands. All these results suggest that our proposed indices have great potential in crop drought monitoring."

 Satellite-based field delineation has entered a quasi-operational stage due to recent advances in machine learning for computer vision. Transfer learning allows for the resource-efficient transfer of pre-trained field delineation models across heterogeneous geographies. However, the scarcity of labeled data for complex and dynamic smallholder landscapes remains a major bottleneck. The key innovation of this study is to overcome this challenge by using pre-trained models to generate sparse (i.e., not fully annotated) field delineation pseudo-labels for fine-tuning models across geographies and sensor characteristics. We build on a FracTAL ResUNet trained for crop field delineation in India (median field size of 0.24 ha) based on multi-spectral imagery at 1.5 m spatial resolution. We use this model to generate pseudo-labels for the use in Northern Mozambique (median field size of 0.06 ha) based on sub-meter resolution true-color satellite imagery. We designed multiple pseudo-label selection strategies based on field-level probability scores and compared the quantities, area properties, seasonal distribution, and spatial agreement of the pseudo-labels against human-annotated training labels (n = 1,512). We then used the human-annotated labels and the pseudo-labels for model fine-tuning and compared predictions against human field annotations (n = 2,199). We evaluated performance with regards to object-level spatial agreement and site-level field size estimation. Our results indicate i) a good baseline performance of the pre-trained model in both field delineation (mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.634) and field size estimation (mean root mean squared error (mRMSE) of 0.071 ha), and ii) the added value of regional fine-tuning with performance improvements in nearly all experiments (mIoU increases of up to 0.060, mRMSE decreases of up to 0.034 ha). Moreover, we found iii) substantial performance increases when using only pseudo-labels (up to 77 % of the mIoU increases and 68 % of the mRMSE decreases obtained by human-annotated labels), and iv) additional performance increases (mIoU+0.008, mRMSE: −0.003 ha) when complementing human annotations with pseudo-labels. Pseudo-labels are architecture-agnostic, can be efficiently generated at scale, and thus facilitate domain adaptation in label-scarce settings. The workflow presented here is a stepping stone for overcoming the persisting challenges in mapping heterogeneous smallholder agriculture."

However, common Fe(II)-activating oxidants including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and persulfate react slowly with Fe(II) and exhibit low selectivity for Fe(IV) production due to the cogeneration of radicals. Herein, we report peroxyacids (POAs; R–C(O)OOH) that can react with Fe(II) more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than H2O2, with high selectivity for Fe(IV) generation. Rapid degradation of bisphenol A (BPA, an endocrine disruptor) was achieved by the combination of Fe(II) with performic acid (PFA), peracetic acid (PAA), or perpropionic acid (PPA) within one second. Experiments with phenyl methyl sulfoxide (PMSO) and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) revealed Fe(IV) as the major reactive species in all three Fe(II)-POA systems, with a minor contribution of radicals (i.e., •OH and R–C(O)O•). To understand the exceptionally high reactivity of POAs, a detailed computational comparison among the Fenton-like reactions with step-by-step thermodynamic evaluation was conducted. The high reactivity is attributed to the lower energy barriers for O–O bond cleavage, which is determined as the rate-limiting step for the Fenton-like reactions, and the thermodynamically favorable bidentate binding pathway of POA with iron. Overall, this study advances knowledge on POAs as novel Fenton-like reagents and sheds light on computational chemistry for these systems."

The micropollutant elimination process underwent two phases: an initial slow degradation phase (0–10 min) followed by a rapid phase (10–20 min). Multiple evidence demonstrated that a PICA-Mn(IV) complex (PICA-Mn(IV)*) was generated, acting as a conductive bridge facilitating the electron transfer between PMS and micropollutants. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that PMS readily oxidized the PICA-Mn(II)* to PICA-Mn(IV)*. This intermediate then complexed with PMS to produce PICA-Mn(IV)-PMS*, elongating the O–O bond of PMS and increasing its oxidation capacity. The primary transformation mechanisms of typical micropollutants mediated by PICA-Mn(IV)-PMS* include oxidation, ring-opening, bond cleavage, and epoxidation reactions. The toxicity assessment results showed that most products were less toxic than the parent compounds. Moreover, the Mn(II)/PICA/PMS system showed resilience to water matrices and high efficiency in real water environments. Notably, PICA-Mn(IV)* exhibited greater stability and a longer lifespan than traditional reactive oxygen species, enabling repeated utilization.

However, the interactions of an organic contaminant with catalytic centers and participating ROS are complex and lack an in-depth understanding. In this work, we observed an abnormal phenomenon in AOPs that the degradation of electron-rich phenolics, such as 4-methoxyphenol, acetaminophen, and 4-presol, was unexpectedly slower than electron-deficient phenolics in a Mn(II)/nitrilotriacetic acid/peroxymonosulfate (Mn(II)/NTA/PMS) system. The established quantitative structure–activity relationship revealed a volcano-type dependence of the degradation rates on the Hammett constants of pollutants. Leveraging substantial analytical techniques and modeling analysis, we concluded that the electron-rich phenolics would inhibit the generation of both primary (Mn(III)NTA) and secondary (Mn(V)NTA) high-valent manganese species through complexation and competition effects. Specifically, the electron-rich phenolics would form a hydrogen bond with Mn(II)/NTA/PMS through outer-sphere interactions, thereby reducing the electrophilic reactivity of PMS to accept the electron transfer from Mn(II)NTA, and slowing down the generation of reactive Mn(III)NTA. Furthermore, the generated Mn(III)NTA is more inclined to react with electron-rich phenolics than PMS due to their higher reaction rate constants (8314 ± 440, 6372 ± 146, and 6919 ± 31 M–1 s–1 for 4-methoxyphenol, acetaminophen, and 4-presol, respectively, as compared with 671 M–1 s–1 for PMS). Consequently, the two-stage inhibition impeded the generation of Mn(V)NTA. In contrast, the complexation and competition effects are insignificant for electron-deficient phenolics, leading to declined reaction rates when the Hammett constants of pollutants increase. For practical applications, such complexation and competition effects would cause the degradation of electron-rich phenolics to be more susceptible to water matrixes, whereas the degradation of electron-deficient phenolics remains largely unaffected. Overall, this study elucidated the intricate interaction mechanisms between contaminants and reactive metal species at both the electronic and kinetic levels, further illuminating their implications for practical treatment."

We utilize high‐resolution large eddy simulations to investigate the impact of the changing surfaces onto the neutrally stratified atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). A stochastic surface model based on Gaussian Random Fields modeling typical permafrost landscapes is established in terms of two land cover classes: grass land and open water bodies, which exhibit different surface roughness length and surface sensible heat flux. A set of experiments is conducted where two parameters, the lake areal fraction and the surface correlation length, are varied to study the sensitivity of the boundary layer with respect to surface heterogeneity. Our key findings from the simulations are the following: The lake areal fraction has a substantial impact on the aggregated sensible heat flux at the blending height where surface heterogeneities become horizontally homogenized. The larger the lake areal fraction, the smaller the sensible heat flux. This result gives rise to a potential feedback mechanism. When the Arctic dries due to climate heating, the interaction with the ABL may accelerate permafrost thaw. Furthermore, the blending height shows significant dependency on the correlation length of the surface features. A longer surface correlation length causes an increased blending height. This finding is of relevance for land surface models concerned with Arctic permafrost as they usually do not consider a heterogeneity metric comparable to the surface correlation length."

We reproduced this incident using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) at a convection‐permitting resolution. We found that this case of tropical upper‐level turbulence occurred primarily due to the fast‐growing convective tower in the unstable layer created by gravity wave breaking. At lower altitudes, a mesoscale convective system (MCS) caused a decrease in wind speed in both upstream and downstream regions. At upper levels, a large‐scale jet descended and accelerated after flowing over the top of the MCS, which acted like a barrier and produced a situation similar to a downslope windstorm due to mountain terrain. Upper‐level turbulence is 2–3 km higher than the top of the MCS.

 The deleterious impact of antibiotics (ATB) on the microbiome negatively influences immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) response in patients with cancer. We conducted a randomized phase I study (EudraCT:2019-A00240-57) with 148 healthy volunteers (HV) to test two doses of DAV132, a colon-targeted adsorbent, alongside intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA), piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) or ceftriaxone (CRO) and a group without ATB. The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of DAV132 on ATB plasma concentrations and both doses of DAV132 did not alter ATB levels. Secondary objectives included safety, darkening of the feces, and fecal ATB concentrations. DAV132 was well tolerated, with no severe toxicity and similar darkening at both DAV132 doses. DAV132 led to significant decrease in CZA or PTZ feces concentration. When co-administered with CZA or PTZ, DAV132 preserved microbiome diversity, accelerated recovery to baseline composition and protected key commensals. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in preclinical cancer models in female mice from HV treated with CZA or PTZ alone inhibited anti–PD-1 response, while transplanted samples from HV treated with ATB + DAV132 circumvented resistance to anti–PD-1. This effect was linked to activated CD8+ T cell populations in the tumor microenvironment. DAV132 represents a promising strategy for overcoming ATB-related dysbiosis and further studies are warranted to evaluate its efficacy in cancer patients. The oral antibiotic adsorbent DAV132 can reduce fecal concentrations of antibiotics while preserving their pharmacokinetic properties.

This study presents a haplotype-based pangenome that uncovers substantial genetic diversity associated with climate adaptation and enables predictions of genetic vulnerability under future emission scenarios. 
 Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), an ecologically and economically important forest species in East Asia, plays vital roles in carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. However, intensifying climate change threatens moso bamboo survival. Here we generate high-quality haplotype-based pangenome assemblies for 16 representative moso bamboo accessions and integrated these assemblies with 427 previously resequenced accessions. Characterization of the haplotype-based pangenome reveals extensive genetic variation, predominantly between haplotypes rather than within accessions. Many genes with allele-specific expression patterns are implicated in climate responses. Integrating spatiotemporal climate data reveals more than 1050 variations associated with pivotal climate factors, including temperature and precipitation. Climate-associated variations enable the prediction of increased genetic risk across the northern and western regions of China under future emissions scenarios, underscoring the threats posed by rising temperatures. Our integrated haplotype-based pangenome elucidates moso bamboo’s local climate adaptation mechanisms and provides critical genomic resources for addressing intensifying climate pressures on this essential bamboo. More broadly, this study demonstrates the power of long-read sequencing in dissecting adaptive traits in climate-sensitive species, advancing evolutionary knowledge to support conservation.

 Virulence factor genes (VFGs) play pivotal roles in bacterial infections and have been identified within the human gut microbiota.

Further analyses of VFGs within the gut microbiomes of nine chronic diseases reveal both common and disease-specific VFG features. Notably, in type 2 diabetes patients, long HiFi sequencing confirms that shared VF features are carried by pathobiont strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

 We previously reported that normothermic ex vivo kidney  perfusion (NEVKP) is superior in terms of organ protection compared to static cold storage (SCS), which is still the standard method of organ preservation, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. We used a large animal kidney autotransplant model to evaluate mitochondrial function during organ preservation and after kidney transplantation, utilizing live cells extracted from fresh kidney tissue. Male porcine kidneys stored under normothermic perfusion showed preserved mitochondrial function and higher ATP levels compared to kidneys stored at 4 °C (SCS). Mitochondrial respiration and ATP levels were further enhanced when AP39, a mitochondria-targeted hydrogen sulfide donor, was administered during warm perfusion. Correspondingly, the combination of NEVKP and AP39 was associated with decreased oxidative stress and inflammation, and with improved graft function after transplantation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the organ-protective effects of normothermic perfusion are mediated by maintenance of mitochondrial function and enhanced by AP39 administration. Activation of mitochondrial function through the combination of AP39 and normothermic perfusion could represent a new therapeutic strategy for long-term renal preservation.

Here, authors show that preferred conformations of RyR2 variants linked either to heart failure or inherited sudden cardiac death are similar, suggesting a common cause and potential treatment. 
 Heart failure, the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed world, is characterized by cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 channels that are hyperphosphorylated, oxidized, and depleted of the stabilizing subunit calstabin-2. This results in a diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak that impairs cardiac contractility and triggers arrhythmias. Genetic mutations in ryanodine receptor 2 can also cause Ca2+ leak, leading to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Here, we solved the cryogenic electron microscopy structures of ryanodine receptor 2 variants linked either to heart failure or inherited sudden cardiac death. All are in the primed state, part way between closed and open. Binding of Rycal drugs to ryanodine receptor 2 channels reverts the primed state back towards the closed state, decreasing Ca2+ leak, improving cardiac function, and preventing arrhythmias. We propose a structural-physiological mechanism whereby the ryanodine receptor 2 channel primed state underlies the arrhythmias in heart failure and arrhythmogenic disorders.

 Controlling the formation and growth of ice is essential to successfully cryopreserve cells, tissues and biologics. Current efforts to identify materials capable of modulating ice growth are guided by iterative changes and human intuition, with a major focus on proteins and polymers. With limited data, the discovery pipeline is constrained by a poor understanding of the mechanisms and the underlying structure-activity relationships. In this work, this barrier is overcome by constructing machine learning models capable of predicting the ice recrystallisation inhibition activity of small molecules. We generate a new dataset via experimental measurements of ice growth, then harness predictive models combining state-of-the-art descriptors with domain-specific features derived from molecular simulations. The models accurately identify potent small molecule ice recrystallisation inhibitors within a commercial compound library. Identified hits can also mitigate cellular damage during transient warming events in cryopreserved red blood cells, demonstrating how data-driven approaches can be used to discover innovative cryoprotectants and enable next-generation cryopreservation solutions for the cold chain.

 Some communities endure environmental hazards from abandoned mines and job loss from the energy transition away from coal. Recent US legislation provides a historic appropriation for abandoned mine hazards like the acidic water that often drains from them. Who the investment will benefit and what it will accomplish is unclear. Here we provide answers for the case of abandoned mine drainage in Pennsylvania. We find that communities most exposed to mine drainage have incomes 30 percent below that of unaffected communities and are twice as vulnerable to the energy transition. Within affected communities, exposure is associated with a greater urban, non-white, renter population. Analytical modeling using data from past treatment efforts shows that they have been relatively cost effective, protecting streams for about $5700 per kilometer per year. Federal appropriations for Pennsylvania could address all impaired streams for 25 years but would leave insufficient funding for other abandoned mine hazards.

 High-quality land-use/land-cover mapping with optical remote sensing images yet presents significant work. Even though fully convolutional semantic segmentation models have recently contributed to popular solutions, the lack of annotation data may lead to severe degradations in their inference performance. Besides, the category confusion in high-resolution representations will further exacerbate the adverse effects. In this paper, we propose a category-sensitive semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework to address these weaknesses by employing massive unlabeled data. With the perturbations from adopted hybrid data augmentation structures, we first focus on the output space and execute regularization constraints to learn category-specific discriminative features. It is formulated with a consistency self-training procedure where a dynamic class-balanced threshold selection scheme is proposed to provide high-confident pseudo supervisions for each category. In addition, we introduce pixel-wise contrastive learning on the common embedding space from both labeled and unlabeled data domains to further facilitate the semantic dependencies among category features, in which the reliable labels are leveraged as guidance for pixel sample selection. We verify the proposed framework on two benchmark land-use/land-cover datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its competitive performance to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods."

During the outbreak of algal blooms, the near-infrared band reflectance evidently increased between 2009 and 2015, with increasing algal density. The algal density in the downstream of the Han River has a nearly synchronous positive change with the reflectance in the B4 (near-infrared) band and a nearly synchronous reverse change with the B1 (blue) band. B1 and B4 screened by GA reduced redundancy by 14%, leading to a good prediction performance (R2 = 0.88). According to GART and partial dependence analysis, the B4 band is a crucial characterization factor of algal blooms in the Han River. When the remote sensing band was in the range of B1 ⩾ 0.085 and B4 ⩽ 0.101, the algal density was lower than 0.15 × 107 cells l−1, indicating no algal bloom in the downstream of the Han River.

Results indicate positive impacts for hydropower generation and flood control, marginal benefits for water supply to existing irrigation, and negative consequences for brick production and the construction sector.

Here we examine wind variability in southeastern Australia in relation to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a dominant mode of atmospheric and oceanic variability for this region. The analysis covers variability from seasonal to diurnal timescales for both land and maritime regions of relevance to wind energy generation. Wind speeds were obtained from the 12 km grid length Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA) reanalysis, with a focus on wind at a typical hub-height of 100 m above the surface. Results show spatiotemporal variations in how ENSO influences wind speeds, including consistency in these variations over the wind speed distribution. For example, ENSO-related variations in mean winds were mostly similar in sign to ENSO-related variations in weak winds, noting uncertainties for strong winds given available data. Diurnal variability in wind speed was larger for summer than winter and for land than ocean regions, with the diurnal cycle maxima typically occurring in the afternoon and evening rather than morning, plausibly associated with sensible heating of air above land following solar radiation. Localised variations in the diurnal cycle were identified around mountains and coastal regions. The results show some indication of ENSO influences on the diurnal variability. These findings are intended to help enhance scientific understanding on wind variability, including in relation to ENSO, and to contribute information towards practical guidance in planning such as for use in energy sector applications."

The 30 min averaging period was insufficient to capture low-frequency fluxes. Time averaging of EC fluxes needs to be performed based on crop growth stage. 
 Direct measurement of carbon and water fluxes at high frequencies make eddy covariance (EC) the technique most preferred to characterize water use efficiency (WUE). However, reliability of EC fluxes largely hinges on the energy balance ratio (EBR) and inclusion of low-frequency fluxes. This study is aimed at investigating the role of the averaging period in representing EC fluxes and its propagation into WUE dynamics. Carbon and water fluxes were monitored in a drip-irrigated maize field at 10 Hz frequency and were averaged over 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min, considering daytime unstable conditions. The optimal averaging period to simulate WUE fluxes for each growth stage is obtained by considering cumulative frequency (Ogive) curves. A clear departure of EBR from unity was observed during the dough and maturity stages of the crop due to ignorance of canopy heat storage, low-frequency flux losses, and an inadequate averaging period. Deviations in representing water (carbon) fluxes relative to the conventional 30 min average are within ±3 % (±10 %) for 10–120 min averaging and beyond ±3 % (±10 %) for other time averages. Ogive plots show that the optimal averaging period to represent carbon, water, and WUE fluxes is 15–30 min for the sixth leaf and silking stages and is 45–60 min for the dough and maturity stages. Dynamics of WUE considering optimal averaging periods are in the range of μ ± σ: 1.49 ± 0.95, 1.37 ± 0.74, 1.39 ± 0.79, and 3.06 ± 0.69 µmol mmol−1 for the sixth leaf, silking, dough, and maturity stages, respectively. The error in representing WUE by conventional 30 min averaging is marginal (< 1.5 %) throughout the crop period except for the dough stage (12.12 %). We conclude that the conventional 30 min averaging of EC fluxes is not appropriate for representing WUE throughout the crop period. Our findings can help to develop efficient water management strategies by accurately characterizing WUE fluxes from the EC measurements."

The 2022 SASSIE campaign collected measurements of upper-ocean properties, including stratification (layering of the ocean) and air–sea fluxes in the Beaufort Sea. These data are presented here and made publicly available on the NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC), along with code to manipulate the data and generate the figures presented herein. 
 As our planet warms, Arctic sea ice coverage continues to decline, resulting in complex feedbacks with the climate system. The core objective of NASA's Salinity and Stratification at the Sea Ice Edge (SASSIE) mission is to understand how ocean salinity and near-surface stratification affect upper-ocean heat content and thus sea ice freeze and melt. SASSIE specifically focuses on the formation of Arctic Sea ice in autumn. The SASSIE field campaign in 2022 collected detailed observations of upper-ocean properties and meteorology near the sea ice edge in the Beaufort Sea using ship-based and piloted and drifting assets. The observations collected during SASSIE include vertical profiles of stratification up to the sea surface, air–sea fluxes, and ancillary measurements that are being used to better understand the role of salinity in coupled Arctic air–sea–ice processes. This publication provides a detailed overview of the activities during the 2022 SASSIE campaign and presents the publicly available datasets generated by this mission (available at https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SASSIE, last access: 29 May 2024; DOIs for individual datasets in the “Data availability” section), introducing an accompanying repository that highlights the numerical routines used to generate the figures shown in this work."

This study investigated the generational recruitment of microorganisms in different root niches of Vetiveria zizanioides (V. zizanioides) under arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) stress. The V. zizanioides was cultivated in As- and Sb-cocontaminated mine soils (MS) and artificial pollution soils (PS) over two generations in controlled conditions. The root-associated microbial communities were analyzed through 16S rRNA, arsC, and aioA gene amplicon and metagenomics sequencing. V. zizanioides accumulated higher As(III) and Sb(III) in its endosphere in MS in the second generation, while its physiological indices in MS were better than those observed in PS. SourceTracker analysis revealed that V. zizanioides in MS recruited As(V)- and Sb(V)-reducing microorganisms (e.g., Sphingomonales and Rhodospirillaceae) into the rhizoplane and endosphere. Metagenomics analysis further confirmed that these recruited microorganisms carrying genes encoding arsenate reductases with diverse carbohydrate degradation abilities were enriched in the rhizoplane and endosphere, suggesting their potential to reduce As(V) and Sb(V) and to decompose root exudates (e.g., xylan and starch). These findings reveal that V. zizanioides selectively recruits As- and Sb-reducing microorganisms to mitigate As–Sb cocontamination during the generational growth, providing insights into novel strategies for enhancing phytoremediation of metalloid-metal contaminants."

However, this can generate Hg-rich surfaces that facilitate microbial production of methylmercury (MeHg), a potent, bioaccumulative neurotoxin. Herein, we prove the concept that the risk of mercury methylation can be effectively minimized by adding sulfur-intercalated layered double hydroxide (S-LDH) to Hg-contaminated soils. Hg bound to S-LDH has minimal methylation potential when incubated with model methylating bacteria Pseudodesulfovibrio mercurii ND132 and Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA. With a combination of spectroscopic and microscopic evidence, as well as theoretical calculations, we confirm that dissolved Hg(II) tends to enter the interlayers of S-LDH to bind to the sulfur groups intercalated within, leading to the formation of nanoscale metacinnabar (β-HgS). This not only physically blocks the contact of methylating microorganisms but also inhibits secondary release of bound mercury in the presence of strong binding ligands in porewater. This study highlights the promising concept of in situ risk reduction of heavy metal contamination by inducing precipitation within (nano)confined domains, achieving a sustainable outcome of enhanced removal and reduced bioaccessibility for pollutants that may otherwise be bioavailable in the form of nanoprecipitates."

What remains elusive is how such metabolic constraints respond to dynamic flooding and drainage cycles characteristic of floodplain soils. Here we show that microbial depolymerization and respiration of organic compounds, two rate-limiting steps in decomposition, vary spatially and temporally with seasonal flooding of mountainous floodplain soils (Gothic, Colorado, USA). Combining metabolomics and -proteomics, we found a lower abundance of oxidative enzymes during flooding coincided with the accumulation of aromatic, high-molecular weight compounds, particularly in surface soils. In subsurface soils, we found that a lower oxidation state of carbon coincided with a greater abundance of chemically reduced, energetically less favorable low-molecular weight metabolites, irrespective of flooding condition. Our results suggest that seasonal flooding temporarily constrains oxidative depolymerization of larger, potentially plant-derived compounds in surface soils; in contrast, energetic constraints on microbial respiration persist in more reducing subsurface soils regardless of flooding. Our work underscores that the potential vulnerability of these distinct anaerobic carbon storage mechanisms to changing flooding dynamics should be considered, particularly as climate change  shifts both the frequency and extent of flooding in floodplains globally."

Benthic fluxes in these extreme habitats may enrich seawater with toxic metals such as mercury (Hg). We asked whether this phenomenon may lead to Hg accumulation in elasmobranchs. We thus analyzed total Hg (THg) in muscle, liver, and kidney tissues of oviparous Galeus melastomus catsharks and their embryos, which aggregate in vast numbers near deep-sea brine pools in the southeastern Mediterranean Sea. These Hg-rich brines (≤238 ng L–1) are a likely liable geogenic Hg source in this nursery. Shark tissues carried substantial THg [2.7 μg (g of wet weight)−1, median], and extreme values were found in kidneys [≤26.7 μg (g of wet weight)−1], likely due to environmental uptake. Increased THg in embryos [0.64 ± 0.31 μg (g of wet weight)−1] implies substantial maternal offloading (∼20%). Our results hint at the potential adaptation of elasmobranchs to Hg-enriched environments via accumulation and elimination of Hg in kidneys."

Planning for this requires an understanding of how the moons' internal structures—with and without oceans—relate to observable quantities. Here, we show that the amplitude of forced physical librations could be diagnostic of the presence or absence of subsurface oceans within the Uranian moons. In the presence of a decoupling global ocean, ice shell libration amplitudes at Miranda, Ariel, and Umbriel will exceed 100 m if the shells are <30 ${< } 30$ km $\mathrm{k}\mathrm{m}$ thick. The presence of oceans could also imply significant tidal heating within the last few hundred million years.

Warming results in an increase in mean dynamical TC intensity and moisture‐related quantities, with the latter being more pronounced. TC inner cores contract slightly but outer storm size remains unchanged. The frequency with which TCs become more intense is only moderately consistent, with snapshots having increased hazards ranging from 50% to 80% depending on warming level.

Here, the authors examine evolutionary convergence in the inner ear morphology of Afrotheria species and similar, non-Afrotheria analogue species, finding unexpectedly high evolvability. 
 Evolutionary convergence in distantly related species is among the most convincing evidence of adaptive evolution. The mammalian ear, responsible for balance and hearing, is not only characterised by its spectacular evolutionary incorporation of several bones of the jaw, it also varies considerably in shape across modern mammals. Using a multivariate approach, we show that in Afrotheria, a monophyletic clade with morphologically and ecologically highly disparate species, inner ear shape has evolved similar adaptations as in non-afrotherian mammals. We identify four eco-morphological trait combinations that underlie this convergence. The high evolvability of the mammalian ear is surprising: Nowhere else in the skeleton are different functional units so close together; it includes the smallest bones of the skeleton, encapsulated within the densest bone. We suggest that this evolvability is a direct consequence of the increased genetic and developmental complexity of the mammalian ear compared to other vertebrates. The inner ear is responsible for hearing and balance control.

Here, the authors report reservoir computing with magnetic skyrmions able to detect millisecond time-scale hand gestures, matching software neural networks’ performance. 
 Physical reservoir computing leverages the dynamical properties of complex physical systems to process information efficiently, significantly reducing training efforts and energy consumption. Magnetic skyrmions, topological spin textures, are promising candidates for reservoir computing systems due to their enhanced stability, non-linear interactions and low-power manipulation. Traditional spin-based reservoir computing has been limited to quasi-static detection or real-world data must be rescaled to the intrinsic timescale of the reservoir. We address this challenge by time-multiplexed skyrmion reservoir computing, that allows for aligning the reservoir’s intrinsic timescales to real-world temporal patterns. Using millisecond-scale hand gestures recorded with Range-Doppler radar, we feed voltage excitations directly into our device and detect the skyrmion trajectory evolution. This method scales down to the nanometer level and demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to energy-intensive software-based neural networks. Our hardware approach’s key advantage is its ability to integrate sensor data in real-time without temporal rescaling, enabling numerous applications.

Iron(III) dodecyl sulfate (Fe(DS)3) multi-lamellar vesicles (MLVs), a new growth template, are used to synthesize and direct the growth of the PEDOT:DS film via vapor-phase polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene to form huge PEDOT:DS co-crystal domains within the MLV superstructure. The polycrystalline film has metallic conductivity (avg. ~1.0 × 104 S cm−1), is highly transparent and mechanically durable yet flexible, and suitable for next-generation flexible electronics. These noteworthy properties are conferred by the MLV lamellar superstructure of Fe(DS)3, a selective oxidant and an efficient in situ dopant that enhances the film hydrophobicity and durability. Sophisticated MLV-type oxidants are foreseen to enable the synthesis of more conductive, transparent, robust, flexible, and water-stable polymer electrode materials in future. PEDOT:PSS is a conductive polymer with potential as electrodes in flexible electronics, but conductivity is not always satisfactory. Here, the authors report the use of dodecyl sulfate in place of polystyrene sulfonate to prepare a durable and conductive film with large crystal domains."

Here, the authors determined the cryo-EM structures of VMAT2, providing a structural basis for understanding VMAT2- mediated vesicular transport of neurotransmitters. 
 Human vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), a member of the SLC18 family, plays a crucial role in regulating neurotransmitters in the brain by facilitating their uptake and storage within vesicles, preparing them for exocytotic release. Because of its central role in neurotransmitter signalling and neuroprotection, VMAT2 is a target for neurodegenerative diseases and movement disorders, with its inhibitor being used as therapeutics. Despite the importance of VMAT2 in pharmacophysiology, the molecular basis of VMAT2-mediated neurotransmitter transport and its inhibition remains unclear. Here we show the cryo-electron microscopy structure of VMAT2 in the substrate-free state, in complex with the neurotransmitter dopamine, and in complex with the inhibitor tetrabenazine. In addition to these structural determinations, monoamine uptake assays, mutational studies, and pKa value predictions were performed to characterize the dynamic changes in VMAT2 structure. These results provide a structural basis for understanding VMAT2-mediated vesicular transport of neurotransmitters and a platform for modulation of current inhibitor design.

Here, a global map of 3D canopy complexity modeled from spaceborne lidar reveals that highly complex forests are concentrated in the tropics, with significant variations observed across biomes. 
 Forest structural complexity is a key element of ecosystem functioning, impacting light environments, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and habitat quality. Addressing the need for a comprehensive global assessment of actual forest structural complexity, we derive a near-global map of 3D canopy complexity using data from the GEDI spaceborne lidar mission. These data show that tropical forests harbor most of the high complexity observations, while less than 20% of temperate forests reached median levels of tropical complexity. Structural complexity in tropical forests is more strongly related to canopy attributes from lower and middle waveform layers, whereas in temperate forests upper and middle layers are more influential. Globally, forests exhibit robust scaling relationships between complexity and canopy height, but these vary geographically and by biome. Our results offer insights into the spatial distribution of forest structural complexity and emphasize the importance of considering biome-specific and fine-scale variations for ecological research and management applications. The GEDI Waveform Structural Complexity Index data product, derived from our analyses, provides researchers and conservationists with a single, easily interpretable metric by combining various aspects of canopy structure.

Seismic noise correlations yield a reflection matrix whose physics-based post-processing allows an optimized focusing through volcano heterogeneities. 
 Volcanic eruptions necessitate precise monitoring of magma pressure and inflation for improved forecasting. Understanding deep magma storage is crucial for hazard assessment, yet imaging these systems is challenging due to complex heterogeneities that disrupt standard seismic migration techniques. Here we map the magmatic and hydrothermal system of the La Soufrière volcano in Guadeloupe by analyzing seismic noise data from a sparse geophone array under a matrix formalism. Seismic noise interferometry provides a reflection matrix containing the signature of echoes from deep heterogeneities. Using wave correlations resistant to disorder, matrix imaging successfully unscrambles wave distortions, revealing La Soufrière’s internal structure down to 10 km with 100 m resolution. This method surpasses the diffraction limit imposed by geophone array aperture, providing crucial data for modeling and high-resolution monitoring. We see matrix imaging as a revolutionary tool for understanding volcanic systems and enhancing observatories’ abilities to monitor dynamics and forecast eruptions.

Since 2017, organized criminal groups (not smallholders) have been establishing coca plantations in Central America for cocaine production. This has broken South America’s long monopoly on coca leaf production for the global cocaine trade and raised concerns about future expansion in the isthmus. Yet it is not clear how much of Central America has suitable biophysical characteristics for a crop domesticated in, and long associated with the Andean region. We combine geo-located data from coca cultivation locations in Colombia with reported coca sites in Central America to model the soil, climate, and topography of Central American landscapes that might be suitable for coca production under standard management practices. We find that 47% of northern Central America (Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize) has biophysical characteristics that appear highly suitable for coca-growing, while most of southern Central America does not. Biophysical factors, then, are unlikely to constrain coca’s spread in northern Central America. Whether or not the crop is more widely planted will depend on complex and multi-scalar social, economic, and political factors. Among them is whether Central American countries and their allies will continue to prioritize militarized approaches to the drug trade through coca eradication and drug interdiction, which are likely to induce further expansion, not contain it. Novel approaches to the drug trade will be required to avert this outcome."

However, the alignment of SDG 6.3.2 monitoring requirements with CS capacity and results in low- or middle-income countries has not been assessed. Through a systematic literature review of 49 journal publications, complemented by 15 key informant interviews, this article examines the methods and outputs of CS programs in resource-constrained settings. We explore the potential of these programs to contribute to tracking SDG 6.3.2. Using the CS impact assessment framework, we evaluate broader outcomes of CS programs across 5 domains: society, economy, environment, governance, and science and technology. Despite large variability in scope, CS programs were consistently found to generate useful data for national-level reporting on physicochemical and ecological parameters; however, data quality is a concern for CS measurement of microbiological parameters. The focus in literature to-date is predominantly on scientific data production which falls only within the ‘science and technology’ outcome domain. Societal, governance, economic, and environmental outcomes are infrequently evaluated. Of the studies reviewed in this article, 75% identified some form of pollution but only 22% of them reported follow-up actions such as reporting to authorities.

Traditional view show that microbial residue C is more resistant to decompose than plant litter because their smaller particle sizes could be preferentially occluded in microaggregates with less microbial accessibility. However, we still lack a quantitative assessment (i.e. isotopic C labeling) to isolate the progressive release of C fractions from both plant and microbial residues. Here we used a global data set of 117 decomposition experiments that traced the 13C or 14C release of isotopically labeled plant and microbial residues to estimate the C release rates and turnover times by using a first-order exponential kinetics model. The average C release rates of crop, grass and tree litter were 7.78, 3.79 and 2.11 yr−1, which were significantly lower than microbial residues (13.07 yr−1). Although C release rates of both plant and microbial residues were positively correlated with site temperature, the mean turnover time of microbial residues was 2–6 times lower than plant litter. We suggest that a constraint in microbial and plant residues leads to a predictable pattern of C release during terrestrial decomposition, which could be included in Earth system models."

The majority narrative is that negative emissions technologies will have a bridging role in decarbonizing existing assets. Different models of deployment were proposed. Reaching the scale of deployment necessary to meet emissions targets is lengthy and expensive. Financial and regulatory risks are seen as greater barriers to deployment at scale than technological risk. Greater certainty regarding carbon pricing, production tax credits, and support for geological characterization and trunkline construction could reduce the former.

The effects of methanol and other frequently used carrier solvents on the chlorination rates of aromatic precursors of disinfection byproducts during water chlorination were investigated. At concentrations as low as 0.50 vol %, methanol increased chlorination rates of ethylparaben, phenol, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, ethyl 3-hydroxybenzoate, and ethyl 2-hydroxybenzoate. Methanol did not increase the chlorination rates of salicylic acid, dimethenamid, or 1,2-dimethoxybenzene. Ethylparaben and phenol chlorination were especially sensitive to methanol, with pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) increasing by a factor of >2 in water containing 2.0 vol % methanol compared to those in methanol-free controls. Rate enhancements persisted across differing reaction conditions (pH 6–10 and in buffers containing borate or phosphate). The rate enhancements of unsubstituted and para-substituted phenols were larger than those of meta- and ortho-substituted phenols. The carrier solvents acetone, acetonitrile, and tert-butanol had no appreciable impact on the chlorination rates of ethylparaben. Overall, our findings suggest that methanol as a carrier solvent can cause systematic errors in lab-scale chlorination experiments.

This study adopts a global ocean‐sea ice model to investigate the causes of this salinity rebound. Model‐based surface salinity budget analysis indicates that the salinity rebound was driven by increased brine rejection from sea ice formation, triggered by nearly equal effects of local anomalous winds and surface heat flux. The local divergent wind anomalies promoted local sea ice formation by creating a thin ice area, while cooling heat flux anomaly decreased the surface temperature, increasing sea ice production as well.

 Subduction-induced mantle flow has a considerable geodynamic impact on Earth. It can deflect mantle plumes, transport geochemical signatures and produce upwellings that generate atypical intraplate volcanism. The mantle flow produced by slab rollover subduction, however, remains unstudied, yet it may have a comparable geodynamic significance. Here, we present analogue models of buoyancy-driven subduction in which we image, using a state-of-the-art Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique, the three-dimensional mantle flow induced by two contrasting subduction styles: slab rollback (trench retreat) and slab rollover (trench advance). Our model results show that the advancing subduction mode develops a slab rollover geometry that generates a large-scale upwelling in a broad mantle wedge domain. Based on a comparison between the location of this upwelling and Cenozoic volcanics in Tibet, we propose that slab rollover subduction of the Tethyan and Indian slabs generated a comparably broad mantle upwelling, which drove widespread Cenozoic volcanism in Tibet. Intraplate volcanism inboard of subduction and collision zones, such as in Tibet during the Cenozoic, could be produced by reversed toroidal mantle flow and long-lived upwelling in subduction rollover settings, according to analogue subduction models."

 Mapping water bodies from remotely sensed imagery is crucial for understanding hydrological and biogeochemical processes. The identification of water extent is mainly dependent on optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, the use of remote sensing for water body mapping is often undermined by the mixed pixel dilemma inherent to traditional hard classification approaches. At the same time, the presence of clouds in optical imagery and speckle noise in SAR imagery, coupled with the difficulty in differentiating between water-like surfaces and actual water bodies, significantly compromise the accuracy of water body identification. This paper proposes a DEEP feature collaborative convolutional neural network (CNN) for Water Super-Resolution Mapping based on Optical and SAR images (DeepOSWSRM), which collaboratively leverages Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery to address the challenges of missing data and mixed pixels. The Sentinel-1 image provides complementary water distribution information for the cloudy areas of the Sentinel-2 image, while the Sentinel-2 image enhances the perception capabilities for small water bodies in the Sentinel-1 image. Using PlanetScope imagery as the true reference data, the effectiveness of the proposed method was assessed through two experimental scenarios: one utilizing synthetic coarse-resolution imagery degraded from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and another using actual Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, encompassing both simulated and real cloud conditions. A comparative analysis was conducted against three state-of-the-art CNN-based water mapping methods and two CNN SRM methods. The findings demonstrate that the proposed DeepOSWSRM method successfully produces accurate, fine-resolution water body maps, with its performance mainly benefiting from the fusion of SAR and optical images."

 Land surface emissivity (LSE) is a crucial variable in thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, providing unique information about the land surface across different channels. It is essential for applications such as surface energy budget estimation, resource exploration, and land cover change monitoring. However, current methods for retrieving LSE have certain limitations in terms of applicability or accuracy levels. Furthermore, the relative importance of various parameters in LSE retrieval studies remains unclear. To address these challenges, a practical and transferrable method has been proposed to retrieve LSE of different TIR channels using machine-learning technique. The proposed method uses visible and near-infrared (VNIR) as well as short-wave infrared (SWIR) data at the pixel scale to analyze key parameters for LSE retrieval and to estimate LSE for channels centered around 8.6 μm, 11.0 μm and 12.0 μm. Importance analysis identified crucial variables for LSE retrieval, including reflectivity in channels of SWIR3 (∼2.13 μm), RED (∼0.66 μm) and BLUE (∼0.47 μm), as well as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and the view zenith angle (VZ). Compared to the data used in existing methods, the core variables offer a more comprehensive representation of surface information, potentially enhancing both the accuracy and usability of the proposed method. Using these core variables, LSE was retrieved across eleven study areas through a machine learning method. Cross-validation with MODIS products showed that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the estimated LSE is 0.02 for the channel around 8.6 μm, and 0.01 for the channels around 11.0 μm and 12.0 μm, respectively. Direct-validation with in-situ measurements also demonstrated impressive retrieval accuracies in sandy areas. Furthermore, the model trained using 2019 data exhibited high retrieval accuracy when applied to data from 2017, highlighting its transferability across different time periods. Additionally, the proposed method produced promising results for LSE estimation using Landsat 8 imageries, indicating its potential for generating emissivity products from satellites with high spatial resolution but limited TIR channels."

 Detecting soil arsenic (As) contamination is crucial for designing efficient soil remediation strategies; however, traditional laboratory-based As detection techniques are time- and labour-intensive and are unsuitable for large-scale spatial analyses. To address this issue, we combined machine learning (ML) with visible-near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy to develop an efficient framework for As detection in soil. The optimal spectral preprocessing method was determined, and eight ML models were compared. The support vector classifier achieved optimal performance after subsequent hyperparameter tuning, with area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy values of 0.89 and 0.83, respectively. Important spectral bands at 471 and 2422 nm were identified by permutation importance and correspond to Fe-oxide and carbonate, respectively. These two wavelengths were included in the partial dependence plot (PDP), revealing that the likelihood of soil As contamination decreased with increasing reflectance at wavelengths of 471 and 2422 nm due to a decrease in Fe-oxide and carbonate content. Consistent with this finding, two-way PDP analysis revealed that the As content of soil increased with increasing Fe-oxide and carbonate content. The model’s classification performance was further improved using an ensemble technique based on three optimal ML models, resulting in increased AUC and accuracy values of 0.9 and 0.83, respectively. Overall, the framework presented in this study enabled the precise classification of soil As content at the continental scale, while also indirectly explained the complex relationships between As content and soil properties."

 The world is facing an unprecedented loss of biodiversity, with nearly one million species on the brink of extinction, and the extinction rate accelerating. Conservation efforts are often hindered by insufficient information on crucial ecosystems. To address this issue, our paper leverages advances in machine-based pattern recognition to estimate species occurrence maps using georeferenced data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Our algorithms have generated maps for more than 600,000 species, including vertebrates, arthropods, mollusks, other animals, vascular plants, fungi, and other organisms. Validation involved comparing these maps with expert maps for mammals, ants, and vascular plants. We found a close similarity in global distribution patterns, with regional differences attributed to technical variations or necessary revisions in existing expert maps based on GBIF data. As a practical application, we identified the global distributions of approximately 68,000 species with small ranges (25 km x 25 km or less) confined to a single country. Our maps reveal a skewed international distribution of these species, identifying 30 countries where 78.2 percent are concentrated. These results highlight the need to integrate the newly mapped GBIF data into global conservation planning. Our algorithms support rapid updates and the creation of new maps as GBIF occurrence reports increase.

Other potential applications of the new data include mineralisation, hydrology, food tracing, dust provenancing, and historic migrations of people and animals. 
 Strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) are widely used tracers in the geosciences. Here we exploit an opportunity to determine 87Sr/86Sr ratios on archived fluvial sediment samples from the low-density National Geochemical Survey of Australia. The present study targeted the Yilgarn Craton in southwestern Australia. One hundred and seven new samples were taken from a depth of ~ 60–80 cm in floodplain deposits at or near the outlet of large catchments (drainage basins). A coarse (< 2 mm) grain-size fraction was air-dried, sieved, milled then digested (hydrofluoric acid + nitric acid followed by aqua regia) to release total Sr. The Sr was then separated by chromatography and its 87Sr/86Sr ratio determined by multicollector-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results demonstrate a wide range of quite elevated Sr isotopic values (0.7152 to 1.0909, median 0.7560) over the survey area, reflecting a large diversity of source rock lithologies, geological processes and bedrock ages. Spatial distribution of 87Sr/86Sr shows coherent (multi-point anomalies and smooth gradients), large-scale (> 100 km) patterns that appear to be broadly consistent with surface geology, regolith/soil type, and/or nearby outcropping bedrock. The most radiogenic sediment values in the Yilgarn region (87Sr/86Sr > 0.8) all come from sites underlain by Archaean bedrock (2500–4000 Ma) and almost exclusively felsic intrusive lithologies. Conversely, almost all sites underlain by younger and non-granitic bedrock have outlet sediments of a less radiogenic character (87Sr/86Sr < 0.8). Sampling sites underlain by mafic and ultramafic bedrock yield unradiogenic Sr sediment signatures despite their Archaean age. Several sediment 87Sr/86Sr results were validated by comparison to previously published whole-rock data from their catchment, for both unradiogenic and radiogenic cases. The new Sr isotopic data are also interrogated in terms of the mineral occurrences (i.e., mineral deposits and/or operating mines) found in their catchment. Several catchments containing mineral resources across a range of commodities stand out as high 87Sr/86Sr outliers (87Sr/86Sr > 0.8), whilst over half of the registered mineral resources come from an intermediate, yet still elevated, catchment sediment 87Sr/86Sr range (87Sr/86Sr = 0.728–0.767). Avenues for future work are proposed, including a national-scale Sr isoscape for Australia. Such isoscape could be useful in future geological, forensic, archaeological, paleontological and ecological studies. The new spatial Sr isotope dataset for the southwestern Australia region is publicly available (de Caritat et al., 2024; https://dx.doi.org/10.26186/149755)."

 We introduce CAMELS-INDIA (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies – India), the hydrometeorological time series, and catchment attributes for 472 catchments in Peninsular India. Peninsular India covers 15 intrastate river basins defined by the Central Water Commission (CWC), where river flow and water level datasets are available for several gauge stations through the open-source India Water Resources Information System (India-WRIS). However, many of these gauge stations lack reliable metadata, and data are not in an analysis-ready format for large-sample hydrological studies. Therefore, we utilized 472 gauge stations and their catchment boundaries, characterized as stations with reliable metadata, from the 'Geospatial dataset for Hydrologic analyses in India (GHI)' (Goteti, 2023). For each of these catchments, the CAMELS-INDIA provides a catchment mean time series of meteorological forcings for 41 years (1980–2020) and around 211 catchment attributes representing hydroclimatic and land cover characteristics extracted from multiple data sources (including ground-based observations, remote sensing-based products, and reanalyses datasets). The CAMELS-INDIA follows the same standards of the previously developed CAMELS datasets for the USA, Chile, Brazil, Great Britain, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark to facilitate comparisons with catchments of those countries and inclusion in global hydrological studies. Notably, the CAMELS-INDIA includes available observed streamflow and catchment mean time series of 19 meteorological forcings, including precipitation, maximum, minimum, and average temperature, long-wave and short-wave radiation flux, U and V-components of wind, relative humidity, evaporation rates from canopy and soil surface, actual and potential evapotranspiration, and soil moisture of four layers (covering depth up to 3 m below ground) for detailed hydrometeorological studies. We also derived catchment attributes representing human influences, including the number of dams and their utilization, total volume contents of dams in catchments, population density, and increase in urban and agricultural land covers to facilitate studies to understand human influences on catchment hydrology. Furthermore, the dataset includes predicted streamflow time series from a regionally trained Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based hydrological model, which can fill gaps in observed streamflow data or serve as a benchmark for testing and developing new hydrological models. We envision that CAMELS-INDIA will provide a strong foundation for a community-led effort toward gaining new hydrological insights from hydrologically distinct Indian catchments and solving pertinent issues related to water management, quantification and risk assessment of hydrologic extremes, unraveling regional-scale hydrologic functioning, and climate change impact assessment of catchments across India.

Since remote sensing techniques cannot measure it directly, it is often deduced from volumetric water content (VWC) information. However, under dynamic field conditions, the relationship between SWP and VWC is highly ambiguous due to different factors that cannot be modeled with the classical approach. Applying a deep neural network with an autoencoder enables the prediction of the dynamic SWP. 
 Information on soil water potential is essential to assessing the soil moisture state, to prevent soil compaction in weak soils, and to optimize crop management. When there is a lack of direct measurements, the soil water potential values must be deduced from soil water content dynamics that can be monitored at the plot scale or obtained at a larger scale from remote sensing information. Because the relationship between water content and soil water potential in natural field soils is highly ambiguous, the prediction of soil water potential from water content data is a big challenge. The hysteretic relationship observed in nine soil profiles in the region of Solothurn (Switzerland) is not a simple function of texture or wetting–drainage cycles but depends on seasonal patterns that may be related to soil structural dynamics. Because the physical mechanisms governing seasonal hysteresis are unclear, we developed a deep neural network model that predicts water potential changes using rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and water content time series as inputs. To adapt the model for multiple locations, we incorporated a deep autoencoder neural network as a classifier. The autoencoder compresses the water content time series into a site-specific feature that is highly representative of the underlying water content dynamics of each site and quantifies the similarity of dynamic patterns. By adding the autoencoder's output as an additional input and training the neural network model with three stations located in three major classes established by the autoencoder, we predict matric potential for other sites. This method has the potential to deduce the dynamics of matric potential from water content data (including satellite data) despite strong seasonal effects that cannot be captured by standard methods."

This model shows improved performance in capturing the general crop growth, such as crop stages, biomass, crop yield, and vegetation greenness. 
 Irrigated cultivation exerts a significant influence on the local climate and the hydrological cycle. The North China Plain (NCP) is known for its intricate agricultural system, marked by expansive cropland, high productivity, compact rotation, a semi-arid climate, and intensive irrigation practices. As a result, there has been considerable attention on the potential impact of this intensive irrigated agriculture on the local climate. However, studying the irrigation impact in this region has been challenging due to the lack of an accurate simulation of crop phenology and irrigation practices within the climate model. By incorporating double cropping with interactive irrigation, our study extends the capabilities of the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model, which has previously demonstrated commendable performance in simulating single-cropping scenarios. This allows for two-way feedback between irrigated crops and climate, further enabling the inclusion of irrigation feedback from both ground and vegetation perspectives. The improved crop modeling system shows significant enhancement in capturing vegetation and irrigation patterns, which is evidenced by its ability to identify crop stages, estimate field biomass, predict crop yield, and project monthly leaf area index.

It enables to accept or reject scenarios within a predefined confidence interval. In particular, it can allow to estimate the probability of a fault acting as a preferential path or a barrier. 
 Groundwater contaminant transport problems remain challenging with respect to their computing requirements. Thus, it often limits the exploration of conceptual uncertainty, that is mainly related to large scale structural features and due to limited characterization. Here, to facilitate geological conceptual uncertainty exploration, we develop further the use of graph representation for geological models to approximate groundwater flow and transport. We consider a faulted multi-heterogeneous-layer medium to test our approach. The existing rank correlation between shortest path distribution from a contaminant source to the model domain outlet and cumulative mass distribution at the outlet enables to perform scenario selection. The scenario selection approach relies on a metric combining the Jaccard dissimilarity and the Wasserstein distance to compare binary images. Among a set combining eight alternative scenarios, where three faults can either act as a flow barrier or a preferential path, we show that the use of graph-approximations allows to retain or reject scenarios with confidence as well as to estimate the individual probability of a fault to act as a barrier or a path. This methodology framework opens up possibilities to explore more thoroughly conceptual geological uncertainty for processes affected by flow and transport."

N2O reductase (N2OR) is the primary N2O sink, but the distribution of its gene clades, typically nosZI and atypically nosZII, along urbanization gradients remains poorly understood. Here we sampled soils from forests, parks, and farmland across eight provinces in eastern China, using high-throughput sequencing to distinguish between two N2O-reducing bacteria clades. A deterministic process mainly determined assemblies of the nosZI communities. Homogeneous selection drove nosZI deterministic processes, and both homogeneous and heterogeneous selection influenced nosZII. This suggests nosZII is more sensitive to environmental changes than nosZI, with significant changes in community structure over time or space. Ecosystems with stronger anthropogenic disturbance, such as urban areas, provide diverse ecological niches for N2O-reducing bacteria (especially nosZII) to adapt to environmental fluctuations. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and correlation analyses revealed that pH significantly influences the community composition of both N2O-reducing bacteria clades. This study underscores urbanization’s impact on N2O-reducing bacteria in urban soils, highlighting the importance of nosZII and survival strategies. It offers novel insights into the role of atypical denitrifiers among N2O-reducing bacteria, underscoring their potential ecological importance in mitigating N2O emissions from urban soils."

Considering that industrial wastewater is usually treated in a decentralized manner, in situ utilization of chemical energy to achieve waste-to-treasure should be given priority. Herein, the chemical energy released by the electroreduction of Cr(VI) was used to enhance on-site H2O2 generation in a stacked flow-through electrochemical system. The driving force of water flow efficiently coupled O2 evolution with 2-e O2 reduction to facilitate H2O2 generation by transporting anode-produced O2 to the cathode. Meanwhile, the chemical energy released by Cr(VI) promoted O2 evolution and impeded H2 evolution by regulating the electrode potentials, accounting for the enhanced H2O2 generation. The system could completely reduce 10–100 ppm of Cr(VI), reaching the maximum H2O2 concentration of 2.41 mM. In particular, the H2O2 concentrations in the Cr(VI)-containing electrolyte were 10.6–88.1% higher than those in the Cr(VI) free electrolyte at 1.8–2.5 V. A 24-day continuous experiment demonstrated the high efficiency and stability of the system, achieving a 100% reduction efficiency for 100 ppm of Cr(VI) and producing ∼1.5 mM H2O2 at 1.8 V. This study presents a feasible strategy for Cr(VI) detoxification and synchronous on-site H2O2 generation, providing a new perspective for innovative Cr(VI) wastewater treatment toward resource utilization."

Artificial light at night (ALAN) can disrupt natural sleep–wake cycles, whereas chemical pollutants can impair sleep-related processes. The prevalence of ALAN increases the health risk of coexposure, yet it has not gained sufficient attention. Meanwhile, visual inputs are important for sleep regulation, especially the non-image-forming circadian visual system centered around melanopsin. This study evaluated the light perception ability and sleep performance of zebrafish larvae exposed to flame retardant hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) at environmentally relevant concentrations (2.5 and 25 μg/L) and to cotreatment of HBCD and ALAN. HBCD induced a longer sleep latency of 34.59 min under 25 μg/L (p < 0.01) versus control (26.04 min). The situation was intensified by coexposure with low-level ALAN (10 lx) to 48.04 min. Similar synergic effects were observed for upregulations of Xenopus-related melanopsin genes and downregulations of the melatonin synthesis gene aanat2, suggesting a melanopsin–aanat2–sleep retina–brain pathway. Image-forming opsins (opn1sw1 and opn1sw2) were also activated by HBCD to 1.29–1.53-fold (p < 0.05), together with elevated retina glutamate, but without synergic effects.

However, the floor dust-borne microbiome is commonly used as a proxy for indoor airborne microbiome, and the spatial distribution of indoor airborne microbiome is less well understood. This study aimed to characterize indoor airborne microorganisms at varying heights and compare them with those in floor dust. An assembly of three horizontally and three vertically positioned Petri dishes coated with mineral oil was applied for passive air sampling continuously at three heights without interruption. The airborne microbiomes at the three different heights showed slight stratification and differed significantly from those found in the floor dust. Based on the apportionment results from the fast expectation–maximization algorithm (FEAST), shoe sole dust contributed approximately 4% to indoor airborne bacteria and 14% to airborne fungi, a contribution that is comparable to that from the floor dust-borne microbiome. The results indicated that floor dust may not be a reliable proxy for indoor airborne microbiome. Moreover, the study highlights the need for height-resolved studies of indoor airborne microbiomes among humans in different activity modes and life states. Additionally, shoe sole-dust-associated microorganisms could potentially be a source to “re-wild” the indoor microbiota."

However, precise regulation of such reactions is still restricted by our poor knowledge of underlying mechanisms, especially the correlation between metal site conformation of metal atom clusters and pollutant degradation behaviors. Herein, we investigated the electron transfer and pollutant oxidation mechanisms of atomic-level exposed Ag atom clusters (AgAC) loaded on specifically crafted nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC). The AgAC triggered a direct electron transfer (DET) between the terminal oxygen (Oα) of surface-activated peroxodisulfate and the electron-donating substituents-containing contaminants (EDTO–DET), rendering it 11–38 times higher degradation rate than the reported carbon-supported metal catalysts system with various single-atom active centers. Heterocyclic substituents and electron-donating groups were more conducive to degradation via the EDTO–DET system, while contaminants with high electron-absorbing capacity preferred the radical pathway. Notably, the system achieved 79.5% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal for the treatment of actual pharmaceutical wastewater containing 1053 mg/L COD within 30 min.

We developed a targeted, long-read sequencing method utilizing unique molecular identifiers to generate accurate, full length CTX-M gene sequences from wastewater. We characterized CTX-M in Seattle area wastewater influent from April 2020 to March 2021. We identified a core community of alleles that persisted across time and treatment plant. The CTX-M-15 containing protein variant (CTX-M-15/216/28) was detected in all but three samples and made up, at most, 30% of CTX-M alleles. We observed significant diversity across the CTX-M gene at the nucleic acid level, although most nucleotide mutations were synonymous─resulting in two to three amino acid variants across 19 loci. By average relative abundance, 23% of protein variants were novel, defined as those not represented in CARD. This method provides full length gene sequences that cannot be obtained through other culture-independent methods.

BHPF exhibits antiestrogenic effects and potential reproductive toxicity. Similar to BPA, BHPF can closely access the active site of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme, interact with the Fe═O moiety, and potentially initiate metabolic reactions. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored the mechanisms underlying BHPF activation using a CYP450 compound I (Cpd I) model, identifying several plausible products. Compared with the higher energy barriers associated with phenyl ring addition reactions, the formation of a phenoxyl-type radical through phenolic hydrogen atom abstraction, followed by OH rebound or radical coupling, represents an energetically favorable pathway. The OH rebound process yields three primary products: 9-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-9-(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene (PRD1), semiquinone radical anion (PRD2), and 9-(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene carbocation (PRD3), constituting the major outcomes of the BHPF metabolic reaction. Importantly, a lipophilic ether metabolite, BHPF-O-BHPF (PRD4), formed through the coupling of phenoxyl radicals, reflects a widespread metabolic pathway observed in phenolic molecules. Despite constituting a minor proportion, the toxicity of this product necessitates increased attention.

The studies of two different point‐source models, the seismic moment tensor (MT) and the single force (SF), have been performed separately for this eruption, which, interestingly, can explain the seismic data adequately. Here, we use a joint inversion of MT and SF to unravel a composite source of an explosion‐like MT and a significant upward force for the first major explosive event. Regarding the direction and magnitude, we propose that the upward force is likely a rebound force in response to the pressure drop on the seafloor because the water body above the volcano was abruptly uplifted by the shallow underwater explosion."

The evolution of medium‐lived RCCREs is generally dominated by the 10–30‐day ISO, while the 10–30‐day and 30–90‐day ISOs synergistically contribute to the occurrence of long‐lived RCCREs. Further analysis reveals that, when the East Asian westerly jet (EAWJ) shifts northward to the north of YHRV, a RCCRE in the YHRV occurs in 2 days later. In the medium‐lived RCCREs, the EAWJ retreats southward rapidly; while in the long‐lived RCCREs, the stronger 30–90‐day ISO prevents the southward retreat of EAWJ, which favors the persistence of the RCCREs in the YHRV. The northward shifted EAWJ facilitates the RCCREs by modulating the secondary atmospheric circulation, consequently enhancing the moisture convergence and ascending motion anomalies over the YHRV. The RCCREs‐related precursor wave train originates from northern Europe with at least a 4‐day lead. The wave train propagates southeastward to excite an anomalous high over East Asia, which contributes to the northward shift of EAWJ and subsequently the occurrence of RCCREs. Different from the rapid weakness of the precursor wave train associated with the medium‐lived RCCREs, the precursor wave train associated with the long‐lived RCCREs can be maintained by the 30–90‐day ISO, which consequently leads to a persistence of the northward located EAWJ and long‐lived RCCREs in the YHRV."

These moving hillslopes can inflict damage to buildings and infrastructure, accelerate with urban alterations, and catastrophically fail with climatic and weather extremes. Yet, systematic estimates of slow‐moving landslide exposure and their drivers have been elusive. Here, we present a new global database of 7,764 large (A ≥ 0.1 km2) slow‐moving landslides across nine IPCC regions. Using high‐resolution human settlement footprint data, we identify 563 inhabited landslides. We estimate that 9% of reported slow‐moving landslides are inhabited, in a given basin, and have 12% of their areas occupied by human settlements, on average. We find the density of settlements on unstable slopes decreases in basins more affected by slow‐moving landslides, but varies across regions with greater flood exposure. Across most regions, urbanization can be a relevant driver of slow‐moving landslide exposure, while steepness and flood exposure have regionally varying influences. In East Asia, slow‐moving landslide exposure increases with urbanization, gentler slopes, and less flood exposure. Our findings quantify how disparate knowledge creates uncertainty that undermines an assessment of the drivers of slow‐moving landslide exposure in mountain regions, facing a future of rising risk, such as Central Asia, Northeast Africa, and the Tibetan Plateau."

 Tissue-selective chemoattractants direct lymphocytes to epithelial surfaces to establish local immune environments, regulate immune responses to food antigens and commensal organisms, and protect from pathogens. Homeostatic chemoattractants for small intestines, colon, and skin are known1 2, but chemotropic mechanisms selective for respiratory tract and other non-intestinal mucosal tissues (NIMT) remain poorly understood. Here we leveraged diverse omics datasets to identify GPR25 as a lymphocyte receptor for CXCL17, a chemoattractant cytokine whose expression by epithelial cells of airways, upper gastrointestinal and squamous mucosae unifies the NIMT and distinguishes them from intestinal mucosae. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses show that GPR25 is induced on innate lymphocytes prior to emigration to the periphery, and is imprinted in secondary lymphoid tissues on activated B and T cells responding to immune challenge. GPR25 characterizes B and T tissue resident memory and regulatory T lymphocytes in NIMT and lungs in humans and mediates lymphocyte homing to barrier epithelia of the airways, oral cavity, stomach, biliary and genitourinary tracts in mouse models. GPR25 is also expressed by T cells in cerebrospinal fluid and CXCL17 by neurons, suggesting a role in CNS immune regulation. We reveal widespread imprinting of GPR25 on regulatory T cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to population genetic evidence that GPR25 is protective in autoimmunity3,4. Our results define a GPR25-CXCL17 chemoaffinity axis with the potential to integrate immunity and tolerance at non-intestinal mucosae and the CNS."

 The development of superconducting qubit technology has shown great potential for the construction of practical quantum computers1,2. As the complexity of quantum processors continues to grow, the need for stringent fabrication tolerances becomes increasingly critical3. Utilizing advanced industrial fabrication processes could facilitate the necessary level of fabrication control to support the continued scaling of quantum processors. However, at present, these industrial processes are not optimized to produce high-coherence devices, nor are they a priori compatible with the approaches commonly used to make superconducting qubits.

We show across-wafer, large-scale statistics of coherence, yield, variability and ageing that confirm the validity of our approach. The presented industry-scale fabrication process, which uses only optical lithography and reactive-ion etching, has a performance and yield in line with conventional laboratory-style techniques utilizing metal lift-off, angled evaporation and electron-beam writing4. Moreover, it offers the potential for further upscaling through three-dimensional integration5 and more process optimization.

 Studies of moiré systems have explained the effect of superlattice modulations on their properties, demonstrating new correlated phases1. However, most experimental studies have focused on a few layers in two-dimensional systems. Extending twistronics to three dimensions, in which the twist extends into the third dimension, remains underexplored because of the challenges associated with the manual stacking of layers. Here we study three-dimensional twistronics using a self-assembled twisted spiral superlattice of multilayered WS2. Our findings show an opto-twistronic Hall effect driven by structural chirality and coherence length, modulated by the moiré potential of the spiral superlattice. This is an experimental manifestation of the noncommutative geometry of the system. We observe enhanced light–matter interactions and an altered dependence of the Hall coefficient on photon momentum. Our model suggests contributions from higher-order quantum geometric quantities to this observation, providing opportunities for designing quantum-materials-based optoelectronic lattices with large nonlinearities.

 Persistent colonization and outgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms in the intestine can result from long-term antibiotic use or inflammatory conditions, and may perpetuate dysregulated immunity and tissue damage1,2. Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae gut pathobionts are particularly recalcitrant to conventional antibiotic treatment3,4, although an emerging body of evidence suggests that manipulation of the commensal microbiota may be a practical alternative therapeutic strategy5–7. Here we isolated and down-selected commensal bacterial consortia from stool samples from healthy humans that could strongly and specifically suppress intestinal Enterobacteriaceae. One of the elaborated consortia, comprising 18 commensal strains, effectively controlled ecological niches by regulating gluconate availability, thereby re-establishing colonization resistance and alleviating Klebsiella- and Escherichia-driven intestinal inflammation in mice. Harnessing these activities in the form of live bacterial therapies may represent a promising solution to combat the growing threat of proinflammatory, antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infection.

 Metallurgical production traditionally involves three steps: extracting metals from ores, mixing them into alloys by liquid processing and thermomechanical processing to achieve the desired microstructures1,2. This sequential approach, practised since the Bronze Age, reaches its limit today because of the urgent demand for a sustainable economy2–5: almost 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are because of the use of fossil reductants and high-temperature metallurgical processing. Here we present a H2-based redox synthesis and compaction approach that reforms traditional alloy-making by merging metal extraction, alloying and thermomechanical processing into one single solid-state operation. We propose a thermodynamically informed guideline and a general kinetic conception to dissolve the classical boundaries between extractive and physical metallurgy, unlocking tremendous sustainable bulk alloy design opportunities. We exemplify this approach for the case of Fe–Ni invar bulk alloys6,7, one of the most appealing ferrous materials but the dirtiest to produce: invar shows uniquely low thermal expansion6,8,9, enabling key applications spanning from precision instruments to cryogenic components10–13. Yet, it is notoriously eco-unfriendly, with Ni causing more than 10 times higher CO2 emission than Fe per kilogram production2,14, qualifying this alloy class as a perfect demonstrator case. Our sustainable method turns oxides directly into green alloys in bulk forms, with application-worthy properties, all obtained at temperatures far below the bulk melting point, while maintaining a zero CO2 footprint.

 The developing placenta, which in mice originates through the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE), is essential for mammalian embryonic development. Yet unbiased characterization of the differentiation dynamics of the ExE and its interactions with the embryo proper remains incomplete. Here we develop a temporal single-cell model of mouse gastrulation that maps continuous and parallel differentiation in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages. This is matched with a three-way perturbation approach to target signalling from the embryo proper, the ExE alone, or both. We show that ExE specification involves early spatial and transcriptional bifurcation of uncommitted ectoplacental cone cells and chorion progenitors. Early BMP4 signalling from chorion progenitors is required for proper differentiation of uncommitted ectoplacental cone cells and later for their specification towards trophoblast giant cells. We also find biphasic regulation by BMP4 in the embryo. The early ExE-originating BMP4 signal is necessary for proper mesoendoderm bifurcation and for allantois and primordial germ cell specification. However, commencing at embryonic day 7.5, embryo-derived BMP4 restricts the primordial germ cell pool size by favouring differentiation of their extraembryonic mesoderm precursors towards an allantois fate. ExE and embryonic tissues are therefore entangled in time, space and signalling axes, highlighting the importance of their integrated understanding and modelling in vivo and in vitro.

 The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway guides the DNA methylation of young, active transposons during germline development in male mice1. piRNAs tether the PIWI protein MIWI2 (PIWIL4) to the nascent transposon transcript, resulting in DNA methylation through SPOCD1 (refs. 2–5). Transposon methylation requires great precision: every copy needs to be methylated but off-target methylation must be avoided. However, the underlying mechanisms that ensure this precision remain unknown. Here, we show that SPOCD1 interacts directly with SPIN1 (SPINDLIN1), a chromatin reader that primarily binds to H3K4me3-K9me3 (ref. 6). The prevailing assumption is that all the molecular events required for piRNA-directed DNA methylation occur after the engagement of MIWI2. We find that SPIN1 expression precedes that of both SPOCD1 and MIWI2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that young LINE1 copies, but not old ones, are marked by H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and SPIN1 before the initiation of piRNA-directed DNA methylation. We generated a Spocd1 separation-of-function allele in the mouse that encodes a SPOCD1 variant that no longer interacts with SPIN1. We found that the interaction between SPOCD1 and SPIN1 is essential for spermatogenesis and piRNA-directed DNA methylation of young LINE1 elements. We propose that piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation requires a developmentally timed two-factor authentication process. The first authentication is the recruitment of SPIN1–SPOCD1 to the young LINE1 promoter, and the second is MIWI2 engagement with the nascent transcript. In summary, independent authentication events underpin the precision of piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation. In male mouse germline development, the precise DNA methylation of young, active transposons requires a two-step process in which SPIN1 and SPOCD1 mark young LINE1 elements before the piRNA pathway triggers DNA methylation."

 Materials with hierarchical architectures that combine soft and hard material domains with coalesced interfaces possess superior properties compared with their homogeneous counterparts1–4. These architectures in synthetic materials have been achieved through deterministic manufacturing strategies such as 3D printing, which require an a priori design and active intervention throughout the process to achieve architectures spanning multiple length scales5–9. Here we harness frontal polymerization spin mode dynamics to autonomously fabricate patterned crystalline domains in poly(cyclooctadiene) with multiscale organization. This rapid, dissipative processing method leads to the formation of amorphous and semi-crystalline domains emerging from the internal interfaces generated between the solid polymer and the propagating cure front. The size, spacing and arrangement of the domains are controlled by the interplay between the reaction kinetics, thermochemistry and boundary conditions. Small perturbations in the fabrication conditions reproducibly lead to remarkable changes in the patterned microstructure and the resulting strength, elastic modulus and toughness of the polymer. This ability to control mechanical properties and performance solely through the initial conditions and the mode of front propagation represents a marked advancement in the design and manufacturing of advanced multiscale materials.

 Entanglement is a key feature of quantum mechanics1–3, with applications in fields such as metrology, cryptography, quantum information and quantum computation4–8. It has been observed in a wide variety of systems and length scales, ranging from the microscopic9–13 to the macroscopic14–16. However, entanglement remains largely unexplored at the highest accessible energy scales. Here we report the highest-energy observation of entanglement, in top–antitop quark events produced at the Large Hadron Collider, using a proton–proton collision dataset with a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 140 inverse femtobarns (fb)−1 recorded with the ATLAS experiment. Spin entanglement is detected from the measurement of a single observable D, inferred from the angle between the charged leptons in their parent top- and antitop-quark rest frames. The observable is measured in a narrow interval around the top–antitop quark production threshold, at which the entanglement detection is expected to be significant. It is reported in a fiducial phase space defined with stable particles to minimize the uncertainties that stem from the limitations of the Monte Carlo event generators and the parton shower model in modelling top-quark pair production. The entanglement marker is measured to be D = −0.537 ± 0.002 (stat.) ± 0.019 (syst.) for

              . The observed result is more than five standard deviations from a scenario without entanglement and hence constitutes the first observation of entanglement in a pair of quarks and the highest-energy observation of entanglement so far. Entanglement was observed in top–antitop quark events by the ATLAS experiment produced at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN using a proton–proton collision dataset with a centre-of-mass energy of √s  = 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 140 fb−1."

 When sustained for megayears (refs. 1,2), high-power jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) become the largest galaxy-made structures in the Universe3. By pumping electrons, atomic nuclei and magnetic fields into the intergalactic medium (IGM), these energetic flows affect the distribution of matter and magnetism in the cosmic web4–6 and could have a sweeping cosmological influence if they reached far at early epochs. For the past 50 years, the known size range of black hole jet pairs ended at 4.6–5.0 Mpc (refs. 7–9), or 20–30% of a cosmic void radius in the Local Universe10. An observational lack of longer jets, as well as theoretical results11, thus suggested a growth limit at about 5 Mpc (ref. 12). Here we report observations of a radio structure spanning about 7 Mpc, or roughly 66% of a coeval cosmic void radius, apparently generated by a black hole between

 Although a ubiquitous natural phenomenon, the onset and subsequent process of surface wave breaking are not fully understood. Breaking affects how steep waves become and drives air–sea exchanges1. Most seminal and state-of-the-art research on breaking is underpinned by the assumption of two-dimensionality, although ocean waves are three dimensional. We present experimental results that assess how three-dimensionality affects breaking, without putting limits on the direction of travel of the waves. We show that the breaking-onset steepness of the most directionally spread case is double that of its unidirectional counterpart. We identify three breaking regimes. As directional spreading increases, horizontally overturning ‘travelling-wave breaking’ (I), which forms the basis of two-dimensional breaking, is replaced by vertically jetting ‘standing-wave breaking’ (II). In between, ‘travelling-standing-wave breaking’ (III) is characterized by the formation of vertical jets along a fast-moving crest. The mechanisms in each regime determine how breaking limits steepness and affects subsequent air–sea exchanges. Unlike in two dimensions, three-dimensional wave-breaking onset does not limit how steep waves may become, and we produce directionally spread waves 80% steeper than at breaking onset and four times steeper than equivalent two-dimensional waves at their breaking onset. Our observations challenge the validity of state-of-the-art methods used to calculate energy dissipation and to design offshore structures in highly directionally spread seas. We conduct experiments in a wave tank and show that waves with realistic three-dimensional spreading can become two times steeper than two-dimensional waves before breaking, with three breaking regimes identified."

Edmonds,Rules of river avulsion change downstream,"A novel theoretical framework reveals how topography surrounding rivers causes dramatic changes in their courses, with implications for natural hazard prediction, particularly in the Global South. 
 Avulsing rivers create new pathways on the floodplain and the associated flooding can profoundly affect society1–4. River avulsions are thought to occur when the water column becomes perched above the floodplain5 or when the slope down the flanks of the channel provides a steeper descent than the existing river channel6,7. We test these classical ideas by quantifying the topography around avulsing rivers and show that these mechanisms, historically invoked separately, work together. Near coasts, rivers avulse when the slope away from the channel is steeper, not because they are perched. The opposite is true near mountain fronts; on fans, the alternative paths are similarly steep to the downstream path, so rivers avulse when they are perched above the surrounding landscape. We reconcile these findings and present a new theoretical framework that identifies which rivers are vulnerable to avulsion and predicts the path of an avulsing river. These first-order rules of avulsion suggest that avulsion risks are underestimated in many coastal environments8 and that probabilistic predictions of avulsion pathfinding can efficiently map hazards with minimal information. Applying these principles for risk assessment could particularly benefit the Global South, which is disproportionately affected by avulsions. A novel theoretical framework reveals how topography surrounding rivers causes dramatic changes in their courses, with implications for natural hazard prediction, particularly in the Global South."

 Micronuclear batteries harness energy from the radioactive decay of radioisotopes to generate electricity on a small scale, typically in the nanowatt or microwatt range1,2. Contrary to chemical batteries, the longevity of a micronuclear battery is tied to the half-life of the used radioisotope, enabling operational lifetimes that can span several decades3. Furthermore, the radioactive decay remains unaffected by environmental factors such as temperature, pressure and magnetic fields, making the micronuclear battery an enduring and reliable power source in scenarios in which conventional batteries prove impractical or challenging to replace4. Common radioisotopes of americium (241Am and 243Am) are α-decay emitters with half-lives longer than hundreds of years. Severe self-adsorption in traditional architectures of micronuclear batteries impedes high-efficiency α-decay energy conversion, making the development of α-radioisotope micronuclear batteries challenging5,6. Here we propose a micronuclear battery architecture that includes a coalescent energy transducer by incorporating 243Am into a luminescent lanthanide coordination polymer. This couples radioisotopes with energy transducers at the molecular level, resulting in an 8,000-fold enhancement in energy conversion efficiency from α decay energy to sustained autoluminescence compared with that of conventional architectures. When implemented in conjunction with a photovoltaic cell that translates autoluminescence into electricity, a new type of radiophotovoltaic micronuclear battery with a total power conversion efficiency of 0.889% and a power per activity of 139 microwatts per curie (μW Ci−1) is obtained.

 Subcellular protein localization regulates protein function and can be corrupted in cancers1 and neurodegenerative diseases2,3. The rewiring of localization to address disease-driving phenotypes would be an attractive targeted therapeutic approach. Molecules that harness the trafficking of a shuttle protein to control the subcellular localization of a target protein could enforce targeted protein relocalization and rewire the interactome. Here we identify a collection of shuttle proteins with potent ligands amenable to incorporation into targeted relocalization-activating molecules (TRAMs), and use these to relocalize endogenous proteins. Using a custom imaging analysis pipeline, we show that protein steady-state localization can be modulated through molecular coupling to shuttle proteins containing sufficiently strong localization sequences and expressed in the necessary abundance. We analyse the TRAM-induced relocalization of different proteins and then use nuclear hormone receptors as shuttles to redistribute disease-driving mutant proteins such as SMARCB1Q318X, TDP43ΔNLS and FUSR495X. TRAM-mediated relocalization of FUSR495X to the nucleus from the cytoplasm correlated with a reduction in the number of stress granules in a model of cellular stress. With methionyl aminopeptidase 2 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 as endogenous cytoplasmic and nuclear shuttles, respectively, we demonstrate relocalization of endogenous PRMT9, SOS1 and FKBP12. Small-molecule-mediated redistribution of nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 from nuclei to axons in primary neurons was able to slow axonal degeneration and pharmacologically mimic the genetic WldS gain-of-function phenotype in mice resistant to certain types of neurodegeneration4. The concept of targeted protein relocalization could therefore inspire approaches for treating disease through interactome rewiring. Targeted protein relocalization using shuttle proteins with potent ligands amenable to incorporation into targeted relocalization activating molecules could be used to regulate cellular physiology and correct disease states in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and genetic disorders."

 The coupling of conduction electrons and magnetic textures leads to quantum transport phenomena described by the language of emergent electromagnetic fields1–3. For magnetic skyrmions, spin-swirling particle-like objects, an emergent magnetic field is produced by their topological winding4–6, resulting in the conduction electrons exhibiting the topological Hall effect (THE)7. When the skyrmion lattice (SkL) acquires a drift velocity under conduction electron flow, an emergent electric field is also generated8,9. The resulting emergent electrodynamics dictate the magnitude of the THE by the relative motion of SkL and conduction electrons. Here we report the emergent electrodynamics induced by SkL motion in Gd2PdSi3, facilitated by its giant THE10,11. With increasing current excitation, we observe the dynamic transition of the SkL motion from the pinned to creep regime and finally to the flow regime, in which the THE is totally suppressed. We argue that the Galilean relativity required for the total cancellation of the THE may be generically recovered in the flow regime, even in complex multiband systems such as the present compound. Moreover, the observed THE voltages are large enough to enable real-time measurement of the SkL velocity–current profile, which shows the inertial-like motion of the SkL in the creep regime, appearing as the current hysteresis of the skyrmion velocity. The emergent electrodynamics induced by skyrmion lattice motion in Gd2PdSi3 is facilitated by its giant topological Hall effect dynamic transition, and implies the emergent Galilean relativity of current-driven skyrmions."

 Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are marked by insulin resistance1,2. Cells within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), which are crucial for regulating metabolism, become insulin resistant during the progression of metabolic disease3–8, but these mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we investigated the role of a specialized chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan extracellular matrix, termed a perineuronal net, which surrounds ARC neurons. In metabolic disease, the perineuronal net of the ARC becomes augmented and remodelled, driving insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Disruption of the perineuronal net in obese mice, either enzymatically or with small molecules, improves insulin access to the brain, reversing neuronal insulin resistance and enhancing metabolic health. Our findings identify ARC extracellular matrix remodelling as a fundamental mechanism driving metabolic diseases. Experiments in mice show that the perineural net has a key role in metabolic disease by controlling insulin access to neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus."

 Space radiation is a notable hazard for long-duration human spaceflight1. Associated risks include cancer, cataracts, degenerative diseases2 and tissue reactions from large, acute exposures3. Space radiation originates from diverse sources, including galactic cosmic rays4, trapped-particle (Van Allen) belts5 and solar-particle events6. Previous radiation data are from the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle in low-Earth orbit protected by heavy shielding and Earth’s magnetic field7,8 and lightly shielded interplanetary robotic probes such as Mars Science Laboratory and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter9,10. Limited data from the Apollo missions11–13 and ground measurements with substantial caveats are also available14. Here we report radiation measurements from the heavily shielded Orion spacecraft on the uncrewed Artemis I lunar mission. At differing shielding locations inside the vehicle, a fourfold difference in dose rates was observed during proton-belt passes that are similar to large, reference solar-particle events. Interplanetary cosmic-ray dose equivalent rates in Orion were as much as 60% lower than previous observations9. Furthermore, a change in orientation of the spacecraft during the proton-belt transit resulted in a reduction of radiation dose rates of around 50%. These measurements validate the Orion for future crewed exploration and inform future human spaceflight mission design. Measurements from the heavily shielded Orion spacecraft during the uncrewed Artemis I mission show dose-rate reductions due to shielding and orientation for Van Allen belt crossings and quantify the interplanetary cosmic-ray radiation in a human-rated spacecraft."

This study provides new genome assemblies of the model species S. mediterranea and 3 relatives and uses comparative genomics of planarians to reveal that synteny is not an evolutionary constraint in flatworm genome evolution. 
 The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea is being studied as a model species for regeneration, but the assembly of planarian genomes remains challenging. Here, we report a high-quality haplotype-phased, chromosome-scale genome assembly of the sexual S2 strain of S. mediterranea and high-quality chromosome-scale assemblies of its three close relatives, S. polychroa, S. nova, and S. lugubris. Using hybrid gene annotations and optimized ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq protocols for regulatory element annotation, we provide valuable genome resources for the planarian research community and a first comparative perspective on planarian genome evolution. Our analyses reveal substantial divergence in protein-coding sequences and regulatory regions but considerable conservation within promoter and enhancer annotations. We also find frequent retrotransposon-associated chromosomal inversions and interchromosomal translocations within the genus Schmidtea and, remarkably, independent and nearly complete losses of ancestral metazoan synteny in Schmidtea and two other flatworm groups. Overall, our results suggest that platyhelminth genomes can evolve without syntenic constraints. Planarians are model systems for stem cells and regeneration.

Here the authors explore a general method based on the discrepancy in cohesive energy of the metals to synthesize a large library of bi-/multi-metallic single atom/atomic cluster materials for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 
 Atomically dispersed single atom (SA) and atomic cluster (AC) metallic materials attract tremendous attentions in various fields. Expanding monometallic SA and AC to multimetallic SA/AC composites opens vast scientific and technological potentials yet exponentially increasing the synthesis difficulty. Here, we present a general energy-selective-clustering methodology to build the largest reported library of carbon supported bi-/multi-metallic SA/AC materials. The discrepancy in cohesive energy results into selective metal clustering thereby driving the symbiosis of multimetallic SA or/and AC. The library includes 23 bimetallic SA/AC composites, and expanded compositional space of 17 trimetallic, quinary-metallic, septenary-metallic SA/AC composites. We chose bimetallic M1SAM2AC to demonstrate the electrocatalysis utility. Unique decoupled active sites and inter-site synergy lead to 8/47 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 for alkaline/acidic hydrogen evolution and over 1000 h durability in water electrolyzer. Moreover, delicate modulations towards composition and configuration yield high-performance catalysts for multiple electrocatalysis systems.

The slow-slip region can extend beyond the heterogeneity depending on loading conditions. 
 Seismic faults release the stress accumulated during tectonic movement through rapid ruptures or slow-slip events. The role of slow-slip events is crucial as they impact earthquakes occurrence. However, the mechanisms by which slow-slip affects the failure of frictionally locked regions remain elusive. Here, building on laboratory experiments, we establish that a slow-slip region acts as a nucleation center for seismic rupture, enhancing earthquakes’ frequency. We emulate slow-slip regions by introducing a granular material along part of a laboratory fault. Measuring the fault’s response to shear reveals that the heterogeneity serves as an initial rupture, reducing the fault shear resistance. Additionally, the slow-slip region extends beyond the heterogeneity with increasing normal load, demonstrating that fault composition is not the only requirement for slow-slip. Our results show that slow-slip modifies rupture nucleation dynamics, highlighting the importance of accounting for the evolution of the slow-slip region under varying conditions for seismic hazard mitigation. Lab experiments reveal that slow-slip events, generated by heterogeneity in fault composition, can trigger earthquakes by acting as an initial rupture.

 Cities are critical for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Their urban sustainable development (USD) plans and policies cover a wide range of issues, such as biodiversity protection, transportation or poverty reduction. Yet, such policy-making may lack democratic legitimacy if these policies are out of step with the demands and concerns of residents. Considering this, the present study compares residents’ preferences about USD policy issues with the priorities set out in existing USD policy plans. We scrutinized the preferences of 5,800 residents across eight European cities through the application of survey experiments and simultaneously examined 166 existing USD policy plans from these cities and compared them with the survey results. Our findings indicate an on average high acceptance of USD (72.61%) but with substantial democratic discrepancies: while USD policy plans predominantly prioritize issues, such as biodiversity, education and transportation, residents expressed preferences for issues linked to their essential and everyday needs, such as cost of living, public health and poverty. These democratic discrepancies between residents’ priorities and the content of USD policy plans highlight the necessity of securing basic human needs as integral aspects of USD to foster a more profound and democratically supported urban socio-ecological sustainability transformation.

 Climate change is affecting the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as droughts or floods, which result in loss and damage to people, crops and infrastructure. Global data on loss and damage used in research, policy and media primarily come from macrostatistics based on disaster inventories. Here, we propose a different approach, based on survey microdata. We harmonize data from 120,000 agricultural fields in six African countries for a period from 2008 to 2019 and quantify crop production losses related to climate shocks. We find substantial damages which affect around 35% of plots and reduce national crop production by 29% on average. The economic impacts are greater than the global disaster data suggest. The economic losses resulting from droughts and flood alone are US$5.1 billion higher than reported in disaster inventories, affecting between 145 and 170 million people. The difference stems mostly from smaller and less severe but frequent adverse events that go under-reported or undetected in disaster inventories and therefore elude macrostatistics and reporting. The findings have implications for measurement and policies related to loss and damage and disaster risk reduction.

 Interannual global mean surface temperature (GMST) forecast provides critical insights into the economic and societal implications of climate variability. The pronounced GMST elevation in 2023–2024 indicates that the Earth may have accumulated enough heat to cause widespread disasters, underscoring the necessity for establishing accurate short-term GMST predictions to offer timely and sustainable public service. However, capturing high-frequency annual variability (ANV) component of GMST poses challenges due to its susceptibility to intraseasonal-to-interannual (ISI) noises, particularly across the Northern Hemisphere’s mid-to-high latitudes. Averaging these ISI variations in November and December effectively enhances signal clarity, especially over oceans, and masks unpredictable noises on land. By forecasting the average GMST for November and December to extract ANV predictability, a strategy for annual GMST prediction was established. This approach successfully advanced precise GMST hindcasts by up to 2-months during 1980–2022, exceeding performance of existing climate models and boosting early warning for interannual GMST shifts."

 Soil moisture–atmosphere feedback (SAF) is expected to accelerate warming in the future, but its influences on the terrestrial water cycle over non-traditional hotspots of land–atmosphere coupling (e.g., East Asia) remains elusive due to strong heterogeneity and uncertainties at model grid scales. Here we show robust evidence of the integral effects of SAF on streamflow under future warming across major river basins in China. Based on high-resolution hydrological modelings driven by CMIP6 simulations with/without land–atmosphere coupling, SAF is projected to significantly increase spring streamflow by 28–58% in mid-latitude China, but decrease it by 12–48% in other regions. Such contrary effects are attributed to the soil moisture-precipitation interaction, which causes spatially opposite changes in precipitation through thermodynamic (e.g., ascending/descending vertical motions) and thermal (e.g., weakened meridional water vapor transport) atmospheric adjustments. Our result highlights the importance of SAF in altering freshwater resources even in locations not typically considered to be SAF hotspots.

 Nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from forest soils are typically intensified under elevated anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition, likely due to increased N availability. However, the extent to which these emissions are linked to N availability across different timescales remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the temporal-scale-dependent mechanisms of N₂O emissions in a subalpine forest under N-addition, using hourly-resolved N₂O measurements. Our findings revealed that N-addition induced both pulse emissions and a long-lasting effect on soil N₂O emissions. The pulse emissions occurred immediately after each N-addition, indicating a strong linkage between the pulse events and elevated N availability. However, variations in annual N₂O emissions were not directly regulated by N availability but were instead explained by denitrifying microbial functional genes ratio. A global meta-analysis further confirmed the importance of microbial functional genes in regulating N2O emissions in natural terrestrial ecosystems. Our results suggest a crucial role of microbial functional genes in predicting annual N2O emissions from forest soils. Addition of nitrogen to subalpine forest soil leads to scale-dependent pulses of nitrous oxide emissions and increases in seasonal and annual emissions that were modified by the abundance of microbial functional genes, according to manipulated field experiments."

 Improving our understanding of future ocean carbon uptake requires a nuanced understanding of the value of the annual ocean sink. Here, we combine an abatement cost-based approach and a climate damage-based approach to assess the value of the annual ocean sink. The former shows that the aggregate cost of national climate policies could increase by up to USD 80 billion if the ocean carbon sink weakens by 10 percent. As a complementary perspective, the damage-based approach shows that the annual ocean carbon sink contributes between USD 300 billion and USD 2,332 billion to countries’ inclusive wealth. Despite the conceptual appeal of the damage-based approach for its potential insights into regional wealth redistribution, uncertainties in national social cost of carbon estimates make it less reliable than the abatement cost-based approach, which in turn provides more reliable estimates for a fiscal cost assessment of improved monitoring services of the ocean carbon sink.

 Under predicted future ocean conditions, corals will experience frequent and intense thermal stress events while simultaneously being exposed to chronic ocean acidification. Yet, some corals will likely be more resistant and/or resilient to these predicted conditions than others and may be critical to reef persistence in the future. Following natural thermal stress in two consecutive years (2014 and 2015), we evaluated the effects of feeding and simulated ocean acidification on the physiological recovery of Montipora capitata and Porites compressa sourced from Kāneʻohe Bay and Waimānalo Bay, Hawaiʻi. Following the 2014 thermal stress event, simulated ocean acidification did not slow recovery of the holobiont and feeding enhanced recovery. However, feeding did not decrease susceptibility to the 2015 thermal stress event, and simulated ocean acidification did not increase susceptibility. Recovery strategies employed between species and between sites clearly differed, highlighting that coral reef restoration and management should consider species-level and site-specific vulnerabilities. Overall, our findings call attention to the immediate threat which ocean warming presents, the lack of additional stress to the holobiont from ocean acidification, the importance of heterotrophy in coral resilience, and the potential significance of additional local biotic stressors (i.e., predator outbreaks) for coral resiliency under annual thermal stress.

 Understanding spatial interactions in urban environments has become critical in the context of spatio-temporal big data. However, Spatial–temporal big data often exhibit non-uniformity, necessitating the imputation of spatial interaction relationships derived from the analysis of such data. Previous studies often used simplified grid-based or TAZ approaches that ignore the complex interactions for spatial interaction imputation, leading to limitations in accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a two-layer spatial interaction imputation framework (SIF) for accurate multi-scale spatial interaction imputation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that we impute spatial interactions in multi-scale urban areas. In the first layer, it utilised a hierarchical spatial units division algorithm inspired by Shannon’s information entropy to hierarchically classify study area using point of interest (POI) data; In the second layer, it integrates the classified areas and travel flow data into a spatial interaction graph convolutional network (SI-GCN) for spatial interaction imputation. Two case studies were conducted in Beijing, China and New York City, USA, using over eight million taxi data and one million bike-sharing data. The results showed the superior performance of SIF compared to baseline models.

 Automatic 3D reconstruction from spaceborne charge-coupled device (CCD) optical imagery is still a challenge as the rational functional model (RFM) based reconstruction pipeline failed to amount to the advances of pinhole based approaches in computer vision and photogrammetry. As a consequence, the accuracy and completeness of the reconstructed surface by RFM based pipeline improved slightly recent years. Though the perspective camera approximation model was explored to convert the RFM to pinhole model, it could hardly guarantee the reconstruction accuracy due to the re-projection error introduced when approximating the linear push broom camera to perspective camera. Hence, we present a refined equivalent pinhole model (REPM) for 3D reconstruction from spaceborne CCD imagery. We initially investigated the aspects that influence the re-projection error thru mathematical induction and discovered that the image size and height range of the captured area are the two key factors. To ensure the performance of the 3D reconstruction while minimizing the re-projection error, we explored the optimal image size to crop large-scale image with, while alleviated the height range effect on the image space by re-projecting the cropped images to be closed to the pseudo-image that is captured by the approximated perspective camera. The above-mentioned improvements are implemented in an image partition module and an image geometric correction module respectively, and are encompassed in the proposed REPM-based 3D reconstruction pipeline. We conducted extensive experiments on different images covering various areas from different linear-array CCD sensors to verify the proposed approach. The results indicate that our pipeline can achieve higher accuracy and completeness and exhibits great potential. The implementation of the pipeline is available at here."

 Arising from the Chemical Assessment of Surfaces and Air (CASA) 2022 study at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF), this paper presents the first evaluation of indoor surface emissions to a house measured with a surface flux chamber coupled to an online, non-targeted volatile organic compound (VOC) mass spectrometric detection. These surface emissions are compared to those assessed using ambient, whole house indoor VOC measurements and the outdoor air change rate. Chamber emission rates varied by almost four orders of magnitude across 35 quantified VOCs. The whole house emissions measured by campaign-long ambient measurements and the flux chamber emissions (when scaled to the painted surface area of the house) are similar, with an average ratio between the two of 1.3 ± 1.0. The general agreement between these two approaches indicates that the flux chamber was not solely measuring primary emissions from building materials located below the chamber. Rather, the results suggest that over the 12-year house lifetime, VOCs have been widely distributed around the house, migrating from their primary sources to secondary surface reservoirs. With the house in a quasi-steady state, the thermodynamic activities (i.e., the vapor pressures) of the VOCs within the different reservoirs become similar. Emissions of aromatics and monoterpenes have declined since the house was built, whereas aldehyde emissions have remained relatively constant."

 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions from the vehicle refueling process is an increasingly significant issue. However, the gasoline formulation showed seasonal variation, potentially leading to the alterations of VOC components during the refueling process. Refueling VOCs of different gasoline and diesel were collected at some typical gas stations during both summer and winter to analyze their seasonal emissions characteristics, environmental impacts, and associated health risks. The refueling VOC profiles in summer consisted of a notably higher proportion of small oxygenated VOCs (C3) and a significantly lower content of halocarbons compared to those in winter, which indicated that the refueling VOC profiles in just a single season failed to capture characteristics of the entire year. The OFP values of gasoline vapor in two test seasons were consistent (around 2.9 g O3/g VOCs), with the dominant species of acrolein (15.7 ± 2.5%) in summer and i-pentane (23.2 ± 2.1%) in winter. Aromatics contributed the most to secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP), with toluene (65.4%, summer; 48.5%, winter) being the overwhelmingly dominant species. The assessment of inhalation health risks indicated that exposure to adverse VOCs resulted in definite non-cancer risk (HQ = 5.9) and cancer risk (ICR = 4.6 × 10−4) to the gas station attendant, which exceeded the acceptable level, with 1,3-butadiene exhibiting the highest toxicity and a dual toxicity risk. The impact of VOCs on health was more severe during winter compared to summer. It is recommended that seasonal influences should be considered when controlling VOC pollution at gas stations."

 The short-, medium- and long-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs) were measured in outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and gas-phases in Xi'an in spring, autumn and winter of 2021, which containing two special events during this time, the sandstorms happened in spring and the COVID-19 epidemic in winter. The CPs concentrations in PM2.5 were seasonal variated, with spring (mean: 17.5 ng/m3) > autumn (mean: 8.6 ng/m3) > winter (mean: 5.8 ng/m3). The CPs concentrations in gas phases (mean:12.6 ng/m3) were lower than in PM2.5 in spring, and it showed shorter carbon chain and lower chlorinated CPs dominated in SCCPs in gas phase (C10, Cl5,6) compared with in PM2.5 (C11, Cl6,7). The absorption was the main mechanism for the partitioning of CP in particle and gaseous phase. The shorter carbon chain CPs (C10,11, C14) with lower chlorinated (Cl6,7) CPs dominated in SCCPs and MCCPs, while the longer carbon chain (C25 or C29) with Cl6,12 dominated in the LCCPs. So, more researches about the LCCPs should be concerned. Additionally, the CPs concentrations of all samples during the sandstorms in spring were increased 30.4%–136.5% and the proportion of SCCPs was obviously elevated. CPs concentrations obviously decreased during the COVID-19 epidemic in winter, while SCCPs, MCCPs attributed comparable in autumn and winter. Potential source analysis showed that during the sandstorms in spring, atmospheric pollutants were mainly transported over a long distance from northern and northeast of Shaanxi Province, while it was mainly from local emission during the COVID-19 epidemic in winter. The health risk assessment of CPs displayed that there had no or very low inhalation exposure risks of CPs for all age groups, but the younger age groups (younger than 6 years old) should be played more attention for their not fully development of their immune and respiratory systems."

 PM2.5 can cause lung cell injury. Due to the complexity and variation of the physical and chemical properties of PM2.5, the risk of lung cell injury may depend significantly on the type of atmospheric environment. With a population of 120 million, the Chengdu-Chongqing region in China is the most populated region in the world that experiences both high humidity and low solar radiation (HHLR). However, PM2.5-related lung cell injury and treatment strategies in this type of environment are still unclear. Thus, our study focuses on the relationships between the chemical components, lung cell injury effects, and pathogenic mechanisms of PM2.5 in HHLR (HHLR-PM2.5). In terms of mass, organic carbon (OC), NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+ are found to be the most significant components of HHLR-PM2.5. Extracts of HHLR-PM2.5 significantly inhibit cell viability, stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and trigger inflammation. Utilizing a combination of multi-omics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology, it is found that HHLR-PM2.5 extracts inhibit E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (UHRF1) to suppress DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and hamper DNA methylation, culminating in lung cell injury. Additionally, integrating transcriptomic data with human disease databases highlights chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a potential lung cell injury-related respiratory affliction induced by HHLR-PM2.5. This study expands the scientific comprehension of the health risks associated with HHLR-PM2.5, deciphers the molecular mechanism of lung cell injury, and provides precise treatment strategies for HHLR-PM2.5-induced lung cell injury."

In the morning peak hours, bicycle commuters were exposed to the highest PM concentration, those on buses to the highest BC concentration (3.4 ± 3.0 μg/m3), and those on buses and taxis to the highest UFP number concentration. Throughout the rides, the commuter on the subway had the lowest mean exposure concentration of PM, BC, and UFP number.

 The concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the atmospheres above major cities in Northeast China are relatively high. Dew is an effective way to settle and remove particulate and gaseous matter in the formation process. Notably, 16-PAH concentration dew analysis was conducted in four major cities (Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian) from April to November 2023. In the study area, 2–3-ring PAHs dominated in dew in both the dissolved and particle phases, followed by 4-ring and 5–6-ring PAHs. Phe was the most common individual PAH in dew. Because PAHs in wet deposition are closely related to those in the atmosphere, the concentration of PAHs in dew was much lower than that in snow. The proportions of the gaseous-phase scavenging ratio (Wg) to the total scavenging ratio (Wt) in Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian increased with increasing temperature, reaching 22.98%, 29.02%, 30.71% and 33.22%, respectively, which indicated that the ability of dew to remove PAHs in the particle phase was greater than that to remove PAHs in the gas phase. The concentration of dissolved-phase PAHs in dew was lower than that of particle-phase PAHs. The total PAH fluxes were 43.25, 33.35, 32.16, and 25.63 ng/m2·d in Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian, respectively, decreasing from north to south. The dew amount was much smaller than the rainfall and snow amount (by two orders of magnitude), and the PAH flux in dew was much lower than that in rain and snow. Isomeric ratio assessment coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the source of PAHs in dew was a combination of vehicle emissions and biomass and coal combustion.

 Advanced machine learning models have recently achieved high predictive accuracy for weather and climate prediction. However, these complex models often lack inherent transparency and interpretability, acting as “black boxes” that impede user trust and hinder further model improvements. As such, interpretable machine learning techniques have become crucial in enhancing the credibility and utility of weather and climate modeling. In this paper, we review current interpretable machine learning approaches applied to meteorological predictions. We categorize methods into two major paradigms: (1) Post-hoc interpretability techniques that explain pre-trained models, such as perturbation-based, game theory based, and gradient-based attribution methods. (2) Designing inherently interpretable models from scratch using architectures like tree ensembles and explainable neural networks. We summarize how each technique provides insights into the predictions, uncovering novel meteorological relationships captured by machine learning. Lastly, we discuss research challenges and provide future perspectives around achieving deeper mechanistic interpretations aligned with physical principles, developing standardized evaluation benchmarks, integrating interpretability into iterative model development workflows, and providing explainability for large foundation models."

 This study investigated the inter-annual variations, transport pathways, pollution sources, and health implications of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Zhengzhou, China, a city notably affected by ground-level ozone (O3) pollution. Analyzing VOCs data from the summers of 2017–2021 revealed an average summer VOCs concentration of 61.8 ± 18.2 μg/m3, predominantly consisting of alkanes (55.0%), aromatics (22.5%), and alkenes (16.9%). The study identified significant year-to-year disparities in VOC abundances and compositions, which were closely linked to meteorological conditions, including temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity. Additionally, factors like air mass origin, direction and transport distance critically influenced the VOCs characteristics, with local air masses exhibiting higher VOC concentrations than those from distances of 100–500 km to the northwest, west and east. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis identified major sources of VOCs as vehicle exhaust, oil and gas evaporation, solvent use, and biogenic emissions, with their contributions varying annually influenced by regional transport, environmental policies, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Health risk assessments, following U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, indicated negligible non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks from VOCs exposure, except for a potential carcinogenic risk from ethylbenzene. Solvent use sources were found to have the highest risks, with non-carcinogenic risks at 4.1 × 10−3 (negligible) and carcinogenic risks at 7.8 × 10−7 (with potentially carcinogenic in 2017 but negligible in subsequent years). This research underscored the complex dynamics of VOCs pollution and provided insights for developing effective pollution control strategies and enhancing public health in urban settings."

 Microplastics (MPs) are widely present in atmosphere without understanding about their influences on human health. Spatial variations of MPs in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), along with source contribution and health effects analyses, were investigated at two distinct background air quality locations in Hong Kong: TMS, a coastal site, and HT, a high-altitude site, both remote from anthropogenic activities. The higher concentration of total MPs concentration (∑MPs) was observed at HT (31.67 ± 10.25 pg/m3) compared to TMS (11.00 ± 4.69 pg/m3). Polyethylene (PE) was the dominant MP in both locations, and other MPs showed inconsistent concentration patterns in the analysis. Source identification analysis indicated that the MPs at HT was predominantly affected by marine sources, whereas the MPs at TMS was potentially due to continental/local sources. The HT was not an ideal location for monitoring atmospheric background concentration of MP due to high contributions from marine source. Cellular exposure to MPs experiments (A549 cells) demonstrated stronger correlations (p < 0.05) between exposure to MPs and oxidative stress (determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA)) than inflammation factors. The polyvinyl chloride, nylon 6,6 and polystyrene were the chemical compounds that can induce oxidative stress, and interactions among MPs.

 Air pollution episodes are critical environmental challenges in urban areas, primarily linked to the lack of ventilation during calm and stable atmospheric conditions, rather than a significant increase in emissions. The prevailing circulation pattern under these conditions is the Urban Heat Island Circulation (UHIC), which governs the characteristics of the urban pollution dome and the distribution of pollutants. This study aims to assess the UHIC's influence on spatial and temporal variations in pollutant concentrations and to investigate the efficiency of an Urban Chimney (UC) in improving air quality. Due to the interaction of micro- and meso-scale flows, a multi-scale analysis is required. For this purpose, a pressure-based CFD solver is adapted for analyzing airflow and pollutant dispersion in a multi-scale environment. A coordinate transformation method is used to account for meso-scale effects, and the resulting source terms are applied to the solver. The species transport equation is transformed to the new coordinate system, and the effects of species diffusion on enthalpy transport are included in the governing equations. The results demonstrate that UHIC reduces the average pollutant concentration and causes pollution peaks near ground level and at the city center. The interaction of micro-scale flow within the chimney with meso-scale UHIC impacts the flow field and pollutant concentration across the entire domain, decreasing the urban plume's vertical velocity by 40 percent and the mixing height at the city center by 20 percent. It also increases the vertical velocity within the UC by 23 percent. The UC can serve as a controlling tool for urban ventilation, and its capacity to remove pollutants increases sixfold when interacting with UHIC, reducing pollutant concentration citywide."

 A two-year (March 2021 to February 2023) continuous in-situ atmospheric CH4 measurements and periodic vertical CH4 measurements (<2000 m) in July and November 2021 were conducted at the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains in Xi'an, China, aiming to study the temporal and vertical variations in atmospheric CH4 and the influence of air mass transport. The two-year average CH4 concentration at this site was 2119.6 ± 108.8 ppb. Seasonal CH4 concentrations were the highest in winter (2177.6 ± 121.5 ppb) and lower in summer (2079.1 ± 77.6 ppb) and spring (2073.9 ± 68.4 ppb). Diurnal CH4 peaked at 10:00–11:00. Atmospheric CH4 there was mainly from local source emissions from Xi'an and short distance transport from the southern Qinling Mountains through the valleys. On the July sampling days, vertical CH4 concentrations increased in the morning (08:00) and at mid-night (23:30), while they decreased in the early afternoon (13:00) and late afternoon (18:00) from near the surface (20 m) to 200 m, increased at 200–500 m, and then decreased at 500–1000 m. During the heating period in November, vertical CH4 concentrations increased by 20.0–86.8 ppb at 20–200 m due to horizontal transport and poor atmospheric dispersion conditions, and then decreased up to 2000 m, with the fastest decrease rate (−44.4 ± 51.4 ∼ −17.6 ± 19.3 ppb/100 m) at 500–1000 m. Vertical CH4 concentrations increased at all heights especially below 500 m in serve haze, mainly attributed to horizontal transport from the northwestern and southeastern polluted regions.

 As a nitrogen source for biological growth, amino compounds can participate in global nitrogen cycle processes and directly impact ecosystems. Dry deposition samples were collected from September 2020 to August 2021 from the Danjiangkou Reservoir of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project. The dry deposition characteristics of amino acids in the reservoir area were analyzed, their sources were resolved, and the potential ecological impacts were evaluated.

 In order to clarify the concentration levels and sources of the water-insoluble amino acids (WIAA) in aerosols that have been received little attention in previous studies and to discuss their potential impact on nitrogen deposition, the WIAA in the coarse-mode (d = 2.0–10 μm) and fine-mode (d < 2.0 μm) aerosols were measured at a forested site in Japan together with the water-soluble free and combined amino acids. The sum of the WIAA showed more than a 6-times higher concentration than that of the water-soluble amino acids in the coarse-mode range and a similar concentration to that in the fine-mode range, which suggests a significant contribution of the WIAA to the amino acids pool in aerosols. The WIAA were predominantly partitioned into the coarse-mode range. The concentration of the coarse-mode WIAA was the highest in the summer and a strong correlation was found between the coarse-mode WIAA and nss-K+ concentrations. These results suggest that plant debris and the associated materials are important sources for the coarse-mode WIAA and the increase in the suspension of these particulate materials caused the enhancement of the WIAA in the summer. Remarkably higher concentrations of the coarse-mode WIAA than the water-soluble amino acids would be caused by these particulate materials. In the fine-mode range, on the other hand, the concentration of the WIAA was the highest in the spring and strongly correlated with the fine-mode nss-K+ concentrations. The fine-mode WIAA would be mainly derived from the biomass burning particles. The coarse-mode WIAA were estimated to significantly contribute to the dry deposition flux of the total nitrogen. The present study implies a potential impact of the WIAA in the coarse aerosols on nitrogen deposition."

 The atmospheric aqueous-phase chemistry has received increasing attention in the last decades for its non-negligible environmental significance. Yet, the insufficient experimental data on oxidative reaction rate constants (kaq) obstructs the further analysis and modeling of this system. Predictive models based on machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown potential as an effective estimation tool, however, they are restricted to the lack of training data as well. To overcome this data limitation, we developed multi-task (MT) models that could exploit the common knowledge from reactions in gas- and aqueous-phases simultaneously. Toward kaq of organic compounds with hydroxyl radical (OH), nitrate radical (NO3), and ozone (O3), the MT models showed a notably better predictive ability compared to benchmark models, while obtaining wide applicability on compounds from different chemical classes. By interpreting the models using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), we evidenced that the MT models utilized the common knowledge in both phases and correctly identified the reaction mechanisms. This study aims to provide new insight into the estimation of necessary kinetic parameters in atmospheric aqueous-phase chemistry, as well as a reference to ML research for other predictive tasks of atmospheric interest."

 Snowfall is a critical component of the Earth system and an important indicator and amplifier of climate change. Climate warming is reducing the seasonal snowpack globally, which could have catastrophic consequences for the regions in high dependence on snow for water recharge. However, the climate influences on extreme snowfall events, which significantly impact humans, are still poorly understood. This study uses the Tibetan Plateau snowpack observation dataset combined with NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6) climate data to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of snowfall, and to explore its response mechanism to climate change and future change trends across the Lower Yarlung Zangbo River (LYZR) in Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP). Annual snowfall decreased at a rate of 1.05 mm per decade (P < 0.05) during the historical period (1960–2014). Relative to 1960–2014, annual snowfall would decline of ∼38 % and ∼ 73 % by the end of the 21st century under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. At the same time, a general decrease in extreme snowfall averaged the LYZR is expected for historical and future periods, but it showed notable spatial variations. The regional increase in extreme snowfall is mainly distributed along the valley of Brahmaputra-Yarlung Zangbo. In addition, precipitation accounted for 66.5 % of the snowfall variations during the historical period. Meanwhile, according to future warming, temperature would dominate snowfall variations, contributing 56.66 % to 72.92 % during 2015–2100. The projected response of mean and extreme snowfall to climate change indicates that it is a double-edged sword. To scientifically address the risks and challenges posed by snowfall changes in alpine regions, it is imperative to limit future climate warming."

 Utilizing the reanalysis data and model simulations, we explore the interannual variations of extreme high temperatures over the Indochina Peninsula during 1960–2022, as well as their responses to critical oceanic systems and corresponding mechanisms. Given the intricate interactions among oceanic regions, this study employs the Generalized Equilibrium Feedback Analysis method to extract the atmospheric responses to key ocean systems, including the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and tropical Atlantic. Results highlight the significant contributions of TIO and ENSO. It is suggested that the anomalous anticyclonic circulation located over the Indochina Peninsula, as a response to the warm TIO and ENSO, favors the local anomalous downward motions, resulting in reduced cloud cover, diminished precipitation, increased net radiative energy to the surface and increased sensible and latent heat flux from the surface to the atmosphere, and finally inducing an increase in extreme high temperatures. These observed patterns are also well simulated by the Community Earth System Model tropical Indian Ocean and tropical Pacific Ocean pacemaker experiments, indicating that the warmer tropical Indian Ocean and ENSO could induce anomalous anticyclonic (cyclonic) patterns at the lower (upper) troposphere over the South China Sea, thereby promoting the subsidence and occurrence of extreme high temperatures over the Indochina Peninsula."

 In this study, spatial and temporal variations of spring compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) over northern Asia (NA) during 1950–2020 and the related possible mechanisms are investigated on the interannual timescale. The standardized compound event indicator (SCEI) is used to represent compound dry and hot conditions over NA, which is validated by the observed summer case of CDHEs over western Russia in 2010. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF1) mode of the SCEI over NA presents a monopole pattern, while the EOF2 mode shows an east-west dipole pattern. Possible mechanism analysis indicates that the CDHEs tend to be modulated by local high-pressure anomalies, accompanied by reduced cloud cover and more solar radiation. The high-pressure anomalies can lead to warm temperature and water vapor divergence, which synergistically contributes to the occurrence of CDHEs. Further analysis shows that the EOF1 mode is jointly affected by the Scandinavian (SCAND) pattern and the Arctic Oscillation (AO); while the EOF2 mode is influenced by the Atlantic-Eurasian (AEA) teleconnection. Moreover, the North Atlantic tripolar pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) can influence the EOF1 mode through changing the AO. And the diagonal tripolar SST pattern over the North Atlantic affects the EOF2 mode via altering the AEA pattern. The influence of the SST patterns is further confirmed by numerical experiments using the Community Atmospheric Model version CAM-5.3."

 Significant vegetation increase in the Loess Plateau (LP) of China could strongly affect the surface water budget. Through the WRF model with the Water Vapor Tracer (WVT) method tracking moisture within the LP, this study conducted three sets of experiments from 1999 to 2018 with GLASS Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) data. The results indicate that vegetation has a critical role in partitioning evapotranspiration (ET) into transpiration (Et), canopy evaporation (Ecan), and soil evaporation (Edir), thus regulating terrestrial internal convective precipitation (P). The local P response largely depends on external P (E_P), while the internal P (I_P) contribution remains minor. In summer, the total wet difference of I_P in the LP is about 0.03 mm/day, almost 5 times that of E_P. Greening also causes surface runoff reduction. Thus, in spring and summer, surface water storage (W) decreases due to the greater increase in ET than in P. In autumn, W increases by about 0.06 mm/day due to a large decrease in Ecan, implying confining the increased W to shallower soils, resulting in accelerated loss of deep soil moisture. The greening trend of 2000–2018 contributed to an increase in I_P, which could not offset increased ET and reduced E_P, leading to terrestrial water storage reduction."

 The climatic disparities between urban cores and surrounding rural areas have become increasingly pronounced due to rapid urbanization. The vapor pressure deficit (VPD) serves as a critical meteorological indicator reflecting atmospheric aridity, and identifying the contributions of urban and rural climate factors on the urban-rural VPD disparities plays an important role in understanding urban climate and ecosystem development patterns. This study introduces a quantitative method, utilizing partial differential equations, to assess the relative contributions of two crucial meteorological factors—air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH)—toward urban-rural differences in VPD. Analyzing daily scale data from 116 pairs of urban and rural stations across mainland China for the period 2000–2017, we derived several key findings: Urban areas generally exhibit higher VPD than surrounding rural areas, with a relative difference in annual VPD of about 21.6 %, and the disparity increases over time. Furthermore, the influence of urbanization on VPD responds differently across seasons and geographical conditions. The simulated trends in VPD urban-rural differences using the partial differential method align closely with the actual observed trends, validating the effectiveness of our quantitative analysis approach. The VPD urban-rural disparity shows greater sensitivity to shifts in RH, with sensitivity coefficients exceeding 1.5 times to changes in T in most cases. RH is the primary factor causing VPD urban-rural differences in mainland China, and the relative contribution of RH is about 2.5 times of T. The patterns of sensitivity and the contribution of factors exhibit notable variation among subregions. This study enhances the understanding of how urbanization affects regional climate and provides insights for assessing the environmental impacts of future urban expansion."

 This study explores the uncertainty of future summer warming over Iberia using storylines constructed from climate model simulations of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Unlike prior storyline approaches focusing on remote drivers and global teleconnections of atmospheric circulation, we use regional factors that directly influence summer temperatures: ridging activity, soil moisture and Mediterranean sea surface temperature. These drivers explain a substantial portion of the observed variability across climate models, with ridging activity and soil moisture showing the strongest influence on Iberian warming. Under a high radiative forcing scenario (SSP5–8.5), the storylines of Iberian warming based on these two drivers range between 7 and 9 °C for the end of the 21st century. The storyline leading to the largest warming is characterised by a drying out of the soil conditions and an increase in the anticyclonic activity over Iberia. We find similar conclusions for simple extreme heat indicators, though the approach struggles with more complex heatwave metrics. We also propose a novel modification of the storyline approach to increase the data sample of climate responses by using different time intervals throughout the 21st century. This modification would allow the application of more complex statistical models, the exploration of non-linear relationships and the identification of other drivers shaping the regional climate projections."

The observation-validated simulation data were used to examine how asymmetric rotational and environmental flows played the roles in determining the contraction of the radius of maximum kinetic energy of symmetric rotational flow (Kψs). The radius of maximum Kψs was contracted rapidly before rapid intensification (RI) and moved inward slowly, then barely moved, and moved inward slowly again during RI.The conversion from kinetic energy of asymmetric rotational flow (Kψa) to Kψs was induced by advection of asymmetric rotational tangential wind by asymmetric divergent radial wind. The conversion and convergence of inward flux of Kψs led to the rapid contraction before RI. During RI, in additional to horizontal and vertical flux convergence of Kψs, the conversion from environmental kinetic energy (Ke) to Kψs through the interaction between Kψs and symmetric radial environmental flow was important for the second slow contraction."

 To improve forecast skill of extreme weather events, it is of primary importance to construct accurate initial conditions for a convective-scale ensemble prediction system (EPS). The traditional initial perturbation schemes, e.g., dynamic downscaling, fail to capture the amplitude or structure of convective-scale forecast errors accurately, especially near steep terrain or meso- and small-scale systems during weather system's rapid change. In this study, we developed a new initial perturbation optimizing technique, namely the cosine analysis constraint method. This method is then used to improve the downscaled initial perturbations by introducing smaller-scale information from the analysis increments, generated from data assimilation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the cosine analysis constraint method in the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) convective-scale EPS. Using the control experiment (CTRL) without any modification to the initial perturbation scheme as a reference, we designed the cosine analysis constraint experiment (CONS) and compared it with CTRL. We selected a case study of convective precipitation and two groups of one-month experiments were initialized to verify the feasibility of the new method and exclude case dependence. The results of the one-month test show that adopting the cosine analysis constraint method to optimize the initial perturbations can effectively enhance the consistency between the ensemble mean and the corresponding reanalysis field (regarded as observations). In the case study, the larger horizontal distribution of precipitation spread in CONS indicated the location of convective precipitation more effectively, which is important for operational weather forecasting. The significant effect of the moisture process was confirmed, especially in CONS.

 Variations in rainfall patterns in the Northeast region of Brazil (NEB) are high and multiscalar, increasing susceptibility to extreme drought and/or flood events. The objective of this study was to characterize rainfall patterns and monthly dry-wet periods using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) from 1990 to 2019 in the South Coast of NEB, utilizing geostatistical interpolation methods. The study was based on a climatological dataset from the coastal region of the state of Bahia, collected from 112 weather stations. A map projecting aquifer in the study area was established, and SPI was determined. The data were subjected to descriptive, multivariate, and geostatistical statistics. Hydrogeological and hydrochemical maps were prepared. The months of October to April are characterized as rainy months (>300 mm). The coefficient of variation showed low standards due to atmospheric circulation systems. The Gaussian and exponential models presented the best fits (R2 > 0.86) for rainfall and SPI data. The quality of groundwater in the study area ranges from excellent to good, except for the north center part of the study area, where the groundwater quality is poor.

 Tropical cyclones can have different precursors, but most of them affecting Europe have a tropical transition origin and develop in autumn. This research focuses on analyzing changes on favorable environments for tropical transition development in the North Atlantic (NATL) basin for this season under the Anthropogenic Climate Change (ACC) effect. Comparisons between the climatology of some relevant variables related to tropical cyclogenesis have been computed for different periods, considering the ACC effect. For this purpose, the SSP5–8.5 scenario from an adapted version of the EC-Earth3 climatic model has been used. The combination of the obtained results is indicative of a NATL environment tropicalization in response to ACC, weightier for the end of the XXI century. Therefore, the NATL environment will be more prone to tropical transition development in the future, which is of particular concern since tropical cyclones are notorious for their lethality and economic impact worldwide.Key points1.To enhance the knowledge of how the ACC could influence the NATL environment behavior to favor tropical transition development.2.To deepen on the understanding of how the ACC could have impacts on the NATL environment to promote tropical cyclones intensification."

 Lightning is a self-developing charge transport system that exhibits fundamental manifestations of the macro-scale polarity asymmetry. This asymmetry is tightly connected with peculiarities of the reversal point (the point of zero leader sheath charge or, alternatively, a site where the lightning channel potential coincides with the intracloud one) movement along the leader growth direction. The study presents a stochastic lightning discharge model that is used to analyze the reversal point dynamics. It is shown that the reversal point shifts towards the direction of growth of the dominant leader, i.e. the leader with prevailing peripheral current. The cases of upward and downward directions of the positive leader propagation are considered to study how the difference in altitudes of positive and negative lightning poles influences the mode of reversal point drift. The model predicts that, for the case of an intracloud lightning, the amplitudes of oscillation of reversal point altitude and voltage are of the order of 1 km and 100 MV, respectively, with the reversal point voltage change rate being of the order of 10 MV/ms. The results allow to conclude that the reversal point meandering is a fundamental manifestation of lightning evolution."

 Exploring the links between moist processes, convection, and intensification in modeled tropical cyclones (TCs) remains an important object in the TC internal dynamics. In this study, the full life cycle of an idealized TC is diagnosed by a local moist available energy budget. In general, the diabatic term in available potential energy (APE) mainly from the microphysical processes dominates the rapid intensification (RI) of the TC, while the uplift term makes a negative and considerable contribution, implying the importance of water lifting in TC development. The budgets at different layers in the inner region are further explored. In the lower troposphere, the downward transport of the vertical pressure flux dominates the growth of the available elastic energy (AEE); the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the microphysical processes contribute more to APE in the pre-RI and RI stage, respectively. In the mid-upper troposphere, the diabatic term mainly from the microphysical processes leads to the growth of APE; then the increased APE is converted into mechanical energy and ultimately the cyclone intensifies. The vertical pressure fluxes transport downward below 10 km and upward above 10 km, with the AEE being deposited in the lower troposphere and removed in the mid-upper troposphere. Compared to previous budget analyses, our approach emphasizes the conditional instability of the atmosphere and the corresponding result aligns more closely with the conditional instability of the second kind (CISK) mechanism. Also, the divergence of the APE flux at high levels indicates an instantaneous strengthening of the wind speed model."

 Two downward negative flashes (F1612 & F1613) with multiple return strokes struck to the 356-m Shenzhen Tower were analyzed. The high-speed camera captured upward positive connecting leaders (UCL) for the first strokes of both flashes and two subsequent strokes of F1612. The observations also show that none of the downward negative leader (DNL) completely propagated to the tower tip before the occurrence of the return stroke (RS), so that we inferred that the UCL initiated from the tower tip might exist for each RS of the two flashes. The possible height of the UCL and DNL connecting point above the tower tip for each RS was estimated, which showed a positive correlation to the speed of corresponding DNL. The striking distances estimated for 8 subsequent RSs in F1612 were in a range from 14.6 m to 85.4 m and that for 3 subsequent RSs in F1613 were from 24.2 m to 66.2 m.

 The selection of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterisation schemes is crucial for the simulation of local meteorology, especially under extreme weather events. A suitable PBL scheme is one of the key conditions to accurately reproduce the real weather conditions. In this study, the performance of all the three available PBL schemes that can be coupled with the multi-layer urban canopy model in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model: Yonsei University (YSU), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), and Bougeault-Lacarrere (BL), is evaluated for a cold spell event with Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) as the study region. It is found that accurate prediction of the strength of the vertical mixing and the change in wind speeds over the upper atmosphere is critical for reproducing the nighttime temperatures during the cold spell. The simulations of the BL scheme are consistent with observations that wind speeds do not vary much during daytime and nighttime, thus exhibiting strong vertical mixing and slowing down the near-surface temperature decrease during nighttime. The MYJ and YSU schemes cause significant underestimation of the nighttime 2-m temperature due to significant overestimation of the nighttime upper-air wind speeds, which leads to more heat transport through horizontal advection and hinders vertical mixing and convective activities. The results confirm that selection of a suitable PBL scheme can effectively reduce the uncertainty of the simulation results, and the coupling of the BL scheme with the multi-layer urban canopy model can better simulate the cold spell events occurring in the GBA, which also provides valuable references for the simulation of other similar coastal cities."

 Understanding the impact of various weather systems on surface wind speed (SWS) holds immense importance in enhancing the efficiency of wind power generation. Among the many systems that affect regional weather patterns, atmospheric blocking stands out as a key influencer. Here, we explored the influence of winter blocking in Eurasia on SWS changes over China. We found that the majority of blockings over Eurasia occurred around the Okhotsk Sea and Europe and that the blockings that occurred at different locations significantly influenced regional SWS changes. The blockings that occurred in western Russia and eastern Okhotsk consistently influenced most of China, increasing the SWS by 0.2–0.5 m/s and decreasing it by −0.4 to −0.2 m/s, respectively. The blocking that occurred over Russia also generally increased the SWS, and the areas with elevated SWS were mainly concentrated on the Tibetan Plateau and southeastern China. The influence of other blockings on SWS showed significant regional differences. Blockings influence SWS mainly through the weather conditions they control, whereas the intensity and duration of blockings have negligible effects on SWS variations."

 The western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) is a critical atmospheric circulation system influencing weather and climate patterns in eastern China. Accurately predicting its activity is essential for anticipating and managing natural disasters such as droughts and floods in the region. In this study, we employ the decision tree (DT) as the fundamental model and devise a compatible framework to create an integrated model known as the Decision Tree Integration Model for Synthesizing Multiple External Forcing Signals (DTI-MS), to perform classification prediction of the WNPSH ridge line in summer. Within the construction of DTI-MS, the interpretability advantage of DT model is fully exploited. Three significant sources of external forcing signals, namely sea surface temperature in the Pacific, Tropical Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, and snow depth across the Eurasian continent, are identified from distinct DT models, with clear physical meanings. Through the voting strategy, these signals are integrated, laying the groundwork for DTI-MS to synthesize multiple external forcing signals. Regarding prediction performance, DTI-MS achieves a high classification accuracy of 91% in the training set and 93% in the testing set, with recalls for the southerly and northerly positions of the WNPSH in the testing set also exceeding 80%. Compared with the commonly used machine learning models such as DT and Random Forests constructed through general modeling approaches, DTI-MS also demonstrates higher classification accuracy. Overall, DTI-MS not only shows promising potential in predicting the WNPSH ridge line, but its integration framework also provides a new paradigm for short-term climate prediction modeling."

 Accurate representation of the land use/land cover (LULC) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been shown to be crucial for improved simulation of surface variables and urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. In this study, a ground truthed LULC dataset over Metro Manila (MM) was integrated in the WRF model to assess and quantify the relative contributions of using an updated land use/land cover (ULULC), activating the single-layer urban canopy model (WSLUCM) and anthropogenic heat (WAH), and consideration of urban surface heterogeneity (LIR) representation on simulated Surface Temperature (ST) relative to the default model settings (CTRL) of the WRF model. Additionally, the study examines the daytime and nighttime UHI features over MM, using a reference simulation where urban grids were replaced with cropland (CRP). Numerical simulations were carried out for April 2018, a typical dry month without monsoonal influence over MM to get a clear UHI characterization. Data from nine weather stations distributed across MM was used for performance evaluation. Results show negligible daytime biases in ST for CTRL, ULULC, and WAH, and underestimated ST for WSLUCM. At night, CTRL and ULULC (WSLUCM and WAH) tend to overestimate (underestimate) ST. Of the four factors analyzed, updating LULC, using SLUCM, including AH, and accounting for urban surface heterogeneity can change daytime ST by 0.3 °C, -0.6 °C, 0.3 °C, and 0 °C, respectively, and nighttime ST by 0.5 °C, -1.2 °C, 0.3 °C, and 0.4 °C, respectively. Widespread daytime warming and a distinct nocturnal UHI following urbanization were confirmed for MM when the LULC accounted for urban heterogeneity. While data limitations for MM limit the specification of the SLUCM, its UHI features are best represented in WRF when an updated land cover dataset is used."

 The coincidence of extreme cold, precipitation, and freezing weather is one of the most significant natural disasters in winter, with extensive impacts on public transportation, the energy industry, and the ecological landscape. Despite the importance of such events, comprehensive analyses of the performance of cutting-edge numerical weather prediction models at convection-permitting scales remain inadequate. This paper investigates the prolonged freezing event that occurred from January 24 to 28, 2018 in South China using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with a horizontal grid spacing of 3 km. The focus is on evaluating the performance of the WRF model and the impact of microphysical parameterizations and nudging techniques. The results show that the WRF model successfully captures the main features of the prolonged freezing event, including the low-level collision of cold and warm air in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley and the spatial distribution of precipitation. However, the model overestimates the strength of warm air from the south, leading to a northward shift of the precipitation belt. The choice of physical parameterizations significantly influences model performance, with microphysical schemes of P3, Thompson, and MYDM showing better model skill in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). The analysis also highlights the importance of nudging techniques, particularly grid nudging, which significantly improves model performance. Furthermore, the inclusion of local, very dense station observations from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) during the nudging process provides additional improvement. A further investigation reveals that the accuracy in reproducing low-level convergence over South China is the main factor influencing model performance across different sensitivity simulations. This study underscores the value of convection-permitting simulations in accurately reproducing extreme freezing events over China."

 Exploring the physical characteristics of lightning discharge channels based on spectrum can help to reveal the microscopic mechanism of the discharge process and provide a theoretical basis for lightning protection research. According to the spectra of six cloud-to-ground lightning return stroke processes and plasma conduction theory, we investigated the evolution of the total intensity of ionic and atomic lines in the spectra, conductivity, and other parameters along the discharge channel at different stages of the return stroke. The results show that the intensity of ionic lines in the spectrum present an obvious decaying trend with increasing height along the channel during the initial current-rise phase of the return stroke. In the later stages, the decay of ionic line intensity along the channel height slowed down. The intensity of the atomic lines varied slightly with increasing height along the channel during the entire return stroke process. The different space-time evolution characteristics of the spectral line intensity with different excitation energies reflect the differences in the mechanism of light radiation in the core current-carrying and surrounding thermal channels. The spectral characteristics further confirm that the ionic line with higher excitation energy directly relates to the physical process in the core current-carrying channel, and its intensity can roughly reflect the change in current along the channel. The attenuation of the return stroke current along the channel was mainly manifested in the initial stage of the return stroke. The decay rate of conductivity along the channel height is slower than that of the ionic line intensity throughout the return stroke stage, which is related to the channel diameter, it is another key parameter affecting the current transmission in the discharge channel."

 Cloud bursts have become a pressing concern with their devastating impact and increasing frequency over the Himalayan region. Therefore, understanding the physical mechanisms associated with their occurrence is essential and urgent. Our investigation into the physical mechanisms of a cloud burst over Sauni Binsar, Uttarakhand, India, which occurred on 10 June 2021 around 06 UTC, is a step towards addressing this urgency. On the day of the cloud burst, there was a continuous accumulation/stagnation (at 850 hPa) of moist air over Sauni Binsar due to the northward propagation of the southwest monsoon, leading to atmospheric column supersaturation. The advection of warm air (dry) from the monsoon heat low at higher (700 hPa) caused potential instability over this region. Orographic lifting and a gradual increase in convergence over this region caused moist convection. Further, the analysis of Richardson's number indicated that turbulence was maximum in the middle and upper troposphere. Just a few hours before the cloud burst event (02–06 UTC 10 June 2021), the decrease in potential vorticity indicates the squashing of the moist columns and the decrease in the vorticity.

 We simulated three different thunderstorm events over India using a regional model with two different multi-moments cloud microphysical schemes: (i) Morrison double moment (Morrison-2 M) and (ii) National Taiwan University (NTU) triple moment (NTU-3 M). The results show that the choice of microphysical scheme significantly impacts storm structures, cloud formations, lightning intensity, and rainfall patterns. The lightning flash counts from the in-situ lightning detection network (LDN) are also used to compare the simulated storms. The Lightning Potential Index (LPI) was computed for both Morrison-2 M and NTU-3 M microphysics schemes and compared it with the LDN observation. Differences in simulations are attributed to the simulation of ice crystals, snow, and graupel by the microphysical schemes. The effects on the size distributions of cloud hydrometeors between the two microphysical schemes are also found to be important. The inclusions of ice crystal shapes likely accounted for the key differences between the two microphysics schemes. The results demonstrate that the simulation of lightning event characteristics is sensitive to the choice of microphysical parameterization schemes in numerical weather prediction models. In comparison to both the microphysical schemes, some aspects are better in the 2 M microphysics scheme, and some are better in the 3 M microphysics scheme. Morrison-2 M simulates more mixing ratio for the majority of cloud hydrometeors across all cases than the NTU-3 M whereas the Morrison-2 M has less rainfall bias over the ocean for the majority of the cases. Overall, the present study suggests that the choice of microphysical scheme can greatly influence the accuracy of thunderstorm and lightning event predictions in operational weather forecasting models."

 This study investigates the interannual relationship of extreme precipitation days (EPD) over South China (SC) and Indochina Peninsula (ICP) with tropical Pacific-Indian Ocean Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during May, utilizing observations, reanalysis, and Coupled-Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) model outputs. The results uncover a dipole mode in the interannual variations of May EPD over SC and ICP, characterized by an east–west inverse pattern. This dipole mode is significantly attributed to large-scale circulation anomalies induced by tropical Pacific–Indian Ocean mode (PIM). During the positive phase of PIM, SST anomalies in the tropical east-central Pacific and western Indian Oceans are anomalously warm, contrasted with negative SST anomalies in the western Pacific, leading to anomalous Walker circulations. Accordingly, two robust anticyclones appear in the lower levels of the Northwest Pacific and the Bay of Bengal, respectively. The southwesterlies on the western flank of the anticyclone in the Northwest Pacific cause moisture convergence over SC, favoring the occurrence of extreme precipitation in SC. Conversely, the anticyclonic circulation centered at the Bay of Bengal is not conducive to the transport of warm water vapor from oceans to ICP, resulting in reduced occurrence of extreme precipitation there. The results derived from CMIP6 models unequivocally support the notion that the dipole mode is predominantly shaped by large-scale circulation anomalies induced by PIM. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for the collective impact of oceanic drivers in the tropics, laying a scientific foundation for enhanced precision in simulating extreme precipitation across SC and ICP."

 Global warming is rapidly changing the precipitation structure, and the shift in precipitation phases is even more pronounced in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), a region sensitive to global climate change. The accuracy of precipitation phase discrimination is essential for studying precipitation variability. Based on the observed data from 112 meteorological stations in the study area obtained from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) before 1980, we compared and assessed six methods for distinguishing precipitation phases and the optimal method was determined to complete the precipitation phase data after 1980 in the study area. Subsequently, the changes in precipitation amount, intensity, and frequency were analyzed by classifying them into light, moderate, heavy, and extreme precipitation using the percentile threshold discrimination method. It found that the dynamic threshold temperature method (presented by Ding et al., 2014) was the most effective to distinguish precipitation phases in the TP, and its performance was further improved from 80.9% to 86.1% after using frequency intersection and probability guarantee methods. Precipitation was mainly concentrated in July. Meanwhile, the proportion of snowfall to total precipitation (S/P) was approximately 9%. From 1961 to 2020, the amount of total precipitation, rainfall and snowfall in the TP exhibited increasing trends, while the sleet demonstrated a persistent decline. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity existed in the changes of precipitation of different phases. The average single precipitation amount increased. Moreover, the changes in the amount and frequency of extreme precipitation were more pronounced. Increased frequency and amount of both rainfall and snowfall were distributed in the central and eastern parts of the study area with a more significant proportion. In contrast, the peripheral areas witnessed a decrease. The spatial distribution of frequency and amount of different precipitation intensities was comparable to that of the total precipitation. This study offers novel procedure into changes of precipitation phases at high altitudes, which will inform future research on climate change and water resource management."

The downward negative DL with a 2-D development speed of 1.2–1.8 × 106 m/s from the branch outside the main channel forms the M component after being intercepted by the main channel. The current waveform of DL-M component shows a typical “hook-shaped” waveform, and the electric field waveform can be clearly divided into DL part and M component part. The waveform of the DL part decreases slower than that of the M component part. Using current measured at the channel base as input, three models were used to simulate the corresponding electric field. The DL-M model, which takes the leader process into account, gives better modelling results."

 Intensifying global hydrological cycle has led to significant changes in climate extremes. Recently, compound dry-hot extremes (CDHE) have received considerable attention due to their greater adverse impact than individual extremes. Thus, the present study aims to assess the monsoonal CDHEs over India for past and future. Here, an integrated approach using comprehensive statistical (variance transform method, regression and reliability ensemble averaging-REA) and probabilistic methods (copula) is proposed to study these extremes. The study evaluates the Standardized Compound Event Indicator (SCEI) across two distinct periods: the observed data from 1975 to 2015 and future projections for 2055–2095 under RCP8.5, to analyse the frequency and spatial extent of dry-hot extremes during the monsoon season (JJAS). Furthermore, the estimation of vegetation losses under different dry-hot conditions for 1982–2013 is examined using bivariate copulas. Also, the association of climate indices with SCEI is evaluated using variance transformation method. The results show that SCEI encompasses a negative trend during 1975–2015, which represents a rise in dry-hot extremes. Such extremes exhibit a substantial impact on vegetation, as the bivariate assessment of SCEI and NDVI show that around 65.70% of the country's area is vulnerable to vegetation loss under extreme SCEI condition. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that Nino3.4 (ENSO) is the most influential climate indice for SCEI, for >50% of country's area. Subsequently, for future (2055–2095), it is found that frequency and spatial extent of dry-hot extremes would increase relative to past (1975–2015), across the country. The present study improves the understanding of dry-hot extremes and can contribute towards effective adaptation strategy."

 Using the multivariate EOF analysis performed on the observation datasets, this study reveals that the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) has been toward warm-dry springs over most regions especially after the 2000s, accompanied by increased surface temperature and decreased precipitation anomalies. Such climate condition provides favourable environment for compound heat and drought events, raising questions about how the spring climate in GMS will change as climate warms. Based on a multi-model weighting scheme among CMIP6 models, we project the regional climate changes in GMS in a warmer world under the SSP5–8.5 scenario. Results show that the southern GMS including Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia will become warmer-drier throughout the 21st century in response to global warming. In contrast, the climate condition over the northern GMS including Myanmar and Yunnan province of Southwest China is expected to experience a transition from dry to wet springs in a warmer world, resulting in a tendency toward the warm-wet springs particularly in the long-term future. This knowledge indicates the spatial non-uniformity of regional climate under global warming and will aid in advance to plan for water management and agricultural adaptation."

 It is well realized that the planetary boundary layer (PBL) imbalance is essential for the secondary eyewall formation (SEF) in tropical cyclones (TCs). The purpose of this study is to investigate the thermodynamic processes in inducing the PBL imbalance. While the control run in an idealized simulation is capable of generating the SEF, simulations with varying fall speeds of raindrops (FSR) in the microphysics resulted in different outcomes for the formation of SEF. The SEF occurs only within a specific range of FSR relative to its default formulation in the model.The gradient wind equation in the PBL is used to diagnose the imbalance leading to SEF. In the case with a formation of SEF, a substantial downdraft induced by TC outer rainbands is observed, leading to positive agradient force (AF). Such downdraft favors the formation of a moat region. Furthermore, the adiabatic warming induced by the downdrafts also modifies the temperature field and the radial gradient of pressure field, contributing to the PBL imbalance. While previous studies have emphasized the importance of the broadening of tangential wind as a trigger for positive AF, our results highlight the importance of the local pressure gradient imbalance within the PBL."

 Previous studies on extreme precipitation events have primarily focused on the intensity of such events during fixed periods, without considering the entirety of extreme precipitation events and conducting a comprehensive examination of the intensity and frequency of more disastrous persistent extreme precipitation (PEP) events. In this paper, persistent extreme precipitation indices (PEPIs) related to intensity, frequency, duration, and contribution rates were constructed, utilizing a gridded daily precipitation dataset and atmospheric circulation indices data from China for the period 1961–2022 to analyze the spatial distribution, spatiotemporal trends, and seasonal patterns and variations of PEPIs across different regions of China and the potential impact of the dynamic factors on the spatiotemporal variations of PEPIs. The results are crucial for effectively predicting future changes and informing planning for adaptation strategies: From 1961 to 2022, (1) China's PEP pattern displays distinct regional variations. PEP has been prevalent in Western Arid (Semi-Arid) Zone (WAS) and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QT) regions, with higher occurrence frequency, duration, and contribution rates to total extreme precipitation (44.91% and 42.01%) and overall precipitation (26.35% and 29.08%). Conversely, the humid eastern regions exhibit greater event intensity. (2) Intensity-related PEPIs show a significant increase, while the frequency and contribution rate-related PEPIs tend to decrease, indicating less frequent but more concentrated PEP events. (3) Seasonal distribution of PEP events shows a primary concentration in QT, North China (N), the Eastern arid zone (EA), and Northeast China (NE) from June to September and they occur more frequently during spring and summer in Central (C) and South China (S) regions. Summer variations predominantly account for annual PEP variability and trends. (4) WPSHII, SCSSHII, WPWPSII, APVII, NHPVII, NINO3 predominantly affect the WAS, QT, NE, C, and S regions, with WPSHII having the broadest impact, notably on the QT, C, S, and NE regions.

 Large-scale climate oscillations are the main forcings affecting regional meteorological droughts and being relevant to sources of their predictability. However, the physical mechanism of atmospheric teleconnections with respect to regional droughts is still not fully understood. In this study, a univariate-to-multivariate analysis framework is proposed to disentangle the spatially combined and temporally lagged effects of multiple oceanic-atmospheric oscillations on meteorological droughts at regional scale. Our study focuses on the largest freshwater lake basin of China, the Poyang Lake basin (PLB). Pearson's correlation coefficient and cross-wavelet transform are used to analyze the pair-wise linear and non-linear correlations between droughts and each climate oscillation. Random forests model is used to reveal the combined influences of multiple climate oscillations. The associated atmospheric mechanism for the identified combination of climate indices with changing lags is explored by performing composite analysis. Regarding the spatially combined influences, the concurrence of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are the most important drought precursors. Regarding the temporally lagged influences, ENSO with lag of 11 months and NAO with lag of 2–3 months trigger meteorological droughts. The combined effect of preceding winter El Niño and late-summer negative NAO is the primary cause for triggering autumn droughts. The positive Eurasian teleconnection pattern, triggered by ENSO and NAO and favorable for anomalous northerly currents, is the main drought-prone circulation pattern for the PLB. These findings contribute to improved understanding of joint effects of lagged teleconnections for meteorological droughts, which could eventually lead to more skillful seasonal drought forecasting."

 A record-breaking heavy rainfall event struck North China from 29 July to 1 August 2023, during which the southwest mountain region of Beijing city recorded a rainfall amount over 2 times that of its eastern plain region. Based on multisource observations and convection-permitting numerical simulations, this study analyzes the thermal structure in these regions and its impact on precipitation. The rainfall was caused by a deep extratropical cyclone, which produced strong low-level southeast winds that transported abundant warm moist air toward North China. The light rainfall on 29 July caused extensive evaporation and cooling, and the increase in low-level easterly wind led to uneven heating in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) during the following two days. The PBL over mountains was significantly colder than over plains. The WRF model reasonably reproduces the evolution of rainfall, but with a dry bias. The simulated differences in rainfall amount and temperature between two regions are similar to the observations. The diagnosis of the vertical momentum budget attributes the enhancement of updrafts to horizontal convergence within the PBL, which mainly resulted from the deceleration of easterly wind over the windward slope. The simulated maximum temperature gradient occurred in the strongest convergence zone. Furthermore, the force analysis indicates the important role played by the thermal contrast in the deceleration of PBL easterly wind. The thermal contrast forced a mountain breeze effect, which together with the topographic blocking significantly decelerated the easterly wind and further enhanced updrafts and rainfall over mountainous regions."

However, this assumption is not generally valid, leading to misleading characterization results. Interfacial evaporators yield larger evaporation rates in dark conditions due to enlarged liquid-vapor surface areas, resulting in increased evaporative cooling and larger environmental temperature differentials. Theoretical and experimental evidence is provided, which shows that these temperature differences invalidate the equal energy input assumption. The results indicate that differences in evaporation rates correspond to energy input variations, without requiring enthalpy to be reduced below theoretical values. These findings offer alternative explanations for previous claims of reduced vaporization enthalpy and contradict enthalpy-related conclusions drawn from differential scanning calorimetry. We conclude that postulating a reduced vaporization enthalpy using the dark environment method is inaccurate and that re-evaluation of vaporization enthalpy reduction is required."

ACSL6 promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion mediated by IL-18, independent of its metabolic enzyme activity. Mechanistically, upon IL-18 stimulation, ACSL6 is phosphorylated by ERK2 at S674 and recruits IL-18RAP to interact with IL-18R1, thereby reinforcing the IL-18R1–IL-18RAP heterodimer and triggering NF-κB–dependent gene expression to facilitate tumor development.

Software-wise, leveraging this, we propose an off-chip training method to adjust deep neural network parameters, achieving accurate AiMC inference. We validate this approach with MAC operations, showing improved transfer curve linearity and reduced errors. By emulating large-scale neural network models, our codesigned MTJ-based AiMC closely matches software baseline accuracy and outperforms existing off-chip training methods, highlighting MTJ’s potential in AI tasks."

This RNA binding protein specifically binds to pri/pre-microRNA (miRNA) lethal-7 (let-7), impeding its miRNA maturation. The reduced expression of tumor suppressor miRNA let-7 fosters development and progression-related traits such as proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. We report a series of miRNA-based Lin28A-miRNA proteolysis-targeting chimeras (Lin28A-miRNA-PROTACs) designed to efficiently degrade Lin28A through a ubiquitin-proteasome–dependent mechanism, resulting in up-regulation of mature let-7 family.

In a recognition memory task, a notable fraction of hippocampal neurons showed that rate modulation strongly correlated with recognition performance. During free navigation in an open arena, spatial view, rather than position, predominantly influenced the spatial selectivity of hippocampal neurons. Neurons selective for recognition memory displayed minimal spatial tuning, while spatially tuned neurons exhibited limited memory-related activity. These neural correlates of recognition memory and space were more pronounced in the anterior and posterior portions of the hippocampus, respectively. These opposing gradients extended further into the anterior and posterior neocortices.

We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses.

Changes in tillage intensity have a profound impact on soil nitrogen cycling, yet their influence on nitrate losses at large spatiotemporal scales remains uncertain. This study examined the effects of tillage intensity on soil nitrate losses in the US Midwest from 1979–2018 using field data synthesis and process-based agroecosystem modeling approaches. Our results revealed that no-tillage (NT) or reduced tillage intensity (RTI) decreased nitrate runoff but increased nitrate leaching compared to conventional tillage. These trade-offs were largely caused by altered water fluxes, which elevated total nitrate losses. The structural equation model suggested that precipitation had more pronounced effects on nitrate leaching and runoff than soil properties (i.e. texture, pH, and bulk density). Reduction in nitrate runoff under NT or RTI was negatively correlated with precipitation, and the increased nitrate leaching was positively associated with soil bulk density. We further explored the combined effects of NT or RTI and winter cover crops and found that incorporating winter cover crops into NT systems effectively reduced nitrate runoff but did not significantly affect nitrate leaching. Our findings underscore the precautions of implementing NT or RTI to promote sustainable agriculture under changing climate conditions. This study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between tillage intensity and nitrate loss pathways, contributing to informed decision-making in climate-smart agriculture."

Additionally, we present a novel tracer transport scheme for the sea ice coupled model and demonstrate that this scheme fulfills the requirements for conservation, accuracy, efficiency, and monotonicity in an idealized test. Our new coupled model also has good performance in realistic tests. 
 As the demand for increased resolution and complexity in unstructured sea ice models is growing, higher demands are also placed on the sea ice transport scheme. In this study, we couple the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydro-science Integrated System Model (SCHISM, v5.11) with Icepack (v1.3.4), the column physics package of the Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE); a key step is to implement a total variation diminishing (TVD) transport scheme for the multi-class sea ice module in the coupled model. Compared with the second-order upwind scheme and the finite-element flux-corrected transport (FEM-FCT) scheme, the TVD transport scheme is overall superior when evaluated based on conservation, accuracy, efficiency (even with very high resolution), and strict monotonicity. Although it is slightly weaker than FEM-FCT in terms of accuracy alone, the TVD scheme still outperforms the other two schemes in comprehensive performance. The new coupled model outperforms the existing single-class ice model of SCHISM in the case of Lake Superior. For the Arctic Ocean case, it successfully reproduces the long-term changes in the sea ice extent,  sea ice boundary, concentration observations from satellites, and thickness from in situ measurement."

It creates layers of snow accumulation at fixed times during the simulation, which are used to model the internal stratification of the ice sheet. Together with reconstructed isochrones from radiostratigraphy data, ELSA can be used to assess ice sheet models and to improve their parameterization. ELSA can be used coupled to an ice sheet model or forced with its output. 
 We provide a detailed description of the ice-sheet layer age tracer Englacial Layer Simulation Architecture (ELSA) – a model that uses a straightforward method to simulate the englacial stratification of large ice sheets – as an alternative to Eulerian or Lagrangian tracer schemes. ELSA's vertical axis is time, and individual layers of accumulation are modeled explicitly and are isochronal. ELSA is not a standalone ice-sheet model but requires unidirectional coupling to another model providing ice physics and dynamics (the “host model”). Via ELSA's layer tracing, the host model’s output can be evaluated throughout the interior using ice core or radiostratigraphy data. We describe the stability and resolution dependence of this coupled modeling system using simulations of the last glacial cycle of the Greenland ice sheet using one specific host model. Key questions concern ELSA's design to maximize usability, which includes making it computationally efficient enough for ensemble runs, as well as exploring the requirements for offline forcing of ELSA with output from a range of existing ice-sheet models.

Here we illustrate the spurious effect that tides can have on simulations of south-east Asia. Although they play an important role in determining the state of the ocean, they can increase numerical errors and make simulation outputs less realistic. We also provide insights into how to reduce these errors. 
 The role of mixing between layers of different densities is key to how the ocean works and interacts with other components of the Earth's system. Correctly accounting for its effect in numerical simulations is therefore of utmost importance. However, numerical models are still plagued with spurious sources of mixing, originating mostly from the vertical advection schemes in the case of fixed-coordinate models. As the number of phenomena explicitly resolved by models increases, so does the amplitude of resolved vertical motions and the amount of spurious numerical mixing, and regional models are no exception to this. This paper provides a clear illustration of this phenomenon in the context of simulating the south-east Asian (SEA) seas along with a simple way to reduce its impact. This region is known for its particularly strong internal tides and the fundamental role they play in the dynamic of the region. Using the Symphonie ocean model, simulations including and excluding tides and using a pseudo-third-order upwind advection scheme on the vertical are compared to several reference datasets, and the impact on water masses is assessed. The high diffusivity of this advection scheme is demonstrated along with the importance of accounting for tidal mixing for a correct representation of water masses. Simultaneously, we present an improvement in this advection scheme to make it more suitable for use in the vertical. Simulations with the new formulation are added for comparison. We conclude that the use of a higher-order numerical diffusion operator greatly improves the overall performance of the model."

We find that our model is able to capture the distribution of precipitation very well but suffers from overestimating the precipitation amounts over high elevation.

 Using the regionally refined mesh (RRM) configuration of the US Department of Energy's Simple Cloud-Resolving Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model (SCREAM), we simulate and evaluate four meteorologically distinct atmospheric river events over California.  We test five different RRM configurations, each differing in terms of the areal extent of the refined mesh and the resolution (ranging from 800 m to 3.25 km).  We find that SCREAM RRM generally has a good representation of the AR-generated precipitation in CA, even for the control simulation which has a very small 3 km refined patch, and is able to capture the fine-scale regional distributions that are controlled largely by the fine-scale topography of the state.  It is found that SCREAM generally has a wet bias over topography, most prominently over the Sierra Nevada mountain range, with a corresponding dry bias on the lee side.  We find that refining the resolution beyond 3 km (specifically 1.6 km and 800 m) has virtually no benefit towards reducing systematic precipitation biases but that improvements can be found when increasing the areal extent of the upstream refined mesh.  However, these improvements are relatively modest and only realized if the size of the refined mesh is expanded to the scale where employing RRM no longer achieves the substantial cost benefit it was intended for."

Considerable attention has been devoted to defining the scope of environmental laws protecting watercourses. Yet how these definitions are implemented through regulatory mapping, the cartography of waterbodies that legally qualify as watercourses and are thus protected, has not been examined outside of the United States. Here, we demonstrate the consequences of regulatory mapping on the extent of river networks that are protected, using France as a case study. By assembling the first map of France’s watercourses protected under the Water Law, we estimate that a quarter of previously mapped hydrographic segments were excluded from protection and found stark geographical variations in the extent of protected ecosystems. Headwater and nonperennial segments are disproportionately excluded by 28% compared to their prevalence (67%) in the overall hydrographic network, with potentially far-reaching implications for biodiversity and people.

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was predominant in both air and soil with a strong correlation, highlighting air deposition as an important source in the terrestrial system. PFAS concentrations in wheat decreased in the stem and ear but increased in the leaves as wheat matured. Specifically, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) dominated in the aboveground tissues in the full-life-cycle, except that PFOA surpassed and became predominant in leaves during the filling and maturing stages, hinting at an airborne source. For all PFAS, both bioaccumulation factors and translocation factors (TFs) were inversely correlated with the carbon chain length during the full-life-cycle. The obtained TF values were considerably higher than those obtained from ambient sites reported previously, further suggesting an unneglectable foliar uptake from air, which was estimated to be 25% for PFOA.

Despite its environmental significance, limited knowledge exists regarding the photosensitivity of permafrost-derived carbon in these ponds. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to explore the photochemical transformations of organic matter in surface water samples from thermokarst ponds from different environments in northern Quebec, Canada. One pond near Kuujjuarapik is characterized by the presence of a collapsing palsa and is therefore organically rich, while the other pond near Umiujaq is adjacent to a collapsing lithalsa and thus contains fewer organic matters. Photobleaching occurred in the Umiujaq sample upon irradiation, whereas the Kuujjuarapik sample exhibited an increase in light absorbance at wavelength related to aromatic functionalities, indicating different photochemical aging processes. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry analysis reveals that the Kuujjuarapik sample preferentially photoproduced highly unsaturated CHO compounds with great aromaticity, while the irradiated Umiujaq sample produced a higher proportion of CHON aromatics with reduced nitrogen functionalities. Overall, this study illustrates that the photochemical reactivity of thermokarst pond water varies with the source of organic matter. The observed differences in reactivity contribute to an improved understanding of the photochemical emission of volatile organic compounds discovered earlier.

This is primarily due to the competitive reaction between C3H6 and NH3, which compete for the NH3 reductant required in the NH3–SCR reaction, resulting in the production of HCN. The unfavorable effect is alleviated on the modified catalysts due to their enhanced oxidation capabilities toward C3H6 and the HCHO intermediate, facilitating the complete oxidation of C3H6 to COx.

In this study, we used laboratory gene expression and behavior data from two populations of Atlantic killifish Fundulus heteroclitus [one reference site (SCOKF) and one PCB-contaminated site (NBHKF)] to inform individual-based models simulating cohort growth and survival from embryonic exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations of neurotoxicants. Methylmercury exposed SCOKF exhibited brain gene expression changes in the si:ch211–186j3.6, si:dkey-21c1.4, scamp1, and klhl6 genes, which coincided with changes in feeding and swimming behaviors, but our models simulated no growth or survival effects of exposures. PCB126-exposed SCOKF had lower physical activity levels coinciding with a general upregulation in nucleic and cellular brain gene sets (BGS) and downregulation in signaling, nucleic, and cellular BGS. The NBHKF, known to be tolerant to PCBs, had altered swimming behaviors that coincided with 98% fewer altered BGS. Our models simulated PCB126 decreased growth in SCOKF and survival in SCOKF and NBHKF. Overall, our study provides a unique demonstration linking molecular and behavioral data to develop quantitative, testable predictions of ecological risk."

However, the underlying physical mechanisms of this cold wave, and the extent to which it is driven by internal variability or external forcing, are not fully understood. Using ERA5 reanalysis data and the HadGEM3‐A‐N216 attribution simulations, we identified internal variability as the main cause, contributing −5.14 K to surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies in North America. External forcing slightly mitigated the cold by 0.42 K. An internally generated wave train from the North Pacific, influenced in combination by Pacific‐North American (PNA) and North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) teleconnection patterns, initiated this intense cyclonic event, contributing −2.18 K and −2.12 K to SAT anomalies, respectively.

We extract rotating fluid features that maintain structural coherence over time for near‐neutral, transitional, and convective boundary layers. In contrast to traditional analysis of coherent structures in turbulent boundary layers, we provide the first identification of vortex boundaries that are mathematically defined to behave as tracer transport barriers. Furthermore, these vortices are indifferent to the choice of observer reference frame and can be identified without user‐dependent velocity field decompositions. We find a strong agreement between the geometric qualities of the coherent structures we extract using our new method and classical descriptions of horizontal rolls and convective cells arising from decades of observational studies. We also quantify trends in individual vortex contributions to turbulent and advective fluxes of heat under varying atmospheric stability. Using recently developed tools from the theory of transport barrier fields, we compare diffusive momentum and heat barrier fields with the presence of rolls and cells, and determine a strong connection between heat and momentum orthogonality with the physical drivers of roll‐cell transformation. This newly employed frame‐indifferent characterization of coherent turbulent structures can be directly applied to numerical model output, and thus provides a new Lagrangian approach to understand complex scale‐dependent processes and their associated dynamics."

 After injury, mammalian spinal cords develop scars to confine the lesion and prevent further damage. However, excessive scarring can hinder neural regeneration and functional recovery1,2. These competing actions underscore the importance of developing therapeutic strategies to dynamically modulate scar progression. Previous research on scarring has primarily focused on astrocytes, but recent evidence has suggested that ependymal cells also participate. Ependymal cells normally form the epithelial layer encasing the central canal, but they undergo massive proliferation and differentiation into astroglia following certain injuries, becoming a core scar component3–7. However, the mechanisms regulating ependymal proliferation in vivo remain unclear. Here we uncover an endogenous κ-opioid signalling pathway that controls ependymal proliferation. Specifically, we detect expression of the κ-opioid receptor, OPRK1, in a functionally under-characterized cell type known as cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neuron (CSF-cN). We also discover a neighbouring cell population that expresses the cognate ligand prodynorphin (PDYN). Whereas κ-opioids are typically considered inhibitory, they excite CSF-cNs to inhibit ependymal proliferation. Systemic administration of a κ-antagonist enhances ependymal proliferation in uninjured spinal cords in a CSF-cN-dependent manner. Moreover, a κ-agonist impairs ependymal proliferation, scar formation and motor function following injury. Together, our data suggest a paracrine signalling pathway in which PDYN+ cells tonically release κ-opioids to stimulate CSF-cNs and suppress ependymal proliferation, revealing an endogenous mechanism and potential pharmacological strategy for modulating scarring after spinal cord injury. Paracrine κ-opioid signalling among cells surrounding the spinal cord central canal modulates scar formation after injury."

 Hotspot lavas exhibit chemical heterogeneity, much of which is ascribed to heterogeneous deep mantle sources that contain various components with distinct composition, origin and age. However, characterizing primary melt compositions and mantle heterogeneity directly is challenging. Here we investigate a global dataset of hotspot lavas to constrain the incompatible-element composition of their parental melts and sources. Trace-element ratios indicate that the compositional heterogeneity of global hotspot lavas is not primary, but reflects processes that hotspot melts undergo as they ascend to the surface. We find the parental melts of these lavas, as well as of kimberlites and basalts from large igneous provinces, to be uniform in their elemental, and radiogenic and noble-gas isotope, composition. We suggest that the parental melts to all of these lavas derive from a depleted and outgassed mantle reservoir that was replenished with incompatible element-enriched material during the Archaean. This interpretation explains the elemental, radiogenic and noble-gas isotope compositions of hotspot lavas without requiring a heterogeneous lower mantle or the long-term survival of undegassed relics from a primordial Earth.

 Water can be dynamically over-compressed well into the stability field of ice VII. Whether water then transforms into ice VII, vitreous ice or a metastable novel crystalline phase remained uncertain. We report here the freezing of over-compressed water to ice VII by time-resolved X-ray diffraction. Quasi-isothermal dynamic compression paths are achieved using a dynamic-piezo-Diamond-Anvil-Cell, with programmable pressure rise time from 0.1 ms to 100 ms. By combining the present data set with those obtained on various ns-dynamical platforms, a complete evolution of the solidification pressure of metastable water versus the compression rate is rationalized within the classical nucleation theory framework. Also, when crystallization into ice VII occurs in between 1.6 GPa and 2.0 GPa, that is in the stability field of ice VI, a structural evolution over few ms is then observed into a mixture of ice VI and ice VII that seems to resolve apparent contradictions between previous results.

 Despite the increasing relevance of temperature overshoot and the rather ambitious country pledges on Afforestation/Reforestation globally, the mitigation potential and the Earth system responses to large-scale non-idealized Afforestation/Reforestation patterns under a high overshoot scenario remain elusive. Here, we develop an ambitious Afforestation/Reforestation scenario by harnessing 1259 Integrated Assessment Model scenarios, restoration potential maps, and biodiversity constraints, reaching 595 Mha by 2060 and 935 Mha by 2100. We then force the Max Planck Institute’s Earth System Model with this scenario which yields a reduction of peak temperature by 0.08 oC, end-of-century temperature by 0.2 oC, and overshoot duration by 13 years. Afforestation/Reforestation in the range of country pledges globally could thus constitute a useful mitigation tool in overshoot scenarios in addition to fossil fuel emission reductions, but socio-ecological implications need to be scrutinized to avoid severe side effects.

 Warming seas are expected to drive marine life poleward. However, few systematic observations confirm movement among entire communities at both warm and cool range edges. We analysed two continent-scale reef monitoring datasets to quantify changes in latitudinal range edges of 662 Australian shallow-water reef fishes and invertebrates over a decade punctuated by climate extremes. Temperate and tropical species both showed little net movement overall, with retreat often balancing expansion across the continent. Within regions, however, range edges shifted ~100 km per decade, on average, in the poleward or equatorward directions expected from warming or cooling. Although some species responded rapidly to temperature change, we found little evidence for mass poleward migration over the decade. Previous studies based on extreme species observations, rather than tracking all species through time, may have overestimated the prevalence, magnitude and longevity of range shifts amongst marine taxa.

 To attain sustainable development goals and understand urban growth patterns, continuous and precise monitoring of built-up area heights is essential. This helps reveal how urban form evolution impacts the thermal environment. Previous research often used isolated images, ignoring the temporal dimension of thermal infrared and reflectance data from Landsat sensors. Additionally, cost-effective and efficient methods for reconstructing time-series built height are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized Landsat time-series data to reconstruct the yearly trends in urban form in Beijing, China, spanning from 1990 to 2020. Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time series analysis method was used to identify urban growth and renewal years. Employing a reference height for 2020 and logical reasoning method, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights, pinpointing years of significant change. Finally, we analyzed the alterations in urban form over the past three decades and their impact on surface temperature changes. Our change detection method achieved an overall accuracy of 86 %, demonstrating its effectiveness in determining the year of change. When compared with data from Lianjia and LiDAR point cloud, our height reconstruction method showed impressive accuracy, with R2 values of 0.9773 and 0.9526, respectively. Analysis of summer and winter LST values revealed distinct temperature patterns across different building heights, with mid-rise buildings exhibiting the highest LST in summer and low-rise buildings registering the highest LST in winter. During periods of urban growth, both mean and amplitude values of LST increased, while during urban renewal (demolition), they decreased.

 Well-facilitated farmland (WFF) construction is greatly responsible for agricultural sustainable development. How to quantitatively plan the WFF construction distribution and schedule is still challenging. This study thus introduced a simple but robust method, and took the typical dryland Yulin city to spatially identify its potential WFF construction areas and temporally determine construction priorities based on public data. By integrating satellite-observed croplands with survey-based statistical data, this study firstly obtained density maps of constant croplands. We found that constant cropland densities decreased from west to east in Yulin city. Jingbian and Dingbian counties of the west gave relatively dense distributions. Secondly, by overlaying evaluation indictors of WFF construction, we found over 96% of constant croplands had WFF construction potentials. Slope and fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) showed evidently spatial differences, which comprehensively reflected the potentials and difficulties of WFF construction. Therefore, an index SF, by considering normalized slope and FVC, was subsequently introduced to rank potential WFF construction priorities. According to the completion ratio and the assumption that giving priorities to develop better basic condition regions, batches of WFF construction areas were identified under the equal proportion planning scenario for each county (S1). Besides, a scenario of city-wide unified planning (S2) was also discussed. WFF construction areas in S2 were further concentrated in northwestern counties compared to those in S1. Both scenarios recommended that construction priorities were given to northwestern counties. This study could provide valuable references for arranging distributions and schedules of WFF construction."

 To study chemical characteristics, sources and formation mechanisms of PM2.5 during the Spring Festival (SF), 39 elements, 9 water–soluble ions (WSIs) and 8 fractions of carbonaceous species in PM2.5 and PM10 at two sites in Kunming were investigated. The results indicated that the average mass concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 were 61.03 ± 25.11 and 80.48 ± 30.08 μg/m3 in the urban area, and 18.96 ± 4.66 and 56.76 ± 21.69 μg/m3 in the suburban area, respectively.

 This paper uses 28 years of satellite altimeter fusion data from 1993 to 2020 to identify and track the mesoscale eddies in the South China Sea based on the Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) closed contour method, with the goal of improving our overall understanding of mesoscale eddy activities in the South China Sea and further investigating the ocean dynamic processes in the region, so as to provide fundamental data for climate change studies. The study examined the spatiotemporal distribution, generation and demise, and movement trajectories of the eddies. Furthermore, key parameters including velocity, vortex radius, amplitude and Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) were analyzed, with a particular emphasis on the seasonal changes and mechanisms that influence EKE in two areas of the South China Sea with high energy values. The South China Sea has more cyclonic eddies than anticyclonic eddies, according to the study, and its eastern region is primarily home to high-frequency generating areas. However, the majority of the vortices will eventually dissipate in the western and central areas of the South China Sea. Furthermore, vortices usually flow farther to the west. With decreasing latitude, the eddy radius and EKE distribution gradually increase, whereas the amplitude is contrary. EKE is caused by the interaction of factors including wind field driving, seawater movement, and circulation. Seasonal changes in the EKE occur near the Luzon Strait, and the sea area east of the south in Vietnam exhibits clear characteristics."

 The Asian-Pacific Oscillation (APO), featuring a seesaw pattern in the upper-tropospheric temperatures between Asia and the North Pacific, plays profound roles in the Northern Hemispheric climate anomalies. So, its variability and associated physical mechanisms are of great interest. Although progress has been achieved for the APO variability at the interannual time scale, the understanding of its interdecadal variability remains relatively poor. Based on the twentieth-century reanalysis and the simulations of the preindustrial control, Pacific pacemaker, and large ensemble experiments, this study reports a salient contribution of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) to the interdecadal variability of the APO during summer, featured as a warm (cold) PDO phase accompanying a negative (positive) APO polarity. During the warm PDO phase, the sea surface temperature (SST) warming over the eastern Pacific is conducive to local ascending anomalies, which teleconnect with descending anomalies over the Tibetan Plateau through zonal vertical circulations. The anomalous ascent (descent) over the eastern Pacific (Tibetan Plateau) tends to strengthen (weaken) the atmospheric heating, beneficial for a warming (cooling) of the troposphere in situ. In addition, the PDO-related meridional SST gradient anomalies favor a southward shift of the subtropical jet stream, weakening the South Asian high and the North Pacific trough in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to the atmospheric situation of a negative APO phase. Quantitative analysis from the large ensemble simulations indicates that the PDO may contribute to approximately 48% of recent APO interdecadal variation from the negative phase to the positive phase in the late 1990s."

 Induced by numerous environmental and anthropogenic factors, the frequency of compound hot extremes (CoHot) is increasing globally. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the relative importance of different factors in the change of CoHot, as most studies focused solely on individual factors. We systematically attribute the long-term trends of summertime CoHot in China to 24 factors including climate background, climate change, urbanization (including impervious area expansion and three-dimensional urban morphology), and vegetation change, using partial least square regression (PLSR) and variable importance projections for analysis. Cross-evaluation results based on 2259 meteorological stations indicate that the PLSR model accurately simulates the trends of CoHot frequency, duration, and intensity, with a relative error of 4–20% from national to individual station scales. A warm and humid climate background, rising average summertime temperatures, impervious area expansions, high building volume densities, low building heights, and vegetation wilting are the main factors that favoring the increasing and intensifying trends of CoHot. Although summertime warming contributes the most, the significance of urbanization and vegetation greening has been growing in recent years. Urbanization's contribution increases from 9.3% on a national scale to over 40% in urban centers, mainly due to increased building volume density rather than expansions of impervious area. In northern China, vegetation greening has reduced the local increasing trends in frequency/duration of CoHot by 20% to 40%, and such mitigation effects are primarily induced by increased vegetation cover. Our results suggest that, reducing building volume density and promoting vegetation greening can mitigate the increasing risk of CoHot under global warming."

 This paper examines the temporal variability of aridity in Argentina during the period 1961–2020. Monthly data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) were used to define climate types according to the Aridity Index (AI) from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Argentina presents a variety of climates ranging from arid and semiarid to subhumid and humid, suggesting simultaneous water deficit and excess conditions. However, an aridity increase in the past six decades has been observed in much of the country, contrasting with reduced areas that have become wetter. Since these changes were not uniform across the study area, a regional-level analysis was conducted to adequately capture the aridity temporal patterns, including trends, jumps, seasonality, and cycles. In general, there was a decrease in the annual AI in most regions, with non-linear patterns such as long-term oscillations, shorter-duration cycles, and abrupt variations in the average. Seasonal aridity changes showed variabilities according to the season, with higher humidity during summer and autumn, and greater aridity during winter and spring. Simultaneously, seasonal AI experienced periodic behavior with significant arid and humid cycles alternating every 10–15 years. These findings highlight the complexity of climate changes, which vary by region and season."

In this work, we disclose a facile oxidative addition and decarbonylation sequence that forms monoalkylnickel(II) intermediates through a nonradical process.

We found three distinct regimes as a function of doping and interaction strength: a weakly correlated metal, a correlated metal with strong interaction effects, and a pseudogap regime at low doping. We show that the pseudogap forms both at weak coupling, when the magnetic correlation length is large, and at strong coupling, when it is shorter.

Guided by biophysical and structural studies of ternary complexes, we designed a heterobifunctional small molecule that potently degrades 13 out of 17 of the most prevalent oncogenic KRAS alleles. Compared with inhibition, KRAS degradation results in more profound and sustained pathway modulation across a broad range of KRAS mutant cell lines, killing cancer cells while sparing models without genetic KRAS aberrations.

M. E. Zucker",Squeezing the quantum noise of a gravitational-wave detector below the standard quantum limit,"The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision, giving rise to an apparent limitation known as the standard quantum limit (SQL). Gravitational-wave detectors use photons to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors and so are affected by the SQL. We investigated the performance of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) after the experimental realization of frequency-dependent squeezing designed to surpass the SQL. For the LIGO Livingston detector, we found that the upgrade reduces quantum noise below the SQL by a maximum of three decibels between 35 and 75 hertz while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, increasing the overall detector sensitivity during astrophysical observations."

We investigated germline mutations inGNAI2, which encodes Gαi2, a key component in heterotrimeric G protein signal transduction usually thought to regulate adenylyl cyclase–mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. Patients with activating Gαi2mutations had clinical presentations that included impaired immunity. Mutant Gαi2impaired cell migration and augmented responses to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. We found that mutant Gαi2influenced TCR signaling by sequestering the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–activating protein RASA2, thereby promoting RAS activation and increasing downstream extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT S6 signaling to drive cellular growth and proliferation."

Recent research has demonstrated that rats are a highly cooperative species and are motivated by others’ distress to prosocial actions, such as opening a door or pulling a chain to release trapped conspecifics. Studies of rat affect, cognition, and neural function provide compelling evidence that rats have some capacity to represent others’ needs, to instrumentally act to improve their well-being, and are thus capable of forms of targeted helping.

However, different methods are used for assessing these effects and there is little systematic quantitative evidence on diversification benefits. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between volatility of combined crop yields (denoted as standard deviation) and diversity (denoted as Shannon’s Evenness Index SEI) for standardized yield data of major crop species grown in Germany between 1977 and 2018 (winter wheat, winter barley, silage maize and winter rapeseed) at the county level. Portfolio theory was used to estimate the optimal crop area share for minimizing yield volatility. On average, results indicated a weak negative relationship between volatility and the SEI during the past decades for the case of Germany. Optimizing crop area shares for minimizing volatility reduced yield variance on average by 24% but was associated with a decrease in SEI for most counties. This was related to the finding that the stability of individual species, i.e., barley and wheat, was more effective in reducing the volatility of combined yields than the asynchronous variation in annual yields among crops. Future studies might include an increased number of crop species and consider temporal diversification effects for a more realistic assessment of the relation between yield volatility and crop diversity and test the relationship in other regions and production conditions."

This study evaluates the changes in drought-induced crop yield loss risk for six crops (alfalfa, barley, corn, soybean, spring wheat, and winter wheat) between 1971–2000 and 1991–2020 across the contiguous US. Using a copula-based probabilistic framework, our results reveal a spatially heterogeneous change in yield risk to meteorological droughts, which varies with crop types. Regional analyses identify the largest temporal decline in yield risk in the Southeast and Upper Midwest, while the Northwest and South show an increase in risk. Among the considered anthropogenic and climatic drivers of crop productivity, changes in climatic variables such as high temperatures (e.g., killing degree days), vapor pressure deficit and precipitation show significantly stronger associations with changes in yield risk than irrigated area and nitrogen fertilizer application. Among the counties that observe drier drought events, only 55% exhibit an increase in crop yield loss risk due to drier droughts. The rest 45% show a decrease in yield loss risk due to mediation of favorable climatic and anthropogenic factors. Alarmingly, more than half (for barley and spring wheat), and one-third (for alfalfa, corn, soybean and winter wheat) of that the risk increasing regions have outsized influence on destabilizing national crop production. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, agricultural stakeholders, and decision-makers in terms of the potential ways and locations to be prioritized for enhancing local and national agricultural resilience and ensuring food security."

One region of concern is the Midwestern United States, whose agricultural productivity depends on subsurface pipes known as tile drains to improve trafficability and soil conditions for crop growth. Tile drains accomplish this by rapidly transporting surplus soil moisture and shallow groundwater from fields, resulting in reduced watershed storage. However, no work has previously examined the connection between tile drainage and streamflow drought. Here, we pose the question: does the extent of watershed-level tile drainage lead to an increased susceptibly and magnitude of streamflow droughts? To answer this, we use daily streamflow data for 122 watersheds throughout the Midwestern United States to quantify streamflow drought duration, frequency, and intensity. Using spatial multiple regression models, we find that agricultural tile drainage generates statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in streamflow drought duration and intensity while significantly reducing drought frequency. The magnitude of the effect of tile drainage on streamflow drought characteristics is similar to that of water table depth and precipitation seasonality, both of which are known to influence streamflow droughts. Furthermore, projected changes in regional precipitation characteristics will likely drive the installation of additional tile drainage. We find that for each 10% increase in tile-drained watershed area, streamflow drought duration and intensity increase by 0.03 d and 12%, respectively, while frequency decreases by 0.10 events/year. Such increases in tile drainage may lead to more severe streamflow droughts and have a detrimental effect on the socio-environmental usage of streams throughout the Midwest."

Drying, i.e. severe reduction in water flow even leading to streambed desiccation, can have a profound impact on the available aquatic habitat, biodiversity, and functions of rivers. Yet, to date, it is unclear whether similar drying events in comparable climate zones result in similar changes in ecosystem processes, such as river metabolism or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here, we synthesise the detected effects of drying on gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), as well as on the emissions of GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) in rivers and streams. We examined the current available scientific literature detailing the impact of drying on these variables when measured either in the field or in the laboratory. We extracted data from 30 studies analysing GPP and ER responses, and data on GHG emissions from another 35 studies. Then, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether the magnitude and direction of the effects varied across the systems and climate zones studied, or according to the type (natural or human-induced) and severity of drying. In general, drying enhanced GPP (under low flows) and CH4 emissions, and decreased CO2 and N2O emissions. The hydrological phases throughout streambed drying (low water flow, isolated pools, or desiccation) had differential effects on metabolism and GHG emissions. The effects of drying were generally more severe when it induced desiccation, rather than just periods of low flow. Desiccation strongly reduced GPP, likely because of the die-off of algae, while its negative effect on ER was smaller. Greater decrease in GPP than in ER under desiccation would lead to increase in CO2 emissions; our results showed accordingly that desiccation increased CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of the effects varied depending on the study type. Experimental studies conducted in micro- and mesocosms demonstrated greater effects than field studies, thus the extrapolation of results from these to real conditions should be done with caution. Overall, the effects’ direction was inconsistent across climate zones, except for the Mediterranean climate zone, where drying was showing a negative effect on both metabolism and GHG emissions. Our synthesis may contribute to identifying the worldwide trends and patterns of drying on riverine functions associated to global change impacts on river and stream ecosystems."

Engaging and collaborating with communities through the design process enables wider community acceptance and ownership of WASH interventions, ensures a more functional and impactful design, and opens the door for co-benefits of these systems. Accounting for a range of dimensions within a community is critical to creating WASH designs that provide the most benefits. Undergraduate engineering curriculums focus on design, but often do not explicitly account for the social, environmental, and economic elements that affect the success, efficacy, and sustainability of a design. There is increasing emphasis on educating engineers on sustainability and systems thinking so they are equipped to solve complex, multidisciplinary problems. To understand how social, environmental, and economic elements fit into engineering design and how to create sustainable WASH interventions, undergraduate engineering students benefit from participating in WASH design projects that engage and collaborate with communities. This perspective highlights the value of community engagement with partners in Uganda in teaching water resources and environmental engineering design to undergraduate civil engineering students."

However, the consistency and origins of such climate patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific regions is currently under debate. Here, we propose a probabilistic explanation for episodic ecological events based on the likelihood of multiple climate patterns converging in a particular phase combination. To illustrate, we apply this model to continental scale facultative migration of seed-eating finches out of the boreal forest. This irruption phenomenon is triggered by seed crop failures stemming from two weakly correlated climate patterns occurring simultaneously in their positive phases—the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO). The joint probability of NAO and NPO both being positive (above upper tercile) is about , illustrating a simple probabilistic explanation for quasi-decadal finch irruption and potentially other episodic ecological events in regions affected by multiple climate modes."

However, the extent to which these positive effects counteract the negative effects of heightened aridity on vegetation productivity remains uncertain. Here, we used space-for-time substitution to assess the responses of 15 ecosystem variables to aridity in China’s drylands and predicted vegetation productivity under future aridity, temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition, and CO2. The results showed that vegetation productivity decreased abruptly as aridity (1-precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) increased to the threshold of 0.7, which corresponds to the vegetation decline stage in the dryland ecosystem’s response to increasing aridity. Future projections suggest that 12.8% of China’s drylands will cross aridity thresholds (0.7, 0.8, and 0.95) by 2100, in which vegetation productivity will significantly increase by 40.0%. Elevated CO2 will stimulate vegetation growth, but continuously rising temperature and CO2 by 2100 will have adverse effects, particularly in regions with limited nitrogen and water. This study suggests that effective adaptation and mitigation actions should be developed for regions crossing aridity thresholds, to ensure that drylands maintain the capacity to provide essential ecosystem services required to support the increasing population."

Therefore, in artificial weather modification operations, parameters such as the height, thickness, and operating temperature of the target cloud can be obtained through detection. These parameters can be used to automatically calculate the appropriate sowing time, sowing height, and sowing dosage to improve the accuracy of artificial catalytic cloud operations. 
 Current weather modification rockets with a single operation mode, limited operating height, and fixed and uncontrollable operating time cannot achieve seeding in different layers, stages, and quantities for different cloud systems. Therefore, a temporally controllable weather modification rocket with spatial seeding capability is developed in this study. This new rocket features an electronic fuse-controlled intelligent ignition system, with eight channels of ignition tube outputs. Additionally, carrier wave communication technology is incorporated to set the seeding time for eight sets of ignition tubes. The temporally controllable rocket is capable of initiating seeding within 2–26 s and can conduct operations for layering, arbitrary altitude, and fractional-dose seeding within the altitude range of 500–5500 m (at a launch angle of 70°), which is calculated based on the flight trajectory of rockets. The minimum time interval of the rocket for seeding can be set to 0.1 s, and all 48 catalyst bullets loaded in a single rocket can be launched within 0.8 s. Thus, the rocket can achieve both concentrated and continuous seeding. Consequently, during weather modification operations, the parameters such as altitude, thickness, and operating temperature of target clouds can be obtained through detection, and they can be used to automatically calculate the suitable seeding time, seeding altitude, and seeding dose by the launch control system based on the flight trajectory of rockets to improve the accuracy and scientificity of cloud catalytic operations. Ground tests show that the reliabilities of the electric ignition tube output, new electronic fuse input and output, and electronic fuse output energy all meet the design specification. The temporally controllable spatial seeding rocket can achieve adjustable and controllable seeding times for catalytic bullets, meeting the safety and reliability requirements of rockets."

Compared with the widely studied phenolic compounds, anilines have received far less assessment of their disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation potential, even though anilines and phenols likely exhibit similar reactivities on their respective aromatic rings. In this study, a suite of 19 aniline compounds with varying N- and ring-substitutions were evaluated for their formation potentials of haloacetonitriles and trihalomethanes under free chlorination and free bromination conditions. Eight of the aniline compounds formed dichloroacetonitrile at yields above 0.50%; the highest yields were observed for 4-nitroaniline, 3-chloroaniline, and 4-(methylsulfonyl)aniline (1.6–2.3%). Free bromination generally resulted in greater haloacetonitrile yields with the highest yield observed for 2-ethylaniline (6.5%). The trihalomethane yields of anilines correlated with their haloacetonitrile yields. Product analysis of aniline chlorination by liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed several large-molecule DBPs, including chloroanilines, (chloro)hydroxyanilines, (chloro)benzoquinone imines, and ring-cleavage products. The product time profiles suggested that the reaction pathways include initial ring chlorination and hydroxylation, followed by the formation of benzoquinone imines that eventually led to ring cleavage. This work revealed the potential of aniline-related moieties in micropollutants as potent precursors to haloacetonitriles and other emerging large-molecule DBPs with the expected toxicity."

Trimethyl, triethyl, and tripropyl phosphates were readily absorbed and acropetally translocated, while tributyl, tripentyl, and trihexyl phosphates accumulated mainly in lateral roots. The acropetal translocation potential was negatively associated with log Kow values. Trimethyl and triethyl phosphates are less prone to biotransformation, while a total of 14 novel hydrolysis, hydroxylated, and conjugated metabolites were identified for other OPEs using nontarget analysis. The extent of hydroxylation decreases from tripropyl phosphate to trihexyl phosphate, but multiple hydroxylations occurred more frequently on longer chain OPEs. Further comparative toxicity test revealed that hydrolyzed and hydroxylated metabolites have stronger toxic effects on Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CDPK) than their parent OPEs. Dibutyl 3-hydroxybutyl phosphate particularly induces upregulation of CDPK in lateral roots of lettuce, probably associated with adenine reduction that may play an important role in the self-defense and detoxification processes. This study contributes to understanding the uptake and transformation behaviors of alkyl OPEs as well as their associations with a toxic effect on lettuce. This emphasizes the necessary evaluation of the environmental risk of the use of OPEs, particularly focusing on their hydroxylated metabolites."

Nitrate (NO3–), found in nearly all water bodies, can significantly impact the performance of 222 nm far-UVC-driven systems. This work was the first to investigate the effect of NO3– on sulfamethoxazole (SMX) photodegradation at 222 nm, finding that NO3– significantly enhances SMX degradation in different dissociated forms. Besides the hydroxyl radical (•OH), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) also played important roles in SMX degradation. With increasing NO3– concentration, the RNS contribution to SMX degradation decreased from 25.7 to 8.6% at pH 3 but increased from 1.5 to 24.7% at pH 7, since the deprotonated SMX with electron-rich groups reacted more easily with RNS. The transformation mechanisms of SMX involving isomerization, bond cleavage, hydroxylation, nitrosation, and nitration processes were proposed. 15N isotope labeling experiments showed that the RNS-induced nitrated products even became the major products of SMX in the 222 nm far-UVC/NO3– system at pH 7 and exhibited a higher toxicity than SMX itself. Further research is necessary to avoid or eliminate these toxic byproducts. This study provides valuable insights for guiding the utilization of 222 nm far-UVC for treating antibiotics in NO3–-containing water."

To explore the effects of biomass composition and fire conditions on ash Ca speciation, this study characterizes the speciation of Ca in charcoal and ash samples that were derived from different plant compartments and thermal conditions, using Ca K-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy. Results showed that biomass contains abundant organic Ca complexes, which were mineralized into fairchildite and calcite after heating at 450 to 600 °C and then CaO, as temperature increased to 750 °C. Apatite could be an abundant Ca species in fire residues if the Ca/P molar ratio of the biomass is small (<2). The mineralization of organic Ca to the identified Ca minerals during burning was negligibly affected by the oxygen level. Calcium speciation in prescribed fire residues resembled that of biomass ash burned at 550 °C with similar Ca/P molar ratios. Batch experiments showed that macronutrients (Ca, Mg, K, and P) were differentially released, as a result of different solubility of minerals in ashes and reprecipitation of minerals. The aqueous solubility of Ca, Mg, and P decreased as pH increased from 5 to 9, while K showed no pH dependency and was almost completely soluble. Results from this study improve our understanding of the chemistry of fire residues and their geochemical behaviors, which can help evaluate the impact of fire on postfire soil properties and macronutrient cycling."

The results revealed the highest bacterial diversity in sandstorm air and the lowest bacterial diversity in haze air, with markedly different community structures. Moreover,  substantial dissimilarity was detected between the communities of total bacteria and active bacteria within the sandstorm air, with less abundant bacteria dominating the active bacterial population. Selective pressure played a pivotal role in shaping the composition of active bacteria during sandstorms and the total bacterial community in hazy air, thereby enabling potential interactions between airborne microorganisms and chemical components.

Both the Arctic and Antarctic SPV were strengthened when the supercontinent Pangea broke up. The increased asymmetry of midlatitude land‐sea contrast tended to weaken the upward propagation of wavenumber‐1 planetary waves, thereby strengthening the SPV.

While prior research has established the connection between ARs, orography, and precipitation, the specific mechanisms leading to intense rainfall remain unclear. A novel methodology is introduced that quantifies the relative contribution to the total precipitation from cyclone‐induced processes and orographic processes using modifications to the Met Office Unified Model orography and microphysics parameterization scheme. Results show that the majority (63%) $(63\%)$ of storm Bronagh 's rainfall over land is attributed to cyclone‐related processes (frontal ascent and embedded convection). However, interaction of the AR associated with storm Bronagh and orography focuses more of the rain over the hills, enhancing precipitation in this region by a further 50% $50\%$. Further analysis reveals that the seeder‐feeder mechanism plays a predominant role in orographically enhanced rainfall. Accretion and riming processes occur as rain from the cyclone induced (seeder) cloud falls through the orographically induced (feeder) cloud enhancing precipitation rates. The feeder cloud formation is related to forced ascent of air within the AR over the orography. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the intricate interplay between ARs, orography, and cyclone precipitation during the landfall of extratropical cyclones. By separating the mechanisms behind heavy rainfall in the context of storm Bronagh, we quantify for the first time the effect of the seeder‐feeder effect at different heights over orography."

Exploratory modeling approaches have been developed to address these issues by exploring a wide range of possible futures and identifying those that yield consequential vulnerabilities. However, vulnerabilities are typically identified based on aggregate robustness measures that do not take full advantage of the richness of the underlying dynamics in the large ensembles of model simulations and can make it hard to identify key dynamics and/or storylines that can guide planning or further analyses. This study introduces the FRamework for Narrative Storylines and Impact Classification (FRNSIC; pronounced “forensic”): a scenario discovery framework that addresses these challenges by organizing and investigating consequential scenarios using hierarchical classification of diverse outcomes across actors, sectors, and scales, while also aiding in the selection of scenario storylines, based on system dynamics that drive consequential outcomes. We present an application of this framework to the Upper Colorado River Basin, focusing on decadal droughts and their water scarcity implications for the basin's diverse users and its obligations to downstream states through Lake Powell. We show how FRNSIC can explore alternative sets of impact metrics and drought dynamics and use them to identify drought scenario storylines, that can be used to inform future adaptation planning."

 The biological aspects of infancy within late Upper Palaeolithic populations and the role of southern refugia at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum are not yet fully understood. This study presents a multidisciplinary, high temporal resolution investigation of an Upper Palaeolithic infant from Grotta delle Mura (Apulia, southern Italy) combining palaeogenomics, dental palaeohistology, spatially-resolved geochemical analyses, direct radiocarbon dating, and traditional anthropological studies. The skeletal remains of the infant – Le Mura 1 – were directly dated to 17,320-16,910 cal BP. The results portray a biological history of the infant’s development, early life, health and death (estimated at ~72 weeks). They identify, several phenotypic traits and a potential congenital disease in the infant, the mother’s low mobility during gestation, and a high level of endogamy. Furthermore, the genomic data indicates an early spread of the Villabruna-like components along the Italian peninsula, confirming a population turnover around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, and highlighting a general reduction in genetic variability from northern to southern Italy. Overall, Le Mura 1 contributes to our better understanding of the early stages of life and the genetic puzzle in the Italian peninsula at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum.

 Ocean energy extraction is on the rise. While tides are the most predictable amongst marine renewable resources, turbulent and complex flows still challenge reliable tidal stream energy extraction and there is also uncertainty in how devices change the natural environment. To ensure the long-term integrity of emergent floating tidal turbine technologies, advances in field measurements are required to capture multiscale, real-world flow interactions. Here we use aerial drones and acoustic profiling transects to quantify the site- and scale-dependent complexities of actual turbulent flows around an idled, utility-scale floating tidal turbine (20 m rotor diameter, D). The combined spatial resolution of our baseline measurements is sufficiently high to quantify sheared, turbulent inflow conditions (reversed shear profiles, turbulence intensity >20%, and turbulence length scales > 0.4D). We also detect downstream velocity deficits (approaching 20% at 4D) and trace the far-wake propagation using acoustic backscattering techniques in excess of 30D. Addressing the energy-environment nexus, our oceanographic lens on flow characterisation will help to validate multiscale flow physics around offshore energy platforms that have thus far only been simulated.

 Determining the genetic architecture of Alzheimer’s disease pathologies can enhance mechanistic understanding and inform precision medicine strategies. Here, we perform a genome-wide association study of cortical tau quantified by positron emission tomography in 3046 participants from 12 independent studies. The CYP1B1-RMDN2 locus is associated with tau deposition. The most significant signal is at rs2113389, explaining 4.3% of the variation in cortical tau, while APOE4 rs429358 accounts for 3.6%. rs2113389 is associated with higher tau and faster cognitive decline. Additive effects, but no interactions, are observed between rs2113389 and diagnosis, APOE4, and amyloid beta positivity. CYP1B1 expression is upregulated in AD. rs2113389 is associated with higher CYP1B1 expression and methylation levels. Mouse model studies provide additional functional evidence for a relationship between CYP1B1 and tau deposition but not amyloid beta.

Here we present six new radioisotopic age constraints from the Sultanate of Oman, which furnish a quantitative temporal framework for biogeochemical changes associated with animal radiation in the middle and late Ediacaran Period.

Our new dates quantify early Ediacaran (prior to c. 574 million years ago) condensation in key sections across Gondwanan margins.

 The temporal stability of aboveground net primary productivity is generally regulated by plant community structure and species diversity. There are recurring debates on the mechanisms by which environmental changes impact productivity stability in semiarid steppes. Here we revealed that plant community structure, rather than species diversity, regulates productivity stability in a semiarid Steppe. We conducted a decade-long in situ warming and precipitation addition experiment in a semiarid steppe in Inner Mongolia, China, to monitor plant productivity, species asynchrony, species diversity, and stability. We found that Leymus chinensis productivity increased and the Shannon–Wiener decreased under warming conditions, while Stipa krylovii productivity decreased under precipitation addition. Warming reduced the stability of Stipa krylovii and the plant community stability, whereas it did not affect the stability of L. chinensis. These results deepen our understanding of the regulatory role played by community structure and species diversity regarding productivity stability in semiarid steppes.

 The process of crop type mapping generates land use maps, which serve as critical tools for efficient evaluation of production factors and impacts of agricultural practice. Yet, despite the necessity for comprehensive solutions in space and time, the state of research still exhibits significant limitations in these two dimensions: (1) From a temporal perspective, the primary focus of past research in crop type mapping has been on the economically most meaningful, main-season crops, thereby largely neglecting the explicit study of off-season vegetation despite its pivotal roles in year-round management cycles. (2) Viewed spatially, study areas in crop type mapping show distinct limitations from a multi- and transnational standpoint, despite intense cross-regional and international interrelations of agricultural production and an increasing number of countries publishing crop reference data. With a focus on Europe, this research aims to tackle the two described shortcomings (a) by investigating to what extent a selection of major off-season, winter vegetation types in continental Europe can be classified and (b) by analyzing the transnational applicability of the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT) for remote sensing-based crop type mapping across the European Union (EU). This study uses ESA’s Sentinel-2 satellite data, EU’s administrative farming declarations, and HCAT labels to analyze off-season farming measures, based on a study period from late summer to spring, in Austria, France, Germany, and Slovenia. We demonstrate that deep learning models effectively identify major productive and agroecogically significant winter vegetation in continental Europe. HCAT proves thereby valuable for transnational crop classification, excelling in mixed-country experiments and showing potential for transfer learning. This study’s findings provide a solid foundation for advancing transnational as well as winter and all-year crop type mapping, thereby serving as contribution towards temporally and spatially holistic research on agricultural practices’ sociocultural, economic, and environmental impacts."

 The coal chemical industry produces a large amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the emission characteristics and associated impact on the environment and health of the residents are still unclear. This study determined the VOC concentrations and compositions in the Jinjie Coal Chemical Industry Park which is located in northern China. The average concentrations of total measured VOCs (TVOCs) in the industrial areas in summer and winter were 231.5 and 103.2 μg/m3, which were higher than those in the residential areas (123.7 and 70.3 μg/m3), respectively. Aromatics, Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), and alkanes were the dominant VOC classes in the industrial areas, while halocarbons, OVOCs, and alkenes had higher compositions in the residential areas where were not only affected by industrial emissions and also other anthropogenic sources. OVOCs contributed over 43% of ozone formation potential (OFP), while aromatics contributed over 61% of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in the Park in both seasons. Using the source apportionment method, biogenic emission and anthropogenic source (gasoline production, coking emission, fuel combustion, solvent coating, and vehicle exhaust) were major contributors to VOCs in residential areas. The industrial-related emissions were the main components of anthropogenic source, accounting for 53.5%–58.7% of the overall VOCs. With reliable estimations of the health aspects, exposures to acrolein (HQ: 7.4–126.6) and formaldehyde (ILCR: 5.5 × 10−3-5.7 × 10−2) posed the highest non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, accounting for 94.3%–98.6% and 55.8%–93.8% of the total HQ and ILCR, respectively. The results demonstrated that substantial environmental and health co-benefits to the residents could be achieved by reducing the industrial emissions from gasoline production, coking process, and diesel-fueled vehicles in the Jinjie Coal Chemical Industry Park.

 The study explores Hurricane Michael's impact on Hurricane Leslie's trajectory predictability using ECMWF and NCEP ensemble systems. A clustering method focused on tropical cyclones is used to identify potential paths for Leslie: Cluster 1 accurately predicted Leslie's direction towards the Iberian Peninsula, whereas Clusters 2 and 3 indicated a southern recurve near the Canary Islands. Analysis of potential vorticity and irrotational wind at upper levels showed a significant interaction between Michael, ridge, and trough across the jet stream from +12 h after initialization. Cluster 1 showed a stronger Michael promoting upper-level wind divergence greatest, modifying the jet stream configuration around the ridge and downstream. Alterations in the jet stream's configuration, functioning as a waveguide, propagated downstream, guiding Leslie towards the Iberian Peninsula. Clusters 2 and 3 indicated the trough's failure to incorporate Leslie, resulting in a recurve of the trajectory around the Azores anticyclone. This research enhances comprehension of the interaction between two tropical cyclones via synoptic Rossby wave flow. Moreover, the conceptual framework can aid operational meteorologists in identifying the sources of uncertainty, particularly in track forecasts under synoptic conditions analogous to those examined in this study."

 This study addresses snow depth overestimation and temperature underestimation in the WRF/Noah-MP regional climate model by producing eight sensitivity simulations at a 10 km grid spacing for the 2001–2006 period, driven by the ERA5 reanalysis. The experiments differ either in the parameterization of snow-related processes within the Noah-MP land surface model, the physical parameterization schemes of the atmospheric model (planetary boundary layer, surface layer, microphysics), or the WRF model version (v4.2 or v4.3, with the latter incorporating snow-related code enhancements). The best-performing configuration is further tested by conducting a hindcast simulation spanning an extended climatological period (1985–2010). The study area includes parts of Western, Central, and Eastern Europe, focusing on the Carpathian Basin. Snow depth is evaluated using in situ observations from low-elevation stations and ERA5 reanalysis data. Temperature and precipitation biases are assessed using the CARPATCLIM dataset, consisting of gridded surface meteorological observations. With the appropriate choice of physical parameterizations in the WRF/Noah-MP model, the median snow depth bias is reduced from 3.4 cm/day to 0.7 cm/day across all stations during the 2001–2006 period (November to March), with a corresponding decrease in RMSE from 8.4 to 3.9 cm/day and an increase in the correlation coefficient from 0.68 to 0.82. Concurrently, the underestimation of average daily minimum temperatures decreases from 2.5 °C to 1.6 °C over a plain subregion within the Carpathian Basin. Further efforts are required to eliminate the cold bias above snow cover in the WRF/Noah-MP model. The results suggest that exploring sensitivities to physical processes within the land surface scheme is equally important as testing different physical parameterizations in the atmospheric model itself."

 The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration(BTH) has successively witnessed the extraordinary precipitation extremes (PEs) with huge economic losses and death-toll in the recent decade. To timely and comprehensively understand the PEs in the urban agglomeration, we investigate the characteristic and mechanism of PEs variation based on six extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) including maximum daily precipitation(Rx1day), maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation(Rx5day), total precipitation with daily precipitation more than the 95th percentile (R95P), average daily precipitation on wet days (SDII), heavy precipitation days(R25) and very heavy precipitation days(R50). Our results suggest that the PEs of summertime over the BTH has significantly amplified since 21st century. During 2001–2023, the Rx1day, Rx5day, R95p, SDII, R25 and R50 significantly increased at a rate of 13.5 mm/10a, 26.3 mm/10a, 49.4 mm/10a, 2.2 mm/10a, 0.78d/10a and 0.46d/10a, respectively. The average contribution of urbanization to the increased EPIs is estimated by 21 %. The strengthened East Asian Summer Monsoon, intensified and northward extended West Pacific Subtropical High may increase occurrence and severity of PEs in the era of rapid global warming. Three case studies of PEs in 2012, 2016 and 2023 verify our finding. We hope this study can help policy makers to shape strategies to mitigate or reduce societal impact of PEs under global warming crisis and rapid urbanization."

Here, we report a large number of submicroscopic magnetite particles embedded within iron-sulfide on the surface of Chang’e-5 glass, with a close positive correlation between magnetite content and the TiO2content of the surrounding glass.

Magnetite in lunar glass is a potential candidate for the “magnetite-like” phase detected in the Apollo era and suggests that impact-induced submicroscopic magnetite may be ubiquitous in high-Ti regions of the Moon.

This reconstruction aligns with independent hydroclimate and δ18O records withheld from the DA, revealing a centennial-scale SASM intensification during the MCA-LIA transition period, associated with the southward shift of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone and the strengthening Pacific Walker circulation (PWC).

Here, we use climate model simulations and proxy-based reconstructions of ocean temperature changes to show that an increased deglacial HSE is achieved by warming of intermediate-depth waters forced by mid-latitude surface warming in response to greenhouse gas and ice sheet forcing as well as by reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation associated with meltwater forcing.

A potential avenue for achieving correlated flat bands involves leveraging geometrical constraints within specific lattice structures, such as the kagome lattice; however, materials are often more complex. In these cases, quantum geometry becomes a powerful indicator of the nature of bands with small dispersions.

Here, we focused on glutaminolysis and genetically blocked this process through glutaminase (GLS) deletion in SCC cells of origin. Genetic deletion of GLS had little effect on tumorigenesis due to the up-regulated lactate consumption and utilization for the TCA cycle, providing further evidence of metabolic flexibility. We went on to show that posttranscriptional regulation of nutrient transporters appears to mediate metabolic flexibility in this SCC model.

The transmembrane emp24 domain 9 (TMED9) cargo receptor promotes a general mechanism of cytotoxicity by entrapping misfolded protein cargos in the early secretory pathway. However, the molecular basis for this TMED9-mediated cargo retention remains elusive. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of TMED9, which reveal its unexpected self-oligomerization into octamers, dodecamers, and, by extension, even higher-order oligomers. The TMED9 oligomerization is driven by an intrinsic symmetry mismatch between the trimeric coiled coil domain and the tetrameric transmembrane domain. Using frameshifted Mucin 1 as an example of aggregated disease-related protein cargo, we implicate a mode of direct interaction with the TMED9 luminal Golgi-dynamics domain.

Several studies indicated that selenium deficiency is associated with sarcopenia; however, the specific mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that selenoprotein W (SELENOW) containing selenium in the form of selenocysteine functioned in sarcopenia. SELENOW expression is up-regulated in dexamethasone (DEX)–induced muscle atrophy and age-related sarcopenia mouse models. Knockout (KO) of SELENOW profoundly aggravated the process of muscle mass loss in the two mouse models. Mechanistically,SELENOWKO suppressed the RAC1-mTOR cascade by the interaction between SELENOW and RAC1 and induced the imbalance of protein synthesis and degradation. Consistently, overexpression of SELENOW in vivo and in vitro alleviated the muscle and myotube atrophy induced by DEX. SELENOW played a role in age-related sarcopenia and regulated the genes associated with aging. Together, our study uncovered the function of SELENOW in age-related sarcopenia and provides promising evidence for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia."

These results are corroborated by (i) engineered disruptions in the predictive assemblies, which modulate immunotherapy response in mice, and (ii) histochemistry showing that predicted responders have elevated inflammation.

In this review, we discuss insights gained from retina studies into the versatile roles of short-term synaptic plasticity in context-dependent circuit functions. Plasticity at single synapse level greatly expands the algorithms of common microcircuit motifs and contributes to diverse circuit-level behaviors such as gain modulation, selective gating, and stimulus-dependent excitatory/inhibitory balance.

 A new dataset from oceanographic cruises in the Western Mediterranean Sea (WMED) was compiled to integrate the previously published regional data product about dissolved inorganic nutrients CNR-DIN-WMED about dissolved inorganic nutrients (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.904172, Belgacem et al., 2019, 2020). The Mediterranean region is experiencing rapid changes, necessitating high-quality and reliable datasets. However, the scarcity of the in-situ observations hinders the understanding of these changes and their impact on biogeochemical cycles. Dissolved oxygen is a vital component of marine ecosystems and plays a fundamental role in governing nutrient and carbon cycles, underscoring the need for accurate and reliable data. To address this, a high resolution, regional-scale data product was developed to understand decadal variability and spatial/temporal patterns of the ventilation process in the WMED.

This study investigated the long-term effects of continuous cattle grazing, stocking rates, and fertilization regimens on methane (CH4) emissions, soil microbial communities, and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in Bermudagrass pastures in East Texas, USA. Pastures were subjected to high or low stocking rates for over 50 years, with further subdivision based on fertilization: nitrogen-based fertilizer application or no fertilizer but with the growth of annual clover. Seasonal soil cores (0–60 cm) were collected, and laboratory microcosm incubation studies revealed unexpectedly high in vitro CH4 emissions in surface soils, particularly in the top 0–5 cm soil layer, reaching up to 300 nmol of CH4 mL–1. Higher CH4 emissions and methanogen abundance, along with lower SOC stocks, were observed in pastures subjected to high stocking rates compared to those with low stocking rates and in clover pastures compared to those with N-fertilized ryegrass. On the contrary, in low-stocked, N-fertilized annual ryegrass pastures, methanogen abundance was lowest, CH4 emissions were negligible, and SOC stocks were highest. Furthermore, animal excreta deposition significantly contributed to increased CH4 emissions. Prokaryotic and potential methanotrophic taxa, as compared to fungi, exhibited greater responsiveness to N-fertilization than to cattle stocking treatments with higher levels of methanotrophs observed in pastures subjected to high stocking rates and clover growth. This study suggests that strategic management practices such as optimal grazing and nitrogen management could effectively mitigate CH4 emissions in grazing lands."

The ENSO evolution can be overall reproduced without the NPO forcing, confirming the predominant intrinsic predictability arising from the tropical coupled dynamics. However, the extratropical atmospheric forcing associated with the NPO, when it reaches three standard deviations, can enhance the ENSO development by about 29.6%, contrasting with limited effects of the moderate NPO forcing.

One circulation mode has a distinct warm anomaly at 300 hPa covering most areas of North China, together with the boundary‐layer westerly anomaly occurring in North China and its southern region (UTWA‐BLWA). UTWA‐BLWA effectively contributes to the reinforcement of the upper‐level divergence and the low‐level moisture convergence by promoting the strengthening of upper anticyclonic and low‐level southwesterly anomalies. The combined effects of low‐level jet (LLJ) and topographic uplift form the central‐northern STHR pattern. The other circulation structure has a 300‐hPa warm anomaly located to the southeastern Russia and a prominent 300‐hPa cold anomaly covering the south, together with the boundary‐layer easterly anomaly occurring over the whole region of eastern China (UTCA‐BLEA). The southern STHR pattern is attributed to the exit of the boundary‐layer jet (BLJ) over lower elevations due to moist transport and dynamic uplift associated with the easterly anomaly. The results indicate that the locations of STHR are related to the direction, intensity, and height of the LLJ. The findings highlight that the upper‐tropospheric temperature anomalies (UTTA) and boundary‐layer easterly flow jointly modulate heavy rainfall.

Significantly, the additional O species from CO2 and the carbon species from hydrocarbons can react to form CO, maintaining the high catalytic activity of the electrified heating wire.

 Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are pivotal in scientific research and engineering because they provide essential topographic and geomorphological information. Voids in DEM data result in the loss of terrain information, significantly impacting its broad applicability. Although spatial interpolation methods are frequently employed to address these voids, they suffer from accuracy degradation and struggle to reconstruct intricate terrain features. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approaches have emerged as promising solutions to enhance elevation accuracy and facilitate the reconstruction of partial terrain features. Nonetheless, GAN-based methods exhibit limitations with specific void shapes, and their performance is susceptible to artifacts and elevation jumps around the void boundaries. To address shortcomings mentioned above, we propose a terrain feature-guided diffusion model (TFDM) to fill the DEM data voids. The training and inference processes of the diffusion model were constrained by terrain feature lines to ensure the stability of the generated DEM surface. The TFDM is distinguished by its ability to generate seamless DEM surfaces and maintain stable terrain contours in response to varying terrain conditions. Experiments were conducted to validate the applicability of TFDM using different DEMs, including Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Models (ASTER GDEMv3) and the TanDEM-X global DEM. The proposed TFDM algorithm and comparison methods such as DDPM, GAN, and Kriging were applied to a full test set of 271 DEM images covering different terrain environments. The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the DEM restored by TFDM were 28.91 ± 9.45 m and 38.16 ± 13.00 m, respectively, while the MAE and RMSE of the comparison algorithms were no less than 60.87 ± 26.24 m and 82.80 ± 36.51 m or even higher, validating the effectiveness of the TFDM algorithm in filling DEM voids. Profile analysis in partial details indicates that the TFDM outperforms alternative methods in reconstructing terrain features, as confirmed through visual inspection and quantitative comparison. TFDM exhibits versatility when applied to DEM data with diverse resolutions and produced using various measurement techniques."

 The grounding line marks the transition between a glacier's floating and grounded parts and serves as a crucial parameter for monitoring sea level changes and assessing glacier retreat. The Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique for grounding line mapping currently requires the involvement of human experts, which becomes challenging with the continuously growing volume of grounding line data available for every Antarctic glacier. While a deep learning approach has been recently proposed for mapping grounding lines over C-band Sentinel-1 DInSAR data, its effectiveness has not been assessed over X-Band COSMO-SkyMed DInSAR data. Similarly, the applicability of an analytical algorithm developed for X-band TerraSAR-X DInSAR data has not been evaluated over a large diverse dataset. Here we apply both techniques to map grounding lines over a large X-band COSMO-SkyMed DInSAR dataset from 2020 to 2022, covering Stancomb-Wills, Veststraumen, Jutulstraumen, Moscow University, and Rennick Antarctic glaciers. We determine strengths and limitations of each algorithm, compare their performance with manual mapping and provide recommendations for choosing appropriate data processing methods for effective grounding line mapping. We also note that since 1996, Moscow University glacier's main trunk was retreating at a rate of 340 ± 80 m/year, while the other four glaciers experienced no retreat. Considering the grounding zone widths, which represent the difference between the high and low tide grounding line positions during a tidal cycle, we detect a grounding zone of 9.7 km over Veststraumen Glacier, which is almost six times larger than the average grounding zone of the other four glaciers."

 Spectral reconstruction technology extracts rich detail information from limited spectral bands, thereby enhancing both of the image quality and the resolution capabilities. It finds application in non-destructive testing, elevating the precision and robustness of detection. Current studies primarily focus on improving the local information perception of convolutional neural networks or modeling long-distance dependencies with Transformer. However, such approaches fail to effectively integrate global–local modeling information, resulting in poor accuracy in image reconstruction. This paper introduces a Progressive CNN-Transformer Alternating Reconstruction Network (PCTARN) to alternately utilize robust convolutional attention and transpose Transformer self-attention. A Dual-Path CNN-Transformer Alternating Reconstruction Module (DPCTARM) is proposed to dynamically introduce global–local dynamic priors at various levels to facilitate extracting high- and low-frequency features. This enhancement effectively strengthens PCTARN’s capability to discern valuable signals. To verify the proposed method, a spectral dataset based on seven selected red tide algae is collected. And a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metric of 34.58 dB is achieved, which is at least 0.44 dB higher than the methods such as MAUN and MST++. While the Params and FLOPS are reduced by over 41.9 % and 38.4 %, respectively. Since the performance of the proposed PCTARN depends not only on image quality but also on spectral fidelity, an application of spectral detection on red tide are conducted for this purpose. Four feature bands are selected from multispectral images and reconstructed into 20-band hyperspectral images by using PCTARN. Species identification and cell concentration detection are conducted based on the reconstructed images. The results demonstrate that PCTARN can enhance the spatial signal and spectral peak differences of red tide samples, achieving an identification accuracy of 94.21 % and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9660 in species identification and cell concentration detection, which are respectively improved by 11.55 % and 11.59 % compared to those of 4-band multispectral detection."

 This study analyzes the performance of the Climate–Weather Research and Forecasting (CWRF) model in predicting the summer temperature and precipitation in northwestern China (NWC) for the 1991–2021 period. It also examines the improvements in prediction resulting from the implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) downscaling methods. The results indicate that the CWRF model demonstrates reasonable ability in capturing the characteristics of climatological temperature and precipitation in NWC. Both the climatological temperature and precipitation predictions consistently demonstrate a systematic underestimation, revealing evident biases in regions characterized by complex terrain. In terms of interannual variation, the temperature prediction outperforms the precipitation prediction, whereas there is no significant difference in the temperature predictions for lead Months 1–3. However, uncertainties increase as the lead time is extended in precipitation prediction. Therefore, the combination of dynamical and statistical downscaling is employed to the summer temperature and precipitation prediction over NWC. It is shown both the CNN and LSTM downscaling methods can improve the prediction ability of the CWRF model for summer climatological temperature and precipitation. The LSTM method significantly reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of precipitation and temperature predictions, indicating an improvement in predicting the spatial structure. At the interannual scale, the CNN method is less dependent on the lead time of prediction than the LSTM method is, and the interannual correlation coefficient of precipitation and temperature is greater than 0.1 compared with that of the raw CWRF model. These results provide valuable insights into understanding the prediction capabilities of the CWRF model in NWC and highlight the necessity of applying downscaling methods to the CWRF model to increase its prediction ability."

However, it is still challenging to construct high-efficiency and antifouling air filtration membranes with recyclable regeneration. Herein, the fluorine-free amphiphobic micro/nanofiber composite membrane was controllably constructed by integrating click chemistry reaction and electrospinning technique. Low-surface-energy fibers were constructed by a thiol–ene click chemical reaction between mercaptosilane and vinyl groups of polystyrene–butadiene-styrene (SBS), combined with hydroxyl-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) during the electrospinning process. The functional air filter is then prepared by the two-layer composite strategy. Because of the advantages of liquid-like fibrous surface and micro/nanofibrous porous structure, SBS/PAN composite membrane simultaneously shows superior antifouling performances of pollutants and filtration efficiency of over 97% PM0.3 removal. More importantly, the antifouling fibrous membrane still presents a stable and efficient filtration efficiency after multiple washes. Its service life in dust filtration environments is approximately 1.7 times longer than that of the substrate membrane. This work may provide a significant reference for the design of antifouling fiber membranes and high-efficiency air filters with long life spans and reusability."

However, the toxicity mechanisms of SCCPs to the male reproductive system remain unclear. In this study, male BALB/c  mice and GC-1 cells were used to investigate the reproductive toxicity of SCCPs and their molecular mechanisms. SCCPs decreased the content of the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate α-KG in testicular cells, thus inhibiting the activity of the DNA demethylase TET enzyme and resulting in an increase in the overall methylation level of the testicular genome. Correspondingly, the promoter demethylation and expression of spermatogenesis-related genes Rbm46, Sohlh1, Kit, and Dmrt1 were significantly reduced by SCCPs, which further prevented the transformation of spermatogonia to spermatocytes and reduced sperm quality in mice. The in vitro experiments suggested that the TGFβ pathway activated by oxidative stress might be an essential reason for inhibiting the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the reduction of α-KG content in testicular cells induced by SCCPs. Overall, this study reveals a novel metabolic regulatory mechanism of SCCPs-induced spermatogenesis disorders, which provides an essential theoretical basis for the prevention of reproductive toxicity of SCCPs."

Evidence for upstream propagating whistler waves supported by two‐stream instability is continuously growing, see for example, recent surveys based on MMS in‐situ observations of the Earth bow‐shock.

Here, we obtain a crust model of NE Tibet by jointly inverting Rayleigh wave ellipticity and phase velocity. Our results reveal that deep crustal strength contrasts across NE Tibet play an important role in controlling basin development. Extrusion of the significantly weak Qilian crust is obstructed by rigid Alxa block, resulting in deep foreland basin with dramatic topographic step. In contrast, the relatively weak crust of Longzhong absorbs outward extrusion of NE Tibet within a wide transition zone, leading to small intermontane basins. Furthermore, the systematic thinning of basins from north to south around the western Ordos Block demonstrates the tectonic transformation from extension to compression due to expansion of NE Tibet since the late Miocene."

The consistent deposition pattern caused by the numerical turbidity currents with different input parameters indicate that morphology of the canyon may exert a dominant influence on turbidite deposition. This is attributed to a significant reduction in shear velocity as simulated turbidity currents flowing through the scours on the canyon floor.

However, the systematic bias of the global climate model (GCM) generally degrades the reliability of projections. Recently, novel bias‐corrected CMIP6 data was generated using a mean‐variance‐trend (MVT) bias correction method for dynamical downscaling simulation. To validate the effectiveness of this data in the dynamical downscaling simulation of climate extremes, we carry out three Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations over Asia‐western North Pacific with a 25 km grid spacing from 1980 to 2014. The dynamical downscaling simulations driven by the raw GCM data set (hereafter WRF_GCM) and the bias‐corrected GCM (hereafter WRF_GCMbc) were assessed against the simulation driven by the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 data set. The results indicate that the MVT bias correction significantly improves the climatological mean and inter‐annual variability of downscaled climate extreme indices. In terms of the climatological mean, the WRF_GCMbc shows a 25%–82% decrease in root mean square errors (RMSEs) against the WRF_GCM. As for the inter‐annual variability, the MVT bias correction can improve the downscaling simulation of almost all precipitation extreme indices and 70% of the temperature extreme indices, characterized by the RMSEs' reduction of 1%–58%. The improvements of the climate extremes in terms of the climatological mean in the WRF_GCMbc primarily stem from the improved large‐scale circulation and ocean evaporation in the WRF, which in turn improves the downscaled precipitation and 2 m temperature through the advection, radiation, and surface energy exchange process."

The probability of a transition from one type of event to another is influenced by multiple factors of which many are projected to change. Here we assess the likelihood of ENSO transitions in observations and climate models, including a distinction between events that peak in the Eastern Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP). We find that the initial ENSO state influences the likelihood of certain transitions and that some transitions are not physically possible or stochastically likely. For example, transitions to CP events are more likely than EP events except from a neutral state. We also find that El Niños tend to occur as singular events compared to La Niñas. While consecutive El Niño and La Niña events of EP type are possible, opposing EP events do not occur in succession. We identify several transitions likely driven by internal dynamical processes including neutral conditions to El Niño, CP El Niño to another El Niño, EP El Niño to CP La Niña, CP La Niña to CP El Niño and La Niña, and EP La Niña to neutral and CP El Niño. Projections of future transitions show an increased probability of transitions to CP El Niño events while transitions to EP La Niña events become less frequent under a high-emissions scenario. Accordingly, transitions to these events become more and less likely, respectively. We also find changes in the likelihood of specific transitions in a warming world: consecutive CP El Niño events become more likely while EP El Niño events become less likely to transition into CP La Niña events. These changes are expected to occur as early as 2050 with some changes to be accelerated by the end of the 21st century."

 Effective monitoring of global water resources is increasingly critical due to climate change and population growth. Advancements in remote sensing technology, specifically in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, are revolutionizing water resource monitoring, leading to more frequent and high-quality surface water extent maps using various techniques such as traditional image processing and machine learning algorithms. However, satellite imagery datasets contain trade-offs that result in inconsistencies in performance, such as disparities in measurement principles between optical (e.g., Sentinel-2) and radar (e.g., Sentinel-1) sensors and differences in spatial and spectral resolutions among optical sensors. Therefore, developing accurate and robust surface water mapping solutions requires independent validations from multiple datasets to identify potential biases within the imagery and algorithms. However, high-quality validation datasets are expensive to build, and few contain information on water resources. For this purpose, we introduce a globally sampled, high-spatial-resolution dataset labeled using 3 m PlanetScope imagery (Planet Team, 2017). Our surface water extent dataset comprises 100 images, each with a size of 1024×1024 pixels, which were sampled using a stratified random sampling strategy covering all 14 biomes.

Great efforts have been made to build SOCS database at regional, national and even sub-continental scales following LULCC; however, a comprehensive and open-access global database has not yet been developed, hindering a deep understanding of LULCC impact on SOCS dynamics. In this study, we introduce a new global SOCS database for LULCC, compiled from 639 articles documented in the Web of Science through the end of 2023. Targeting five major land uses (cropland, grasslands, forest, plantation, and savanna), this database – named the Global Soil Organic Carbon Stock dataset after Land Use and Land Cover Change (GSOCS-LULCC) – include 1,206 sites with 5,982 records at various sampling depths. The database will enable users to assess the global impact of LULCC on SOCS dynamics and identify the factors that control SOCS changes for specific types of LULCC. The GSOCS-LULCC database is freely available from the Zenodo platform at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11183819 (Chen et al., 2024)."
10.1029/2024AV001197,False,AGU Advances,这篇论文主要研究了磁鞘高速流（HSJ）对地球极光的影响。研究发现，当磁鞘中出现高速流时，在地球午区附近会观测到多个平行于极光带的极光弧。这些极光弧的电子能量谱图呈现“倒V”结构，表明存在准静态平行电场。同时，在地面上也探测到长周期ULF信号，表明阿尔文波的到达。研究利用真实的观测数据进行了动力学模拟，结果表明，长周期阿尔文波可以产生“倒V”结构，与理论相符。这项研究建立了HSJ、ULF波和极光之间以前未建立的联系，并提供了一种在午区附近产生离散极光弧的机制。,"['magnetosheath', 'high-speed jet', 'auroral arcs', 'ULF waves', 'Alfvén waves', 'electron energy spectrogram', 'inverted-V structures', 'kinetic simulation']",Hui‐Xuan Qiu;De‐Sheng Han;Run Shi;Jianjun Liu,Magnetosheath High‐Speed Jet Drives Multiple Auroral Arcs Near Local Noon,"Magnetosheath High‐Speed Jets (HSJs) are transient disturbances characterized by increased dynamic pressure. They can cause various geoeffects, including ultra‐low‐frequency (ULF) waves and auroras. Theoretically, when ULF waves propagate into the ionosphere as Alfvén waves, they can accelerate electrons and generate discrete auroras. However, what types of aurora can be driven by HSJs and what are the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using coordinated magnetosheath in situ and ground observations, here, we showed that when a HSJ was identified in the magnetosheath, multiple auroral arcs parallel to the auroral oval were observed near local noon. The electron energy spectrogram of these arcs exhibited “inverted‐V” structures, indicating the existence of quasi‐static parallel electric fields. Concurrently, long‐period ULF signals were detected on the ground, suggesting the arrival of Alfvén waves. These observations are represented by a kinetic simulation using realistic observational inputs, showing consistency with the theory regarding the generation of the “inverted‐V” structure by long‐period Alfvén waves. This study builds a previously unestablished connection among HSJ, ULF wave, and aurora, and provides a mechanism for generation of discrete auroral arcs near local noon, which may reveal the underlying mechanism behind a specific auroral activity commonly observed near local noon as shown in the paper."

Roberts,The Relative Role of Indian and Pacific Tropical Heating as Seasonal Predictability Drivers for the North Atlantic Oscillation,"Understanding the predictability drivers for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during boreal winter at seasonal time scales remains challenging. This study uses large ensembles with the ECMWF seasonal forecasting system to investigate the relative impact of tropical Indian and Pacific heating on NAO predictability by examining the tropical forcing, teleconnection pathways, and sources of uncertainty. We select three case studies ‐ 1997/98, 2015/16 and 2019/20 ‐ with strong Indian Ocean heating anomalies, but with different El Niño conditions. We show that in 2019/20, with neutral ENSO conditions, Indian Ocean SSTs favor a positive NAO response via stratospheric and tropospheric pathways. In the cases with strong El Niño, we find contrasting results: in 1997/98, the Pacific forcing dominates, producing a negative NAO. In 2015/16, despite the strong El Niño, the Indian Ocean forcing dominates, leading to a positive NAO via intensification of the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV). While the stratospheric pathway exhibits varying responses to Indian Ocean forcing ‐ being weaker in 1997/98 and strongest in 2015/16, the Indian Ocean‐related tropospheric pathway remains robust along the Pacific subtropical jet across years. However, there is destructive interference between teleconnections from Indian and Pacific SST anomalies in both the tropospheric and stratospheric pathways. The competing effects of tropical heating in both basins, uncertainties in the Rossby wave response to tropical heating and SPV variability contribute to uncertainty in seasonal NAO predictions. The flow‐dependent nature of the stratospheric pathway underscores the complexity of seasonal forecast predictability, and the existence of windows of opportunity."

 Crop translational genomics applies breeding techniques based on genomic datasets to improve crops. Technological breakthroughs in the past ten years have made it possible to sequence the genomes of increasing numbers of crop varieties and have assisted in the genetic dissection of crop performance. However, translating research findings to breeding applications remains challenging. Here we review recent progress and future prospects for crop translational genomics in bringing results from the laboratory to the field. Genetic mapping, genomic selection and sequence-assisted characterization and deployment of plant genetic resources utilize rapid genotyping of large populations. These approaches have all had an impact on breeding for qualitative traits, where single genes with large phenotypic effects exert their influence. Characterization of the complex genetic architectures that underlie quantitative traits such as yield and flowering time, especially in newly domesticated crops, will require further basic research, including research into regulation and interactions of genes and the integration of genomic approaches and high-throughput phenotyping, before targeted interventions can be designed. Future priorities for translation include supporting genomics-assisted breeding in low-income countries and adaptation of crops to changing environments.

 Cryogenic electron tomography is a technique for imaging biological samples in 3D. A microscope collects a series of 2D projections of the sample, and the goal is to reconstruct the 3D density of the sample called the tomogram. Reconstruction is difficult as the 2D projections are noisy and can not be recorded from all directions, resulting in a missing wedge of information. Tomograms conventionally reconstructed with filtered back-projection suffer from noise and strong artefacts due to the missing wedge. Here, we propose a deep-learning approach for simultaneous denoising and missing wedge reconstruction called DeepDeWedge. The algorithm requires no ground truth data and is based on fitting a neural network to the 2D projections using a self-supervised loss. DeepDeWedge is simpler than current state-of-the-art approaches for denoising and missing wedge reconstruction, performs competitively and produces more denoised tomograms with higher overall contrast.

 In Bangladesh, Vibrio cholerae lineages are undergoing genomic evolution, with increased virulence and spreading ability. However, our understanding of the genomic determinants influencing lineage transmission and disease severity remains incomplete. Here, we developed a computational framework using machine-learning, genome scale metabolic modelling (GSSM) and 3D structural analysis, to identify V. cholerae genomic traits linked to lineage transmission and disease severity. We analysed in-patients isolates from six Bangladeshi regions (2015-2021), and uncovered accessory genes and core SNPs unique to the most recent dominant lineage, with virulence, motility and bacteriophage resistance functions. We also found a strong correlation between V. cholerae genomic traits and disease severity, with some traits overlapping those driving lineage transmission. GSMM and 3D structure analysis unveiled a complex interplay between transcription regulation, protein interaction and stability, and metabolic networks, associated to lifestyle adaptation, intestinal colonization, acid tolerance and symptom severity.

 H2O transforms to two forms of superionic (SI) ice at high pressures and temperatures, which contain highly mobile protons within a solid oxygen sublattice. Yet the stability field of both phases remains debated. Here, we present the results of an ultrafast X-ray heating study utilizing MHz pulse trains produced by the European X-ray Free Electron Laser to create high temperature states of H2O, which were probed using X-ray diffraction during dynamic cooling. We confirm an isostructural transition during heating in the 26-69 GPa range, consistent with the formation of SI-bcc. In contrast to prior work, SI-fcc was observed exclusively above ~50 GPa, despite evidence of melting at lower pressures. The absence of SI-fcc in lower pressure runs is attributed to short heating timescales and the pressure-temperature path induced by the pump-probe heating scheme in which H2O was heated above its melting temperature before the observation of quenched crystalline states, based on the earlier theoretical prediction that SI-bcc nucleates more readily from the fluid than SI-fcc. Our results may have implications for the stability of SI phases in ice-rich planets, for example during dynamic freezing, where the preferential crystallization of SI-bcc may result in distinct physical properties across mantle ice layers. The authors perform heating experiments using femtosecond X-ray free electron laser pulses to explore the phase stability of superionic H2O.

 Cytotherapy is a strategy to deliver modified cells to a diseased tissue, but targeting solid tumours remains challenging. Here we design macrophages, harbouring a surface glypican-3-targeting peptide and carrying a cargo to combat solid tumours. The anchored targeting peptide facilitates tumour cell recognition by the engineered macrophages, thus enhancing specific targeting and phagocytosis of tumour cells expressing glypican-3. These macrophages carry a cargo of the TLR7/TLR8 agonist R848 and INCB024360, a selective indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor, wrapped in C16-ceramide-fused outer membrane vesicles (OMV) of Escherichia coli origin (RILO). The OMVs facilitate internalization through caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and to maintain a suitable nanostructure, C16-ceramide induces membrane invagination and exosome generation, leading to the release of cargo-packed RILOs through exosomes. RILO-loaded macrophages exert therapeutic efficacy in mice bearing H22 hepatocellular carcinomas, which express high levels of glypican-3. Overall, we lay down the proof of principle for a cytotherapeutic strategy to target solid tumours and could complement conventional treatment.

Here we show a FeCl3 cathode that costs as little as 1% of the cost of a LiCoO2 cathode or 2% of a LiFePO4 cathode. Once coupled with a solid halide electrolyte and a lithium-indium (Li–In) alloy anode, it enables all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries without any liquid components. Notably, FeCl3 exhibits two flat voltage plateaux between 3.5 and 3.8 V versus Li+/Li, and the solid cell retains 83% of its initial capacity after 1,000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.95%.

 On June 25, 2020, an atypical bow echo (ATBE) accompanied by a meso-γ-scale vortex (MV) incurred the strongest gust (41.4 m s−1) recorded since 1957 in the North China Plain. In this article, we investigate the evolution characteristics of MV and its mechanism for the extreme wind by using the observation data of Doppler weather radar and automatic weather stations as well as the four-dimensional Variational Doppler Radar Analysis System (VDRAS). The results show that the MV in this process was initially born at a height of 0.9–2.4 km, and the contracting and stretching vertical vortex rapidly descended to surface from the 2.0 km height with the rotation speed increasing rapidly. Six minutes later, the extreme wind occurred. The generation mechanism of the MV is that, under the strong vertical wind shear and downdraft in the lower troposphere, the vertical vortex tube of MV was transformed from the horizontal vortex tube generated in the zone of perturbation temperature gradient. The influence mechanism of MV on the extreme wind is that, as the MV continued to intensify and extend downward, a negative perturbation low-pressure center formed in the lower troposphere near the MV. Meanwhile, the descending rear-inflow jet (RIJ) was blocked by the prefrontal upward motion and a positive perturbation high-pressure center formed at around 1 km height. The violent positive-negative couplets of perturbation pressure gradient produced a downward nonhydrostatic perturbation pressure gradient force (NPPGF) that further intensified the vertical downward velocity. In addition to the strong downdraft velocity, the Coriolis force also enhanced the formation of the extreme wind through the action of ageostrophic winds. Besides, this paper also compares the mechanism of this process with that of a typical bow echo MV and the extreme wind it affected."

 On 7–8 August 2017, a rare nocturnal overshooting convection (OC) and torrential precipitation event occurred in the Sichuan Basin (SCB) of Southwest China. This event was mainly caused by a mesoscale northerly low-level jet (MNLLJ), rather than the usual southerly low-level jet. According to the momentum budget equation, the spatiotemporal variations of the MNLLJ were primarily dominated by meridional pressure gradient force. In this study, the roles of MNLLJ on the OC from dynamic and thermodynamic perspectives were investigated using multi-source observations and a high-resolution weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. From dynamic perspectives, the MNLLJ acted as a low-level side-inflow for convective systems. Under the topographical convergence and uplift effects, the MNLLJ perpendicular to the mountain triggered low-level convections and precipitation in the Dalou Mountains. Meanwhile, the MNLLJ coupled with upper-altitude gale to furnish an auspicious condition of low/upper-level convergence/divergence for the formation of OC. From thermodynamic perspectives, the nocturnal formation of convective instability by the MNLLJ-related advection and lifting effects was a crucial factor for the local rapidly growing convective systems. In addition, the MNLLJ provided the horizontal convergence and vertical transportation of local moisture for it. The high-altitude peak of diabatic heating also contributed to the enhancement of the averaged vertical wind velocity with a maximum over 0.3 m∙s−1. Other factors affecting OC were also discussed, including mesoscale convective vortex, upper-tropospheric ageostrophic aspiration, westerly trough, and South Asian High. A conceptual framework for the formation and maintenance of OC is established."

The range of mitigation potential estimates from integrated assessment models raises concerns about the capacity of land systems to provide realistic, cost-effective and permanent land-based mitigation. We use the Global Change Analysis Model to quantify the economic mitigation potential of forests-based measures by simulating a climate policy including a tax on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. In addition, we assess how constraining unused arable land (UAL) availability, forestland expansion rates, and global bioenergy demand may influence the forests-based mitigation potential by simulating scenarios with alternative combinations of constraints. Results show that the average forests-based mitigation potential in 2020–2050 increases from 738 MtCO2.yr−1 through a forestland increase of 86 Mha in the fully constrained scenario to 1394 MtCO2.yr−1 through a forestland increase of 146 Mha when all constraints are relaxed. Regional potentials in terms of A/R and RDF differ strongly between scenarios: unconstrained forest expansion rates mostly increase A/R potentials in northern regions (e.g., +120 MtCO2.yr−1 in North America); while unconstrained UAL conversion and low bioenergy demand mostly increase RDF potentials in tropical regions (e.g., +76 and +68 MtCO2.yr−1 in Southeast Asia, respectively). This study shows that forests-based mitigation is limited by many factors that constrain the rates of land use change across regions. These factors, often overlooked in modelling exercises, should be carefully addressed for understanding the role of forests in global climate mitigation and defining pledges towards the Paris Agreement."

Understanding the variability in energy transfer within the plankton community in the contemporary climate can provide valuable insights for future projections of planktonic dynamics. Therefore, we use a regional physical-biogeochemical ocean model simulation (CROCO-BioEBUS) from 1990 to 2010 to investigate the underlying mechanisms of seasonal and interannual variability of the trophic transfer. Our model simulations suggest that, on an interannual scale, variations in trophic transfer are governed by variations in the offshore surface flow that modulate the plankton cross-shore distribution. Weak offshore surface flow, as simulated during the El Niño period, allows the zooplankton to stay relatively close to the shore, leading to more efficient grazing and trophic transfer compared to years with strong offshore flow. This mechanism differs from the seasonal one, where the mixed layer depth is the primary driver of variations in plankton dynamics, including trophic transfer. Our results highlight that mechanisms controlling plankton trophic transfer differ across time scales, and thus stress that extrapolating solely from seasonal findings to understand long-term trophic transfer changes in the context of climate change may be insufficient."

This poses a major challenge as nearly 40% of the global population lives under water scarcity, including areas such as Bangladesh, which is one of the largest, most populous and climate-vulnerable deltas (Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna: GBM) in the world. Here, we aim (first attempt) to analyse the historical dynamics (spatial and temporal) of river flows in 10 major rivers and provide policy implications using a safe operating space (SOS) concept for the Bangladesh delta. In general, the space just before the unsustainable state is defined as an SOS, within which humanity can safely thrive and beyond which is dangerous to humanity. Time series analysis highlights that all seasonal river flow shows a decreasing trend in the last three decades except in the winter season. The hydrological alteration using range of variability approach confirms that the majority of the river flow has been altered high to severely including three major rivers (Ganges, Jamuna, and Old Brahmaputra) in the Bangladesh delta. Our findings show that four out of ten rivers (Ganges (dry season), Gorai, Halda and Old Brahmaputra) exceeded the SOS, with the rest of the six rivers given cautious status considering the hydrological alteration (moderate to severe) in the Bangladesh delta.

SCG helps relay the preferences of international consumers to producers and fills environmental policy gaps. Brazil’s Zero-Deforestation Cattle Agreements (CA) are one of the longest-standing examples of SCG but shortcomings in implementation have reduced their conservation impacts. Chief among the reasons for their limited effect is that slaughterhouses monitor only the suppliers they buy from directly. This does not account for the complex supply network upstream of the direct sale, whose dynamics are also poorly understood. We provide the first comprehensive characterization of the strength and duration of cattle supply chain relationships based on animal transaction records from across the Brazilian Amazon. Whereas direct supply relationships (from ranchers to slaughterhouses) are relatively few and long-lasting, upstream relationships between ranchers are numerous and short-lived. Expanding monitoring to include these upstream sup- pliers increases the number of monitored transactions by an order of magnitude. However, 1% of the largest direct suppliers sell nearly half of cattle to CA slaughterhouses. More comprehensive upstream monitoring of only these prolific suppliers could greatly increase coverage at a fraction of the cost. While it may be challenging to monitor the entire supply network, significant advancements are within reach."

With AMI, utilities have also gained the opportunity to provide real-time high-resolution water consumption information to their customers to induce conservation. Using a randomized controlled trial we find that on average homes that install AMI and receive conservation based messaging significantly reduce water consumption by 5.24 gallons per household per day beyond savings already obtained from home water reports. Of the estimated water savings we attribute 92.8% to leak reduction. While the payback period from the deployment of AMI meters and treatment in all homes is over 41 years, homes that experience leaks realize financial savings of $60/year and a treatment payback period of four years. This is because treatment did not induce water or financial savings in homes without leaks. These findings indicate that even on top of existing conservation programs, AMI messaging that targets end-user leaks could result in significant water savings, economic benefits to end-users, and advance conservation goals."

 The Extended European Alpine Region (EEAR) exhibits a well-established and very high-density network of in-situ weather stations, hardly attainable in other mountainous regions of the world. However, the strong fragmentation into national and regional administrations and the diversity of data sources have so far hampered full exploitation of the available data for climate research.

Quantile matching was applied to adjust inhomogeneous periods in time series. Overall, about 4 % of data were flagged as non-reliable and about 20 % of air temperature time series were corrected for one or more inhomogeneous periods. In the case of precipitation time series, fewer breakpoints were detected, confirming the well-known challenge of properly identifying inhomogeneities in noisy data.

 The Marine Ice Sheet–Ocean Model Intercomparison Project – phase 2 (MISOMIP2) is a natural progression of previous and ongoing model intercomparison exercises that have focused on the simulation of ice-sheet and ocean processes in Antarctica. The previous exercises motivate the move towards realistic configurations, as well as more diverse model parameters and resolutions. The main objective of MISOMIP2 is to investigate the performance of existing ocean and coupled ice-sheet–ocean models in a range of Antarctic environments through comparisons to observational data. We will assess the status of ice-sheet–ocean modelling as a community and identify common characteristics of models that are best able to capture observed features. As models are highly tuned based on present-day data, we will also compare their sensitivity to prescribed abrupt atmospheric perturbations leading to either very warm or slightly warmer ocean conditions compared to the present day. The approach of MISOMIP2 is to welcome contributions of models as they are, including global and regional configurations, but we request standardized variables and common grids for the outputs.

 Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial flux of the hydrological water balance, commonly estimated using (semi-)empirical formulas. The estimated flux may strongly depend on the formula used, adding uncertainty to the outcomes of environmental studies using ET. Climate change may cause additional uncertainty, as the ET estimated by each formula may respond differently to changes in meteorological input data.

To assess the impact of domestic demand and international exports, we quantified the life-cycle CO2eq and ammonia (NH3) emissions by tracking carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) flows from coal/gas mining through ammonia production to N fertilizer production, application, and export. In 2020, China’s N fertilizer system emitted 496.04 Tg of CO2eq and 3.74 Tg of NH3, with ammonia production and N fertilizer application processes contributing 36 and 85% of the life-cycle CO2eq and NH3 emissions, respectively. As the largest importers of N fertilizer, India, Myanmar, South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines collectively shifted 112.41 Tg of CO2eq. For every ton of N fertilizer produced and used in China, 16 t of CO2eq and 0.18 t of NH3 were emitted, compared to 9.7 t of CO2eq and 0.13 t of NH3 in Europe. By adopting currently available technologies, improving N fertilizer utilization efficiency and employing nitrification inhibitors could synergistically reduce CO2eq emissions by 20% and NH3 emissions by 75%, while energy transformation efforts would primarily reduce CO2eq emissions by 59%. The production of ammonia using green electricity or green hydrogen could significantly enhance the decarbonization of China’s N fertilizer system."

However, owing to the significant spatiotemporal variations in water cycling driven by fluctuations in surface water, submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), and seawater, our understanding of P cycling remains inadequate. Therefore, we applied a passive sampling method using a Zr-loaded resin (Pas-Zir method) to analyze the phosphate oxygen isotope ratio (δ18OPO4) at a tidal flat dominated by SGD on Ikuchijima Island in western Japan. A Zr-loaded resin that selectively adsorbed phosphate ions was installed, and the δ18OPO4 values were monitored at the tidal flat bottom, at 5 cm above the bottom, in SGD, and in seawater for a month. The range of δ18OPO4 values at the tidal flat bottom and above the bottom (17.0‰–18.8‰) exceeded the analytical precision of the δ18OPO4 analysis (±0.4‰) and deviate from the expected isotopic equilibrium by pyrophosphatase. The results indicate that the time-integrated δ18OPO4 data can provide information on the P cycling during tidal cycles. Our study demonstrates that the Pas-Zir method is advantageous for understanding the P cycling in intertidal zones."

These estimates express biases from the stochastic nature of sediment and water discharge in controlling river incision as well as from using a mobile channel elevation as a reference frame, leading to different incision rates when calculated over different timeframes. We introduce a 1‐D model incorporating fluvial mechanics, tectonics, sediment, and climate variability to predict these biases and assess their sensitivity to climate and tectonics. Findings suggest biases intensify under highly variable climates and slow rock uplift, with climate periodicity being a primary control for our modeled scenarios.

 Influenza A viruses (IAV) have caused more documented global pandemics in human history than any other pathogen1,2. High pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses belonging to the H5N1 subtype are a leading pandemic risk. Two decades after H5N1 “bird flu” became established in poultry in Southeast Asia, its descendants have resurged3, setting off an H5N1 panzootic in wild birds that is fueled by (a) rapid intercontinental spread, reaching South America and Antarctica for the first time4,5; (b) fast evolution via genomic reassortment6; and (c) frequent spillover into terrestrial7,8 and marine mammals9. The virus has sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission in multiple settings, including European fur farms10,11, South American marine mammals12–15, and US dairy cattle16–19, raising questions about whether humans are next. Historically, swine are considered optimal intermediary hosts that help avian influenza viruses (AIV) adapt to mammals before jumping to humans20. However, the altered ecology of H5N1 has opened the door to new evolutionary pathways. Could dairy cattle, farmed mink, or South American sea lions serve as new mammalian gateways to humans? Here we explore the molecular and ecological factors driving H5N1’s sudden expansion in host range and assess the likelihood of different zoonotic pathways leading to an H5N1 pandemic."

 Modification of guanosine to N7-methylguanosine (m7G) in the variable loop region of tRNA is catalyzed by the METTL1/WDR4 heterodimer and stabilizes target tRNA. Here, we reveal essential functions of Mettl1 in Drosophila fertility. Knockout of Mettl1 (Mettl1-KO) causes no major effect on the development of non-gonadal tissues, but abolishes the production of elongated spermatids and mature sperm, which is fully rescued by expression of a Mettl1-transgene, but not a catalytic-dead Mettl1 transgene. This demonstrates that Mettl1-dependent m7G is required for spermatogenesis. Mettl1-KO results in a loss of m7G modification on a subset of tRNAs and decreased tRNA abundance. Ribosome profiling shows that Mettl1-KO led to ribosomes stalling at codons decoded by tRNAs that were reduced in abundance. Mettl1-KO also significantly reduces the translation efficiency of genes involved in elongated spermatid formation and sperm stability. Germ cell-specific expression of Mettl1 rescues disrupted m7G tRNA modification and tRNA abundance in Mettl1-KO testes but not in non-gonadal tissues. Ribosome stalling is much less detectable in non-gonadal tissues than in Mettl1-KO testes. These findings reveal a developmental role for m7G tRNA modification and indicate that m7G modification-dependent tRNA abundance differs among tissues. Here the authors reveal essential functions of Mettl1, catalyzing N7-guanosine methylation (m7G) of tRNAs, in Drosophila male fertility through a regulation of the steady-state level of tRNAs and the translational efficiency of genes essential for spermatogenesis."

 Reef-building coral populations face unprecedented threats from climate warming. Standing variation in heat tolerance is crucial for evolutionary processes necessary for corals to persist. Yet, the spatial distribution of heat-tolerant corals and the underlying factors that determine heat tolerance are poorly understood from individual to ecosystem scales. Here, we show extensive variation in the heat tolerance of a foundational coral species complex across the Great Barrier Reef. Thermal thresholds of 569 individuals differed by up to 7.3 °C across scales from meters to >1250 km. Variation in thresholds among reefs was consistent with local adaptation and acclimatization to historical and recent thermal history. However, variation within reefs was sometimes greater than among reefs and largely unexplained by environmental predictors, putative host species, or symbiont communities. This indicates that within-reef heat tolerance differences may be informed primarily by other factors, such as adaptive genomic variation. We anticipate our findings will inform conservation and restoration actions, including targeting individuals for selective breeding of enhanced heat tolerance. Adaptation to thermal histories governs differences in coral heat tolerance between reefs, whereas within reefs, variations in heat tolerance cannot be explained by environmental predictors and may instead be a result of genomic variations, suggesting analyses of coral samples from the Great Barrier Reef."

Despite progress in on-farm practices and urban wastewater treatment in the Chesapeake Bay (CB) watershed, limited attention has been given to nutrient transport, use, and handling between farms and urban environments. This study uses the hierarchical CAFE (Cropping system, Animal-crop system, Food system, and Ecosystem) framework to evaluate nutrient management performances within the watershed. We first develop a three-decade, county-level nutrient budget database (1985–2019), then analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of N and P budgets, as well as N and P use efficiencies, within the four CAFE hierarchies. Our results indicate a sizable increase in potential N and P losses beyond crop fields (i.e. in the Animal-crop system, Food system, and Ecosystem), surpassing losses from cropland in over 90% of counties. To address these system-wide trade-offs, we estimate the nutrient resources in waste streams beyond croplands, which, if recovered and recycled, could theoretically offset mineral fertilizer inputs in over 60% of counties. Additionally, the growing imbalance in excess N versus P across systems, which increases the N:P ratio of potential losses, could pose an emerging risk to downstream aquatic ecosystems. By utilizing a systematic approach, our novel application of the CAFE framework reveals trade-offs and synergies in nutrient management outcomes that transcend agro-environmental and political boundaries, underscores disparities in N and P management, and helps to identify unique opportunities for enhancing holistic nutrient management across systems within the CB watershed."

Despite this, our understanding of historical changes in global WFs of crops remains limited. In this study, we analyse the recently published dataset on green and blue WFs of 175 individual crops in 1990–2019. We explore the main changes in unit WFs (expressed in m3t−1 yr−1) and WFs of production (m3 yr−1) and connect the observed changes to various physical and socio-economic drivers. We find that nearly 80% of crops reduced global average unit WFs (required less water per tonne) as crop yields improved and cultivation centred around more productive areas. However, the total WF of crop production increased by 30% as these productivity gains were insufficient to compensate for cropland expansion of mostly water-intensive crops. Close to 90% of the increase occurred between 2000–2019 likely driven by accelerated economic growth, globalisation, changing diets, and production of first-generation biofuels. Among crops, we observe the largest increases for oil palm fruit, soya beans, and maize as they became the main providers of crop-based nutrients, animal feed, and biofuels for the modern economy. Among regions, most of the increase occurred across the tropics, mainly in Indonesia, Brazil, and Nigeria. However, India, China, and the USA had the largest WFs of production over the study period. Humanity consumed 6.8 trillion m3 of water (87.1% green) to produce crops in 2019. This number is likely to increase in the future which may exacerbate already existing environmental and socio-economic issues. Thus, it is important to transition to more water-sustainable agrifood systems. Much potential still exists in increasing crop water productivity, shifting production to less water-scarce geographies, and rethinking our dietary and industrial consumption patterns."

Compared with technological emission reductions, structural emission reduction can provide cities with more stable and sustainable carbon-peaking solutions. This study constructs a scenario-based input–output optimization model, adopting a novel carbon emission accounting method for purchased electricity that considers shared responsibility, and systematically evaluates the decarbonization paths of megacities and their impacts on economic growth, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. The results show that (a) through industry substitution and manufacturing restructuring, Shenzhen is projected to peak at 57.68 MtCO2 emissions in 2026, with a 10.57% energy and a 19.55% carbon reduction by 2030. (b) Shenzhen can achieve its carbon emission peak target through the energy transition while accepting a loss of 0.97%–3.23% of GDP, requiring the maximum economic concession of 16.45% from the transportation sector (S10) in the early stage of transformation, while 12.24% from the extractive industry (S2) in the later stage. (c) The comprehensive structure adjustment proved to be more effective than other mitigation approaches, capable of achieving high-quality economic growth of 6.4% during the study period while reaching a peak target of 53.55 million tons of CO2 by 2026. (d) The emission reduction effect of the power sector was the most significant among all the scenarios, with emission reduction rates between 6.26% and 35.63%, and the cumulative emission reduction potential reached 38.1–110.6 MtCO2. The priority for emission reduction in the power sector is the coal phase-out plan, which is essential for achieving these significant reductions.

Tourian,Satellite Altimetry-based Extension of global-scale in situ river discharge Measurements (SAEM),"Our study addresses the need for better river discharge data, crucial for water management, by expanding global gauge networks with satellite data. We used satellite altimetry to estimate river discharge for over 8,700 stations worldwide, filling gaps in existing records. Our data set, SAEM supports a better understanding of water systems, helping to manage water resources more effectively, especially in regions with limited monitoring infrastructure. 
 River discharge is a crucial measurement, indicating the volume of water flowing through a river cross-section at any given time. However, the existing network of river discharge gauges faces significant issues, largely due to the declining number of active gauges and temporal gaps. Remote sensing, especially radar-based techniques, offers an effective means to this issue. This study introduces the Satellite Altimetry-based Extension of the global-scale in situ river discharge Measurements (SAEM) data set, which utilizes multiple satellite altimetry missions and estimates discharge using the existing worldwide networks of national and international gauges. In SAEM, we have explored 47 000 gauges and estimated height-based discharge for 8 730 of them which is approximately three times the number of gauges of the largest existing remote sensing-based data set. These gauges cover approximately 88 % of the total gauged discharge volume. The height-based discharge estimates in SAEM demonstrate a median Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.48, outperforming current global data sets. In addition to the river discharge time series, the SAEMdata set comprises three more products, each contributing a unique facet to better usage of our data: (1) A catalog of Virtual Stations (VSs), defined by certain predefined criteria. In addition to each station’s coordinates, this catalog provides information on satellite altimetry missions, distance to the discharge gauge, and relevant quality flags.(2) The altimetric water level time series of those VSs are included, for which we ultimately obtained good-quality discharge data. These water level time series are sourced from both existing Level-3 water level time series and newly generated ones within this study. The Level-3 data are gathered from pre-existing data sets, including Hydroweb.Next (former Hydroweb), the Database of Hydrological Time Series of Inland Waters (DAHITI), the Global River Radar Altimeter Time Series (GRRATS), and HydroSat. (3) SAEM’s third product is rating curves for the defined VSs, which map water level values into discharge values, derived using a Nonparametric Stochastic Quantile Mapping Function approach. The SAEM data set can be used to improve hydrological models, inform water resource management, and address non-linear water-related challenges under climate change.

A preliminary budget identifies benthic CH4 release as the dominant source and two main sinks: CH4 oxidation in the water (92 % of sinks) and outgassing to the atmosphere (8 % of sinks). This study addresses CH4 emissions from coastal seas and is a first step toward understanding the relative importance of open-water outgassing compared with local coastal hotspots. 
 Methane (CH4) cycling in the Baltic Sea is studied through model simulations that incorporate the stable isotopes of CH4 (12C–CH4 and 13C–CH4) in a physical–biogeochemical model. A major uncertainty is that spatial and temporal variations in the sediment source are not well known. Furthermore, the coarse spatial resolution prevents the model from resolving shallow-water near-shore areas for which measurements indicate occurrences of considerably higher CH4 concentrations and emissions compared with the open Baltic Sea. A preliminary CH4 budget for the central Baltic Sea (the Baltic Proper) identifies benthic release as the dominant CH4 source, which is largely balanced by oxidation in the water column and to a smaller degree by outgassing. The contributions from river loads and lateral exchange with adjacent areas are of marginal importance. Simulated total CH4 emissions from the Baltic Proper correspond to an average ∼1.5 mmol CH4 m−2 yr−1, which can be compared to a fitted sediment source of ∼18 mmol CH4 m−2 yr−1. A large-scale approach is used in this study, but the parameterizations and parameters presented here could also be implemented in models of near-shore areas where CH4 concentrations and fluxes are typically substantially larger and more variable. Currently, it is not known how important local shallow-water CH4 hotspots are compared with the open water outgassing in the Baltic Sea."

Our study improves modeling of carbon cycling in Arctic ecosystems. We developed an automated method to fine-tune a model that simulates carbon and nitrogen flows, using computer-generated data. Using computer-generated data, we tested our method and found it enhances accuracy and reduces the time needed for calibration. This work helps make climate predictions more reliable in sensitive permafrost regions. 
 The permafrost region contains a significant portion of the world's soil organic carbon, and its thawing, driven by accelerated Arctic warming, could lead to the substantial release of greenhouse gases, potentially disrupting the global climate system. Accurate predictions of carbon cycling in permafrost ecosystems hinge on the robust calibration of model parameters. However, manually calibrating numerous parameters in complex process-based models is labor-intensive and further complicated by equifinality – the presence of multiple parameter sets that can equally fit the observed data. Incorrect calibration can lead to unrealistic ecological predictions. In this study, we employed the Model Analysis and Decision Support (MADS) software package to automate and enhance the accuracy of parameter calibration for carbon dynamics within the coupled Dynamic Vegetation Model, Dynamic Organic Soil Model, and Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (DVM-DOS-TEM), a process-based ecosystem model designed for high-latitude regions. The calibration process involved adjusting rate-limiting parameters to accurately replicate observed carbon and nitrogen fluxes and stocks in both soil and vegetation. Gross primary production, net primary production, vegetation carbon, vegetation nitrogen, and soil carbon and nitrogen pools served as synthetic observations for a black spruce boreal forest ecosystem. To validate the efficiency of this new calibration method, we utilized model-generated synthetic observations. This study demonstrates the calibration workflow, offers an in-depth analysis of the relationships between parameters and synthetic observations, and evaluates the accuracy of the calibrated parameter values."

Pollutants such as arsenic (As) in the soil can infiltrate groundwater through sinkholes and bedrock fractures in karst terrains. Despite this, the underlying mechanisms responsible for As release from karst soils under redox changes remain largely unexplored. Here, we used multiple synchrotron-based spectroscopic analyses to explore As mobilization and sequestration in As-polluted karstic soil under biogeochemical conditions that mimic field-validated redox conditions. We observed that As in the soil exists primarily as As(V), which is mainly associated with Fe(oxyhydr)oxides. The concentration of the dissolved As was high (294 μM) and As(III) was dominant (∼95%) at low Eh (≤−100 mV), indicating the high risk of As leaching under reducing conditions. This As mobilization was attributed to the fact that the dissolution of ferrihydrite and calcite promoted the release and reduction of associated As(V). The concentration of the dissolved As was low (17.0 μM) and As(V) was dominant (∼68%) at high Eh (≥+100 mV), which might be due to the oxidation and/or sequestration of As(III) by the recrystallized ferric phase. Our results showed that the combined effects of the reductive release of As(V) from both ferric and nonferric phases, along with the recrystallization of the ferric phase, govern the redox-induced mobilization and potential leaching of As in soils within karst environments."

In the present study, we characterized the developmental toxicity of metformin in zebrafish, utilizing a transcriptome-guided toxicological assessment framework. Transcriptomic analysis conducted at metformin concentrations within the μg/L range revealed significant disruptions in biological processes associated with nucleotide, hydrocarbon, and amino acid metabolism, suggesting a significant disturbance in energy homeostasis. This observation was corroborated by energy-targeted metabolomic analysis, wherein a considerable number of metabolites involved in purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and the citrate cycle displayed significant alterations. Notably, most intermediates in the citrate cycle such as acetyl-CoA exhibited remarkable decreases. Additionally, our study identified significant impediments in zebrafish embryonic development, including decreased yolk extension progress, spontaneous contraction and body length, and increased yolk sac area and yolk/while body lipid content ratio, at metformin concentrations as low as 0.12 μg/L. Furthermore, the disruption of energy homeostasis by metformin was observed to persist into adulthood even after a prolonged recovery period. The present findings highlighted the disruptive effects of metformin on energy homeostasis and embryonic development in teleost at environmentally relevant concentrations, thereby prompting a reevaluation of its environmental risk to nontarget aquatic organisms."

In the approach presented here, groundwater from beneath streambeds was analyzed for PFAS and age-dated using SF6 and 3H/3He. The results were coupled with groundwater flux measurements in a convolution approach to estimate past and future PFAS concentrations in groundwater discharge to the streams. At our test site near the Cape Fear River (CFR) of North Carolina, PFAS were detected in groundwater up to 43 years old, suggesting that some PFAS entered groundwater immediately or shortly after fluorochemical production began at the nearby Fayetteville Works. Results are consistent with little to no retardation in groundwater for perfluoroethers such as hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO–DA) and perfluoro-2-methoxypropanoic acid (PMPA), the two most abundant PFAS, with mean concentrations of 229 and 498 ng/L, respectively. Future PFAS concentrations in groundwater discharge to streams were estimated to remain above current MCL or health advisory levels through at least 2050 or 2060 (using 3H/3He and SF6, respectively). Recent atmospheric deposition data suggest lower but non-negligible amounts of PFAS may continue to enter groundwater, likely further extending PFAS persistence in groundwater and the adjacent CFR.

TmFae-PETase showed a preference for the hydrolysis of ferulic acid methyl ester (MFA) in the presence of both PET and MFA. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations of TmFae-PETase revealed similar catalytic mechanisms for both PET and MFA. TmFae-PETase effectively depolymerized commercial PET, making it a promising candidate for application.

We hypothesized that gas chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) workflows could be enhanced by minimizing lipid coextractives, thereby enabling larger injection volumes and lower matrix interference for improved target sensitivity and nontarget molecular discovery. A simple protocol was developed for small plasma volumes (100–200 μL) by using isohexane (H) to extract supernatants of acetonitrile-plasma (A-P). The HA-P method was quantitative for a wide range of hydrophobic multiclass target analytes (i.e., log Kow > 3.0), and the extracts were free of major lipids, thereby enabling robust large-volume injections (LVIs; 25 μL) in long sequences (60–70 h, 70–80 injections) to a GC-Orbitrap HRMS. Without lipid removal, LVI was counterproductive because method sensitivity suffered from the abundant matrix signal, resulting in low ion injection times to the Orbitrap. The median method quantification limit was 0.09 ng/mL (range 0.005–4.83 ng/mL), and good accuracy was shown for a certified reference serum. Applying the method to plasma from a Swedish cohort (n = 32; 100 μL), 51 of 103 target analytes were detected. Simultaneous nontarget analysis resulted in 112 structural annotations (12.8% annotation rate), and Level 1 identification was achieved for 7 of 8 substances in follow-up confirmations.

In this study, marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma), typically inhabiting 30‰ high salinity, were gradually acclimated to low salinities of 20, 10, and 0‰. Following acclimation, the fish were exposed to arsenate (As(V)) in their diet for 30 days. Results showed a significant accumulation of total arsenic (As) and AsB concentrations in the muscle and head tissues of the exposed fish, with these accumulations exhibiting a positive correlation with water salinity. Transcriptome analyses revealed that exposure to As(V) at low salinity may disrupt membrane components and induce cytoskeletal injuries, while at high salinity, it triggered oxidoreductase activity and transmembrane transport. Metabolome analyses indicated that low salinity induced osmotic stress, resulting in an increased requirement for amino acids to upload intracellular osmotic equilibrium in O. melastigma. Furthermore, the key organic osmolytes and amino acids, including taurine, l-methionine, guanidinoethyl sulfonate, and N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid, exhibited a negative correlation with the AsB concentration. These findings indicated that salinity can regulate osmotic balance by influencing amino acid synthesis under low salinity and stimulating AsB synthesis under high salinity conditions in O. melastigma. This study provides insights into the impact of high salinity on AsB biosynthesis, the underlying regulatory mechanisms, and implications for managing As(V) risk."

This enhanced oxidation in ice is attributed to the concentration of protons, birnessite, or bromide in the ice grain boundary region. Furthermore, different types of commercial manganese oxides can also oxidize bromide to RBr and release Mn(II) in ice. The presence of fulvic acid (FA) further increases the simultaneous production of RBr and Mn(II) in ice, accompanying the formation of organobromine compounds (OBCs). In frozen δ-MnO2/Br–/FA system, a significant increase in OBCs, mainly highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds, was detected using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. A marked contrast was observed in the number of OBCs formed in frozen solutions (853 and 415 OBCs at initial pH 3.0 and 5.8, respectively) compared to their aqueous counterparts (11 and 23 OBCs).

This study investigated the bioaccumulation of atmospherically deposited Cd in soybean using a three-year fully factorial atmospheric exposure experiment incorporating Cd isotope analysis. Results shown that atmospheric deposition accounted for 1–13% of soil Cd pools, yet contributed 11–72% of Cd to soybean tissues during the growing seasons. Over the course of soil exposure to atmospheric deposition ranging from 1 to 3 years, no notable variations were observed in Cd concentrations in soil solutions and soybean tissues, nor in isotope ratios. Newly deposited Cd was a major source in soybean plants, and the bioavailability of deposited Cd rapidly aged in soils. Atmospheric Cd enriched in lighter isotopes induced negative isotope shifts in soybean plants. By employing an optimized isotope mixing model in conjunction with a mass balance approach, foliar Cd uptake contributed 13–51%, 16–45%, and 21–56% to stem, leaf, and seed, respectively.

 In March 2024, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 infections in dairy cows were first reported from Texas, USA1. Rapid dissemination to more than 190 farms in 13 states followed2. Here, we provide results of two independent clade 2.3.4.4b experimental infection studies evaluating (i) oronasal susceptibility and transmission in calves to a US H5N1 bovine isolate genotype B3.13 (H5N1 B3.13) and (ii) susceptibility of lactating cows following direct mammary gland inoculation of either H5N1 B3.13 or a current EU H5N1 wild bird isolate genotype euDG (H5N1 euDG). Inoculation of the calves resulted in moderate nasal replication and shedding with no severe clinical signs or transmission to sentinel calves. In dairy cows, infection resulted in no nasal shedding, but severe acute mammary gland infection with necrotizing mastitis and high fever was observed for both H5N1 isolates. Milk production was rapidly and drastically reduced and the physical condition of the cows was severely compromised. Virus titers in milk rapidly peaked at 108 TCID50/mL, but systemic infection did not ensue. Notably, adaptive mutation PB2 E627K emerged after intramammary replication of H5N1 euDG. Our data suggest that in addition to H5N1 B3.13, other HPAIV H5N1 strains have the potential to replicate in the udder of cows and that milk and milking procedures, rather than respiratory spread, are likely the primary routes of H5N1 transmission between cattle."

Tarnita,The evolution of private reputations in information-abundant landscapes,"In an information-abundant landscape, people can accurately judge the reputations of others by researching only a fraction of the available information while forgiving some instances of bad behaviour. 
 Reputations are critical to human societies, as individuals are treated differently based on their social standing1,2. For instance, those who garner a good reputation by helping others are more likely to be rewarded by third parties3–5. Achieving widespread cooperation in this way requires that reputations accurately reflect behaviour6 and that individuals agree about each other’s standings7. With few exceptions8–10, theoretical work has assumed that information is limited, which hinders consensus7,11 unless there are mechanisms to enforce agreement, such as empathy12, gossip13–15 or public institutions16. Such mechanisms face challenges in a world where empathy, effective communication and institutional trust are compromised17–19. However, information about others is now abundant and readily available, particularly through social media. Here we demonstrate that assigning private reputations by aggregating several observations of an individual can accurately capture behaviour, foster emergent agreement without enforcement mechanisms and maintain cooperation, provided individuals exhibit some tolerance for bad actions. This finding holds for both first- and second-order norms of judgement and is robust even when norms vary within a population. When the aggregation rule itself can evolve, selection indeed favours the use of several observations and tolerant judgements. Nonetheless, even when information is freely accessible, individuals do not typically evolve to use all of it. This method of assessing reputations—‘look twice, forgive once’, in a nutshell—is simple enough to have arisen early in human culture and powerful enough to persist as a fundamental component of social heuristics. In an information-abundant landscape, people can accurately judge the reputations of others by researching only a fraction of the available information while forgiving some instances of bad behaviour."

 El Niño events, the warm phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, amplify climate variability throughout the world1. Uncertain climate model predictions limit our ability to assess whether these climatic events could become more extreme under anthropogenic greenhouse warming2. Palaeoclimate records provide estimates of past changes, but it is unclear if they can constrain mechanisms underlying future predictions3–5. Here we uncover a mechanism using numerical simulations that drives consistent changes in response to past and future forcings, allowing model validation against palaeoclimate data. The simulated mechanism is consistent with the dynamics of observed extreme El Niño events, which develop when western Pacific warm pool waters expand rapidly eastwards because of strongly coupled ocean currents and winds6,7. These coupled interactions weaken under glacial conditions because of a deeper mixed layer driven by a stronger Walker circulation. The resulting decrease in ENSO variability and extreme El Niño occurrence is supported by a series of tropical Pacific palaeoceanographic records showing reduced glacial temperature variability within key ENSO-sensitive oceanic regions, including new data from the central equatorial Pacific. The model–data agreement on past variability, together with the consistent mechanism across climatic states, supports the prediction of a shallower mixed layer and weaker Walker circulation driving more frequent extreme El Niño genesis under greenhouse warming. A combination of palaeoclimate proxies and simulations shows that a common mechanism controls El Niño variation in cold and warm states, which supports expectations of more extreme El Niño occurrence in the future."

 From industrial exoskeletons to implantable medical devices, robots that interact closely with people are poised to improve every aspect of our lives. Yet designing these systems is very challenging; humans are incredibly complex and, in many cases, we respond to robotic devices in ways that cannot be modelled or predicted with sufficient accuracy. A new approach, human-in-the-loop optimization, can overcome these challenges by systematically and empirically identifying the device characteristics that result in the best objective performance for a specific user and application. This approach has enabled substantial improvements in human–robot performance in research settings and has the potential to speed development and enhance products. In this Perspective, we describe methods for applying human-in-the-loop optimization to new human–robot interaction problems, addressing each key decision in a variety of contexts.

 Bacterial populations that originate from a single bacterium are not strictly clonal and often contain subgroups with distinct phenotypes1. Bacteria can generate heterogeneity through phase variation—a preprogrammed, reversible mechanism that alters gene expression levels across a population1. One well-studied type of phase variation involves enzyme-mediated inversion of specific regions of genomic DNA2. Frequently, these DNA inversions flip the orientation of promoters, turning transcription of adjacent coding regions on or off2. Through this mechanism, inversion can affect fitness, survival or group dynamics3,4. Here, we describe the development of PhaVa, a computational tool that identifies DNA inversions using long-read datasets. We also identify 372 ‘intragenic invertons’, a novel class of DNA inversions found entirely within genes, in genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates. Intragenic invertons allow a gene to encode two or more versions of a protein by flipping a DNA sequence within the coding region, thereby increasing coding capacity without increasing genome size. We validate ten intragenic invertons in the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and experimentally characterize an intragenic inverton in the thiamine biosynthesis gene thiC. Reversible DNA inversions found entirely within genes enable increased coding capacity by encoding multiple versions of a protein in bacteria and archaea."

 Cancer cells require high levels of iron for rapid proliferation, leading to significant upregulation of cell-surface transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which mediates iron uptake by binding to the iron-carrying protein transferrin1–3. Leveraging this phenomenon and the fast endocytosis rate of TfR1 (refs. 4,5), we developed transferrin receptor targeting chimeras (TransTACs), a heterobispecific antibody modality for membrane protein degradation. TransTACs are engineered to drive rapid co-internalization of a target protein of interest and TfR1 from the cell surface, and to enable target protein entry into the lysosomal degradation pathway. We show that TransTACs can efficiently degrade a diverse range of single-pass, multi-pass, native or synthetic membrane proteins, including epidermal growth factor receptor, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1, cluster of differentiation 20 and chimeric antigen receptor. In example applications, TransTACs enabled the reversible control of human primary chimeric antigen receptor T cells and the targeting of drug-resistant epidermal growth factor receptor-driven lung cancer with the exon 19 deletion/T790M/C797S mutations in a mouse xenograft model.

 There are more ways to synthesize a 100-amino acid (aa) protein (20100) than there are atoms in the universe. Only a very small fraction of such a vast sequence space can ever be experimentally or computationally surveyed. Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to navigate high-dimensional sequence spaces1. However, these models are extremely complicated. Here, by experimentally sampling from sequence spaces larger than 1010, we show that the genetic architecture of at least some proteins is remarkably simple, allowing accurate genetic prediction in high-dimensional sequence spaces with fully interpretable energy models. These models capture the nonlinear relationships between free energies and phenotypes but otherwise consist of additive free energy changes with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. These energetic couplings are sparse and associated with structural contacts and backbone proximity. Our results indicate that protein genetics is actually both rather simple and intelligible.

 The prevailing methods to make large language models more powerful and amenable have been based on continuous scaling up (that is, increasing their size, data volume and computational resources1) and bespoke shaping up (including post-filtering2,3, fine tuning or use of human feedback4,5). However, larger and more instructable large language models may have become less reliable. By studying the relationship between difficulty concordance, task avoidance and prompting stability of several language model families, here we show that easy instances for human participants are also easy for the models, but scaled-up, shaped-up models do not secure areas of low difficulty in which either the model does not err or human supervision can spot the errors. We also find that early models often avoid user questions but scaled-up, shaped-up models tend to give an apparently sensible yet wrong answer much more often, including errors on difficult questions that human supervisors frequently overlook. Moreover, we observe that stability to different natural phrasings of the same question is improved by scaling-up and shaping-up interventions, but pockets of variability persist across difficulty levels. These findings highlight the need for a fundamental shift in the design and development of general-purpose artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes areas for which a predictable distribution of errors is paramount.

 Extracting the underlying temporal structure of experience is a fundamental aspect of learning and memory that allows us to predict what is likely to happen next. Current knowledge about the neural underpinnings of this cognitive process in humans stems from functional neuroimaging research1–5. As these methods lack direct access to the neuronal level, it remains unknown how this process is computed by neurons in the human brain. Here we record from single neurons in individuals who have been implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical reasons, and show that human hippocampal and entorhinal neurons gradually modify their activity to encode the temporal structure of a complex image presentation sequence. This representation was formed rapidly, without providing specific instructions to the participants, and persisted when the prescribed experience was no longer present. Furthermore, the structure recovered from the population activity of hippocampal–entorhinal neurons closely resembled the structural graph defining the sequence, but at the same time, also reflected the probability of upcoming stimuli. Finally, learning of the sequence graph was related to spontaneous, time-compressed replay of individual neurons’ activity corresponding to previously experienced graph trajectories. These findings demonstrate that neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex integrate the ‘what’ and ‘when’ information to extract durable and predictive representations of the temporal structure of human experience. Single-neuron recordings from intracranial electrodes inserted into human brains for clinical reasons suggest that the temporal structure of human experience is encoded in human hippocampal and entorhinal neurons."

 The jet stream is an important dynamic driver of climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes1–3. Modern variability in the position of summer jet stream latitude in the North Atlantic–European sector (EU JSL) promotes dipole patterns in air pressure, temperature, precipitation and drought between northwestern and southeastern Europe. EU JSL variability and its impacts on regional climatic extremes and societal events are poorly understood, particularly before anthropogenic warming. Based on three temperature-sensitive European tree-ring records, we develop a reconstruction of interannual summer EU JSL variability over the period 1300–2004 ce (R2 = 38.5%) and compare it to independent historical documented climatic and societal records, such as grape harvest, grain prices, plagues and human mortality. Here we show contrasting summer climate extremes associated with EU JSL variability back to 1300 ce as well as biophysical, economic and human demographic impacts, including wildfires and epidemics. In light of projections for altered jet stream behaviour and intensified climate extremes, our findings underscore the importance of considering EU JSL variability when evaluating amplified future climate risk.

 l-lactate modifies proteins through lactylation1, but how this process occurs is unclear. Here we identify the alanyl-tRNA synthetases AARS1 and AARS2 (AARS1/2) as intracellular l-lactate sensors required for l-lactate to stimulate the lysine lactylome in cells. AARS1/2 and the evolutionarily conserved Escherichia coli orthologue AlaRS bind to l-lactate with micromolar affinity and they directly catalyse l-lactate for ATP-dependent lactylation on the lysine acceptor end. In response to l-lactate, AARS2 associates with cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) and mediates its lactylation and inactivation in cells and in mice. By establishing a genetic code expansion orthogonal system for lactyl-lysine incorporation, we demonstrate that the presence of a lactyl moiety at a specific cGAS amino-terminal site abolishes cGAS liquid-like phase separation and DNA sensing in vitro and in vivo. A lactyl mimetic knock-in inhibits cGAS, whereas a lactyl-resistant knock-in protects mice against innate immune evasion induced through high levels of l-lactate. MCT1 blockade inhibits cGAS lactylation in stressed mice and restores innate immune surveillance, which in turn antagonizes viral replication. Thus, AARS1/2 are conserved intracellular l-lactate sensors and have an essential role as lactyltransferases. Moreover, a chemical reaction process of lactylation targets and inactivates cGAS. The tRNA synthases AARS1 and AARS2 are identified as evolutionarily conserved sensors of intracellular l-lactate to mediate the global lysine lactylome."

 Primary production in the sunlit surface ocean is regulated by the supply of key nutrients, primarily nitrate, phosphate and iron (Fe), required by phytoplankton to fix carbon dioxide into biomass1–3. Below the surface ocean, remineralization of sinking organic matter rapidly regenerates nutrients, and microbial metabolism in the upper mesopelagic ‘twilight zone’ (200–500 m) is thought to be limited by the delivery of labile organic carbon4,5. However, few studies have examined the role of nutrients in shaping microbial production in the mesopelagic6–8. Here we report the distribution and uptake of siderophores, biomarkers for microbial Fe deficiency9 across a meridional section of the eastern Pacific Ocean. Siderophore concentrations are high not only in chronically Fe-limited surface waters but also in the twilight zone underlying the North and South Pacific subtropical gyres, two key ecosystems for the marine carbon cycle. Our findings suggest that bacterial Fe deficiency owing to low Fe availability is probably characteristic of the twilight zone in several large ocean basins, greatly expanding the region of the marine water column in which nutrients limit microbial metabolism, with potential implications for ocean carbon storage.

 The acquisition of the load-bearing dentary–squamosal jaw joint was a key step in mammalian evolution1–5. Although this innovation has received decades of study, questions remain over when and how frequently a mammalian-like skull–jaw contact evolved, hindered by a paucity of three-dimensional data spanning the non-mammaliaform cynodont–mammaliaform transition. New discoveries of derived non-mammaliaform probainognathian cynodonts from South America have much to offer to this discussion. Here, to address this issue, we used micro-computed-tomography scanning to reconstruct the jaw joint anatomy of three key probainognathian cynodonts: Brasilodon quadrangularis, the sister taxon to Mammaliaformes6–8, the tritheledontid-related Riograndia guaibensis9 and the tritylodontid Oligokyphus major. We find homoplastic evolution in the jaw joint in the approach to mammaliaforms, with ictidosaurs (Riograndia plus tritheledontids) independently evolving a dentary–squamosal contact approximately 17 million years before this character first appears in mammaliaforms of the Late Triassic period10–12. Brasilodon, contrary to previous descriptions6–8, lacks an incipient dentary condyle and squamosal glenoid and the jaws articulate solely using a plesiomorphic quadrate–articular joint. We postulate that the jaw joint underwent marked evolutionary changes in probainognathian cynodonts. Some probainognathian clades independently acquired ‘double’ craniomandibular contacts, with mammaliaforms attaining a fully independent dentary–squamosal articulation with a conspicuous dentary condyle and squamosal glenoid in the Late Triassic. The dentary–squamosal contact, which is traditionally considered to be a typical mammalian feature, therefore evolved more than once and is more evolutionary labile than previously considered.

 Endocytosis and lysosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors can be triggered by endogenous ligands. Therapeutic approaches such as lysosome-targeting chimaeras1,2 (LYTACs) and cytokine receptor-targeting chimeras3 (KineTACs) have used this to target specific proteins for degradation by fusing modified native ligands to target binding proteins. Although powerful, these approaches can be limited by competition with native ligands and requirements for chemical modification that limit genetic encodability and can complicate manufacturing, and, more generally, there may be no native ligands that stimulate endocytosis through a given receptor. Here we describe computational design approaches for endocytosis-triggering binding proteins (EndoTags) that overcome these challenges. We present EndoTags for insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), sortilin and transferrin receptors, and show that fusing these tags to soluble or transmembrane target protein binders leads to lysosomal trafficking and target degradation. As these receptors have different tissue distributions, the different EndoTags could enable targeting of degradation to different tissues. EndoTag fusion to a PD-L1 antibody considerably increases efficacy in a mouse tumour model compared to antibody alone. The modularity and genetic encodability of EndoTags enables AND gate control for higher-specificity targeted degradation, and the localized secretion of degraders from engineered cells. By promoting endocytosis, EndoTag fusion increases signalling through an engineered ligand–receptor system by nearly 100-fold. EndoTags have considerable therapeutic potential as targeted degradation inducers, signalling activators for endocytosis-dependent pathways, and cellular uptake inducers for targeted antibody–drug and antibody–RNA conjugates. Computationally designed genetically encoded proteins can be used to target surface proteins, thereby triggering endocytosis and subsequent intracellular degradation, activating signalling or increasing cellular uptake in specific tissues."

 Unlike non-polar semiconductors such as silicon, the broken inversion symmetry of the wide-bandgap semiconductor gallium nitride (GaN) leads to a large electronic polarization along a unique crystal axis1. This makes the two surfaces of the semiconductor wafer perpendicular to the polar axis substantially different in their physical and chemical properties2. In the past three decades, the cation (gallium) face of GaN has been used for photonic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers3–5. Although the cation face has also been predominantly used for electronic devices, the anion (nitrogen) face has recently shown promise for high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) owing to favourable polarization discontinuities6. In this work, we introduce dualtronics, showing that it is possible to make photonic devices on the cation face and electronic devices on the anion face of the same semiconductor wafer. This opens the possibility for making use of both faces of polar semiconductors in a single structure, in which electronic, photonic and acoustic properties can be implemented on opposite faces of the same wafer, markedly enhancing the functional capabilities of this revolutionary semiconductor family. A new approach is described for fabricating devices on each of the faces of the same gallium nitride semiconductor wafer, using the cation face for photonic devices and the anion face for electronic devices."

 Current cancer immunotherapy predominately focuses on eliciting type 1 immune responses fighting cancer; however, long-term complete remission remains uncommon1,2. A pivotal question arises as to whether type 2 immunity can be orchestrated alongside type 1-centric immunotherapy to achieve enduring response against cancer3,4. Here we show that an interleukin-4 fusion protein (Fc–IL-4), a typical type 2 cytokine, directly acts on CD8+ T cells and enriches functional terminally exhausted CD8+ T (CD8+ TTE) cells in the tumour. Consequently, Fc–IL-4 enhances antitumour efficacy of type 1 immunity-centric adoptive T cell transfer or immune checkpoint blockade therapies and induces durable remission across several syngeneic and xenograft tumour models. Mechanistically, we discovered that Fc–IL-4 signals through both signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, augmenting the glycolytic metabolism and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) concentration of CD8+ TTE cells in a lactate dehydrogenase A-dependent manner. The metabolic modulation mediated by Fc–IL-4 is indispensable for reinvigorating intratumoural CD8+ TTE cells. These findings underscore Fc–IL-4 as a potent type 2 cytokine-based immunotherapy that synergizes effectively with type 1 immunity to elicit long-lasting responses against cancer. Our study not only sheds light on the synergy between these two types of immune responses, but also unveils an innovative strategy for advancing next-generation cancer immunotherapy by integrating type 2 immune factors.

 Monoatomic-layered carbon materials, such as graphene1 and amorphous monolayer carbon2,3, have stimulated intense fundamental and applied research owing to their unprecedented physical properties and a wide range of promising applications4,5. So far, such materials have mainly been produced by chemical vapour deposition, which typically requires stringent reaction conditions compared to solution-phase synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate the solution preparation of free-standing nitrogen-doped amorphous monolayer carbon with mixed five-, six- and seven-membered (5-6-7-membered) rings through the polymerization of pyrrole within the confined interlayer cavity of a removable layered-double-hydroxide template. Structural characterizations and first-principles calculations suggest that the nitrogen-doped amorphous monolayer carbon was formed by radical polymerization of pyrrole at the α, β and N sites subjected to confinement of the reaction space, which enables bond rearrangements through the Stone–Wales transformation. The spatial confinement inhibits the C–C bond rotation and chain entanglement during polymerization, resulting in an atom-thick continuous amorphous layer with an in-plane π-conjugation electronic structure. The spatially confined radical polymerization using solid templates and ion exchange strategy demonstrates potential as a universal synthesis approach for obtaining two-dimensional covalent networks, as exemplified by the successful synthesis of monolayers of polythiophene and polycarbazole.

 Bacteria defend against phage infection through a variety of antiphage defence systems1. Many defence systems were recently shown to deplete cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in response to infection, by cleaving NAD+ into ADP-ribose (ADPR) and nicotinamide2–7. It was demonstrated that NAD+ depletion during infection deprives the phage of this essential molecule and impedes phage replication. Here we show that a substantial fraction of phages possess enzymatic pathways allowing reconstitution of NAD+ from its degradation products in infected cells. We describe NAD+ reconstitution pathway 1 (NARP1), a two-step pathway in which one enzyme phosphorylates ADPR to generate ADPR pyrophosphate (ADPR-PP), and the second enzyme conjugates ADPR-PP and nicotinamide to generate NAD+. Phages encoding NARP1 can overcome a diverse set of defence systems, including Thoeris, DSR1, DSR2, SIR2–HerA and SEFIR, all of which deplete NAD+ as part of their defensive mechanism. Phylogenetic analyses show that NARP1 is primarily encoded on phage genomes, suggesting a phage-specific function in countering bacterial defences. A second pathway, NARP2, allows phages to overcome bacterial defences by building NAD+ using metabolites different from ADPR-PP. Our findings reveal a unique immune evasion strategy in which viruses rebuild molecules depleted by defence systems, thus overcoming host immunity. A study shows that many phages are capable of evading antiphage defence systems of bacteria by reconstituting NAD+ from its degradation products in infected cells."

 Down syndrome predisposes individuals to haematological abnormalities, such as increased number of erythrocytes and leukaemia in a process that is initiated before birth and is not entirely understood1–3. Here, to understand dysregulated haematopoiesis in Down syndrome, we integrated single-cell transcriptomics of over 1.1 million cells with chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomics datasets using human fetal liver and bone marrow samples from 3 fetuses with disomy and 15 fetuses with trisomy. We found that differences in gene expression in Down syndrome were dependent on both cell type and environment. Furthermore, we found multiple lines of evidence that haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in Down syndrome are ‘primed’ to differentiate. We subsequently established a Down syndrome-specific map linking non-coding elements to genes in disomic and trisomic HSCs using 10X multiome data. By integrating this map with genetic variants associated with blood cell counts, we discovered that trisomy restructured regulatory interactions to dysregulate enhancer activity and gene expression critical to erythroid lineage differentiation. Furthermore, as mutations in Down syndrome display a signature of oxidative stress4,5, we validated both increased mitochondrial mass and oxidative stress in Down syndrome, and observed that these mutations preferentially fell into regulatory regions of expressed genes in HSCs. Together, our single-cell, multi-omic resource provides a high-resolution molecular map of fetal haematopoiesis in Down syndrome and indicates significant regulatory restructuring giving rise to co-occurring haematological conditions.

 Despite a high response rate in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL)1–3, approximately 50% of patients relapse within the first year4–6, representing an urgent question to address in the next stage of cellular immunotherapy. Here, to investigate the molecular determinants of ultralong CAR T cell persistence, we obtained a single-cell multi-omics atlas from 695,819 pre-infusion CAR T cells at the basal level or after CAR-specific stimulation from 82 paediatric patients with ALL enrolled in the first two CAR T ALL clinical trials and 6 healthy donors. We identified that elevated type 2 functionality in CAR T infusion products is significantly associated with patients maintaining a median B cell aplasia duration of 8.4 years. Analysis of ligand–receptor interactions revealed that type 2 cells regulate a dysfunctional subset to maintain whole-population homeostasis, and the addition of IL-4 during antigen-specific activation alleviates CAR T cell dysfunction while enhancing fitness at both transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. Serial proteomic profiling of sera after treatment revealed a higher level of circulating type 2 cytokines in 5-year or 8-year relapse-free responders. In a leukaemic mouse model, type 2high CAR T cell products demonstrated superior expansion and antitumour activity, particularly after leukaemia rechallenge. Restoring antitumour efficacy in type 2low CAR T cells was attainable by enhancing their type 2 functionality, either through incorporating IL-4 into the manufacturing process or by priming manufactured CAR T products with IL-4 before infusion. Our findings provide insights into the mediators of durable CAR T therapy response and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to sustain long-term remission by boosting type 2 functionality in CAR T cells. Elevated type 2 functionality in CAR T cell infusion products is significantly associated with maintenance of a median B cell aplasia duration of 8.4 years in paediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia."

 Covalent bonds share electron pairs between two atoms and make up the skeletons of most organic compounds in single, double and triple bonds. In contrast, examples of one-electron bonds remain scarce, most probably due to their intrinsic weakness1–4. Although several pioneering studies have reported one-electron bonds between heteroatoms, direct evidence for one-electron bonds between carbon atoms remains elusive. Here we report the isolation of a compound with a one-electron σ-bond between carbon atoms by means of the one-electron oxidation of a hydrocarbon with an elongated C–C single bond5,6. The presence of the C•C one-electron σ-bond (2.921(3) Å at 100 K) was confirmed experimentally by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy, and theoretically by density functional theory calculations. The results of this paper unequivocally demonstrate the existence of a C•C one-electron σ-bond, which was postulated nearly a century ago7, and can thus be expected to pave the way for further development in different areas of chemistry by probing the boundary between bonded and non-bonded states. The one-electron oxidation of a hydrocarbon with an elongated C–C single bond provides direct evidence for a one-electron σ-bond between carbon atoms."

 The ribonuclease FttA (also known as aCPSF and aCPSF1) mediates factor-dependent transcription termination in archaea1–3. Here we report the structure of a Thermococcus kodakarensis transcription pre-termination complex comprising FttA, Spt4, Spt5 and a transcription elongation complex (TEC). The structure shows that FttA interacts with the TEC in a manner that enables RNA to proceed directly from the TEC RNA-exit channel to the FttA catalytic centre and that enables endonucleolytic cleavage of RNA by FttA, followed by 5′→3′ exonucleolytic cleavage of RNA by FttA and concomitant 5′→3′ translocation of FttA on RNA, to apply mechanical force to the TEC and trigger termination. The structure further reveals that Spt5 bridges FttA and the TEC, explaining how Spt5 stimulates FttA-dependent termination. The results reveal functional analogy between bacterial and archaeal factor-dependent termination, functional homology between archaeal and eukaryotic factor-dependent termination, and fundamental mechanistic similarities in factor-dependent termination in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.

 Mutant selective drugs targeting the inactive, GDP-bound form of KRASG12C have been approved for use in lung cancer, but resistance develops rapidly. Here we use an inhibitor, (RMC-4998) that targets RASG12C in its active, GTP-bound form, to treat KRAS mutant lung cancer in various immune competent mouse models. RAS pathway reactivation after RMC-4998 treatment could be delayed using combined treatment with a SHP2 inhibitor, which not only impacts tumour cell RAS signalling but also remodels the tumour microenvironment to be less immunosuppressive. In an immune inflamed model, RAS and SHP2 inhibitors in combination drive durable responses by suppressing tumour relapse and inducing development of immune memory. In an immune excluded model, combined RAS and SHP2 inhibition sensitises tumours to immune checkpoint blockade, leading to efficient tumour immune rejection.

 Cells harvest energy from ionic gradients by selective ion transport across membranes, and the same principle is recently being used for osmotic power generation from salinity gradients at ocean-river interfaces. Common to these ionic gradient conversions is that they require intricate nanoscale structures. Here, we show that natural submarine serpentinite-hosted hydrothermal vent (HV) precipitates are capable of converting ionic gradients into electrochemical energy by selective transport of Na+, K+, H+, and Cl-. Layered hydroxide nanocrystals are aligned radially outwards from the HV fluid channels, constituting confined nanopores that span millimeters in the HV wall. The nanopores change the surface charge depending on adsorbed ions, allowing the mineral to function as a cation- and anion-selective ion transport membrane. Our findings indicate that chemical disequilibria originating from flow and concentration gradients in geologic environments generate confined nanospaces which enable the spontaneous establishment of osmotic energy conversion.

Cost–benefit analysis shows that the main barriers lie in the non-pecuniary costs of behaviour switching, and highlights opportunities for targeted policy intervention. 
 Demand-side mitigation relies on individuals’ and households’ willingness to alter their consumption habits and daily routines to reduce their carbon footprint. Despite optimistic forecasts for well-being improvements, broad adoption of these behavioural changes remains elusive. Our study analyses 12 behaviours in Beijing, China, using a cost–benefit approach that includes both tangible (pecuniary) and intangible (non-pecuniary) benefits. Our findings indicate that eight behaviours result in individual-level welfare loss. Even after accounting for mitigation benefits, seven behaviours still incur social-welfare loss. Monte Carlo simulations unveil substantial variability in welfare impacts, highlighting opportunities for targeted policy interventions. Depending on the perspective (individual versus societal) and the goal (welfare versus mitigation), we recommend four demand-side practices for Beijing policymakers. In addition, we propose actionable steps on the basis of sensitivity analyses. This study underscores the need for an objective and universally applicable framework to evaluate demand-side behaviours and optimize emissions reduction potential. Demand-side mitigation solutions are seen as an essential part for climate actions, yet their adoption is still lower than expected. Cost–benefit analysis shows that the main barriers lie in the non-pecuniary costs of behaviour switching, and highlights opportunities for targeted policy intervention."

An analysis based on historical trends in policy-driven technologies, current plans and their failure rates shows that a number of 2 °C pathways are feasible, but most 1.5 °C pathways are not. 
 Climate change mitigation requires the large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Recent plans indicate an eight-fold increase in CCS capacity by 2030, yet the feasibility of CCS expansion is debated. Using historical growth of CCS and other policy-driven technologies, we show that if plans double between 2023 and 2025 and their failure rates decrease by half, CCS could reach 0.37 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2030—lower than most 1.5 °C pathways but higher than most 2 °C pathways. Staying on-track to 2 °C would require that in 2030–2040 CCS accelerates at least as fast as wind power did in the 2000s, and that after 2040, it grows faster than nuclear power did in the 1970s to 1980s. Only 10% of mitigation pathways meet these feasibility constraints, and virtually all of them depict <600 GtCO2 captured and stored by 2100. Relaxing the constraints by assuming no failures of CCS plans and growth as fast as flue-gas desulfurization would approximately double this amount. Carbon capture and storage is a key component of mitigation scenarios, yet its feasibility is debated.

 Mantle plumes are responsible for the Earth’s largest volcanic provinces. In the prevailing paradigm, the deep mantle is less degassed than convecting shallow mantle, implying that plume-derived lavas have higher concentrations of primordial volatiles such as helium (He). Demonstrating this has led to explanations that question the established Earth model. Here, we show that the 3He/4He of basalts from the Red Sea display coherent relationships with trace elements, allowing the helium concentration of the Afar plume to be calculated. Contrary to the prevailing model it appears the helium concentration of the Afar plume is 10-25% of the upper mantle. This contradiction is resolved if the plume material itself is a mixture of helium-rich high-3He/4He deep mantle with helium-depleted low-3He/4He recently subducted oceanic crust. This implies that helium-depleted domains may exist in convecting mantle and that moderately high 3He/4He plumes likely do not contain a notable contribution of the deep mantle. Submarine lavas from the Afar mantle plume have lower helium concentrations than the MORB, suggesting that local mantle domains are helium-depleted due to subduction of oceanic crust into the mantle, according to helium isotopic signatures of basaltic glasses from the Red Sea-Gulf of Tadjoura."

 The world’s first scientific satellite for sustainable development goals (SDGSAT-1) provides valuable data about offshore small-scale ocean phenomena, including the Kármán vortex street phenomenon. Although the simulation of the oceanic vortex street phenomenon is crucial for understanding not only the mechanisms of vortex formation in fluid dynamics but also their impact on the surrounding environment, the traditional simulation relies on the strong theoretical hypothesis of Navier–Stokes equations. Here, we propose a self-supervised neural network with high generalization ability to implement Navier–Stokes equations, simulating realistic oceanic vortex streets. Specifically, the physical informed convolutional neural network is first employed to determine the corresponding pressure and velocity fields, achieving accurate simulation of oceanic vortex streets with lower computational cost; Then, the observational islands in SDGSAT-1 imagery are embedded as obstacles, meanwhile, the marine background field including wind and terrain is synchronously incorporated to achieve more realistic simulation results compared with traditional methods; Finally, the morphological parameters of oceanic vortex streets are calculated and associated analysis are carried out to deepen our understanding of small scale vortex street phenomena. In addition, the experimental results demonstrated our proposed method can obtain promising time efficiency.

 Urban green spaces (UGS) provide ecological and habitat benefits such as carbon sequestration, oxygen production, humidity increase, noise reduction, and pollution absorption. UGS maps derived from remote sensing images serve as the fundamental data for urban planning and carbon sequestration assessments. However, the spatial resolution of remote sensing image and the pattern of urban structures significantly influence UGS mapping, making it challenging to obtain accurate UGS maps. To investigate the impact of spatial resolution on UGS mapping, this study utilized five different spatial resolution datasets: Gaofen2 (1 m, 4 m), Sentinel2 (10 m), and Landsat8 (15 m, 30 m). Random forest, LightGBM, and support vector machine were employed to map UGS, and the accuracies of UGS maps at different spatial resolutions were compared. Subsequently, the spatial distribution patterns of uncertainties in UGS maps were analyzed from both overall and urban functional zone perspectives. Furthermore, the uncertainty analysis of UGS mapping was conducted considering different landscape patterns in urban functional zones. The results indicate: (1) UGS map varies at different spatial resolution. Higher uncertainties associated with coarser spatial resolutions. Medium and coarse spatial resolution images inadequately capture the fine-grained distribution of urban green spaces. (2) Uncertainty in UGS mapping at different spatial resolutions is generally consistent in spatial distribution. From a functional zoning perspective, the accuracy of green space mapping over non-natural zones is sensitive to spatial resolution. (3) The distribution pattern of UGS patches affects the accuracy of UGS mapping. Uncertainty can be reduced in UGS mapping at medium and coarse spatial resolutions based on UGS landscape pattern indices by multiple linear regression, random forest and LightGBM model. This study comprehensively reveals that uncertainties in mapping UGS from multi-spatial resolution remote sensing images vary across urban functional zones and landscape pattern indices, and it is the first attempt to propose methods for UGS area correction based on landscape pattern indices. The results of this study will facilitate the application of remote sensing data at different spatial resolutions in urban areas."

Moreover, the NIR irradiation induces reactive oxygen species production, suppressing tumor growth and inhibiting bypass signaling pathways. The designed drug delivery system offers a highly controlled and targeted therapeutic approach, effectively inhibiting tumor growth, suppressing bypass signaling pathways, and overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance, thus offering a potential solution for maximizing therapeutic benefits."

Drawing inspiration from the unparalleled selectivity of biological systems, which benefit from the sophisticated spatial organization of functionalities, we posit that manipulating the arrangement of the membrane’s building blocks, an aspect previously given limited attention, can address this challenge. We demonstrate that optimizing the face-to-face orientation of building blocks during the assembly of covalent-organic-framework (COF) membranes improves ion-π interactions with multivalent ions. This optimization leads to extraordinary selectivity in differentiating between monovalent cations and anions from their multivalent counterparts, achieving selectivity factors of 214 for K+/Al3+and 451 for NO3−/PO43−. Leveraging this attribute, the COF membrane facilitates the direct extraction of NaCl from seawater with a purity of 99.57%.

The fate of that carbon remains poorly constrained. The hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks, rich in Fe(II) and Mg, forms both abiotic methane, serpentine, and high-surface-area smectite clays. Given the abundance of ultramafic rocks and smectite in the Martian upper crust and the growing evidence of organic carbon in Martian sedimentary rocks, we quantify the effects of ultramafic alteration on the carbon cycle of early Mars. We calculate the capacity of Noachian-age clays to store organic carbon. Up to 1.7 bar of CO2can plausibly be adsorbed on clay surfaces. Coupling abiotic methanogenesis with best estimates of Mars’ δ13C history predicts a reservoir of 0.6 to 1.3 bar of CO2equivalent.

 We present a high-resolution hydrometeorological and snow dataset from the alpine Dischma watershed and its surroundings in eastern Switzerland, including station measurements of variables such as snow depth and catchment runoff. This dataset is particularly suited for different modelling experiments using distributed and process-based models, including physics-based snow and hydrological models. Additionally, the data is highly useful for testing various snow data assimilation schemes and for developing models representing snow-forest interactions.

This sets a benchmark for hydrologic estimates around the world and builds foundations for improving global hydrologic simulations. 
 Accurate hydrologic modeling is vital to characterizing how the terrestrial water cycle responds to climate change. Pure deep learning (DL) models have been shown to outperform process-based ones while remaining difficult to interpret. More recently, differentiable physics-informed machine learning models with a physical backbone can systematically integrate physical equations and DL, predicting untrained variables and processes with high performance. However, it is unclear if such models are competitive for global-scale applications with a simple backbone. Therefore, we use – for the first time at this scale – differentiable hydrologic models (full name δHBV-globe1.0-hydroDL, shortened to δHBV here) to simulate the rainfall–runoff processes for 3753 basins around the world. Moreover, we compare the δHBV models to a purely data-driven long short-term memory (LSTM) model to examine their strengths and limitations. Both LSTM and the δHBV models provide competitive daily hydrologic simulation capabilities in global basins, with median Kling–Gupta efficiency values close to or higher than 0.7 (and 0.78 with LSTM for a subset of 1675 basins with long-term discharge records), significantly outperforming traditional models. Moreover, regionalized differentiable models demonstrated stronger spatial generalization ability (median KGE 0.64) than a traditional parameter regionalization approach (median KGE 0.46) and even LSTM for ungauged region tests across continents. Nevertheless, relative to LSTM, the differentiable model was hampered by structural deficiencies for cold or polar regions, highly arid regions, and basins with significant human impacts. This study also sets the benchmark for hydrologic estimates around the world and builds a foundation for improving global hydrologic simulations."

Herein, a three-dimensional ordered macroporous Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 supported Pt nanoparticle monolithic catalyst (Pt/OM CZO) was synthesized to investigate these effects. Our findings uncover the diverse effects of SO2: Upon SO2 treatment, the coupling between the S 3p and Pt 5d orbitals promotes the Pt–O–SO3 structure in situ formed on the catalyst surface. The propene (C3H6) molecule readily binds with the oxygen atom in Pt–O–SO3, resulting in the accumulation of acetone and carbon deposition, thereby hindering C3H6 oxidation. Conversely, a cleaved oxygen atom within the Pt–O–SO3 structure enhances propane (C3H8) adsorption and activates the C–H bond, facilitating C3H8 oxidation.

Although it has been widely acknowledged that the catalytic performance of platinum group metal catalysts was highly determined by their dispersion and coordination environment, the most reactive structures on Ru/CeO2 catalysts for VOCs oxidation are still ambiguous. In this work, starting from Ce-BTC (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) materials, atomically dispersed Ru catalysts and agglomerated Ru catalysts were successfully created via one-step hydrothermal method (Ru-CeO2-BTC) and conventional incipient wetness impregnation method (Ru/CeO2-BTC), respectively. In a typical model reaction of C3H6 oxidation, atomically dispersed Ruδ+ species with the formation of abundant Ru–O–Ce linkages on Ru-CeO2-BTC were found to perform much better than agglomerated RuOx species on Ru/CeO2-BTC. Further characterizations and mechanism study disclosed that Ru-CeO2-BTC catalyst with atomically dispersed Ru ions and more superior low temperature redox performance compared to Ru/CeO2-BTC could better facilitate the adsorption/activation of C3H6 and the decomposition/desorption of intermediates, thus exhibiting superior C3H6 oxidation activity.

However, information on the occurrence and fate of the highly toxic halogenated byproducts, which are produced by chlorination decolorization of the textile printing and dyeing wastewater, is very limited. In this study, the occurrence of six categories of halogenated byproducts (haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), N-nitrosamines (NAs), trihalomethanes, halogenated ketones, and halonitromethanes) was investigated along the full-scale treatment processes of textile printing and dyeing wastewater treatment plants. Furthermore, the ecological risk of the halogenated byproducts was evaluated. The results showed that the total concentration of halogenated byproducts increased significantly after chlorination. Large amounts of HAAs (average 122.1 μg/L), HANs (average 80.9 μg/L), THMs (average 48.3 μg/L), and NAs (average 2314.3 ng/L) were found in the chlorinated textile wastewater, and the results showed that the generations of HANs and NAs were positively correlated with the BIX and β/α index, indicating that the HANs and NAs might form from the microbial metabolites. In addition, HAAs and HANs exhibited high ecological risk quotients (>1), suggesting their high potential ecological risk. The results also demonstrated that most halogenated byproducts could be effectively removed by reverse osmosis treatment processes except NAs, with a lower removal rate of 18%.

Natural organic matter (NOM) is ubiquitous in aquatic environments and plays a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles. However, its impact on the dissemination of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes (eARGs) under sunlight exposure remains elusive. This study reveals that environmentally relevant levels of NOM (0.1–20 mg/L) can significantly enhance the natural transformation frequency of the model bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 by up to 7.6-fold under simulated sunlight. Similarly, this enhancement was consistently observed in natural water and wastewater systems. Further mechanism analysis revealed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NOM under sunlight irradiation, primarily singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals, play a crucial role in this process. These ROS induce intracellular oxidative stress and elevated cellular membrane permeability, thereby indirectly boosting ATP production and enhancing cell competence of extracellular DNA uptake and integration. Our findings highlight a previously underestimated role of natural factors in the dissemination of eARGs within aquatic ecosystems and deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between NOM, sunlight, and microbes in environmental water bodies. This underscores the importance of developing comprehensive strategies to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments."

Water quality risks include leaks of gas and salty fluids (brines) that are coproduced at wellpads. Identifying the cause of contamination is difficult, however, because UOG wells are often colocated with other contaminant sources. We investigated the world’s largest shale gas play with publicly accessible groundwater data (Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. with ∼29,000 analyses) and discovered that concentrations of brine-associated barium ([Ba]) and strontium ([Sr]) show small regional increases within 1 km of UOG development. Higher concentrations in groundwaters are associated with greater proximity to and density of UOG wells. Concentration increases are even larger when considering associations with the locations of (i) spill-related violations and (ii) some wastewater impoundments. These statistically significant relationships persist even after correcting for other natural and anthropogenic sources of salts. The most likely explanation is that UOG development slightly increases salt concentrations in regional groundwaters not because of fracking but because of the ubiquity of wastewater management issues. These results emphasize the need for stringent wastewater management practices across oil and gas operations."

Extracellular electron transfer (EET)-mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM)-coupled with humic substances reduction plays an important role in the reduction of methane emissions from wetlands, where magnetite is prevalent. However, little is known about the magnetite-mediated EET mechanisms in AOM-coupled humic substances reduction. This study shows that magnetite promotes the reduction of the AOM-coupled humic substances model compound, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS). 13CH4 labeling experiments further indicated that AOM-coupled AQDS reduction occurred, and acetate was an intermediate product of AOM. Moreover, 13CH313COONa labeling experiments showed that AOM-generated acetate can be continuously reduced to methane in a state of dynamic equilibrium. In the presence of magnetite, the EET capacity of the microbial community increased, and Methanosarcina played a key role in the AOM-coupled AQDS reduction. Pure culture experiments showed that Methanosarcina barkeri can independently perform AOM-coupled AQDS reduction and that magnetite increased its surface protein redox activity. The metatranscriptomic results indicated that magnetite increased the expression of membrane-bound proteins involved in energy metabolism and electron transfer in M. barkeri, thereby increasing the EET capacity.

Prior EAC studies of soils and soil constituents utilized different methods, reductants, and mediators, making cross-study comparison difficult. This study was conducted to quantify and compare the EACs of two soil constituents (hematite and Leonardite humic acid) and 12 soils of diverse composition, using chemical redox titration (CRT) with dithionite as the reductant and mediated electrochemical reduction (MER) with diquat as the mediator. The EACs of hematite and humic acid measured by CRT (EACCRT) and MER (EACMER) are similar and close to the theoretical/reported values. For soils, EACCRT and EACMER increased with iron and organic carbon (TOC) contents, suggesting iron and carbon were the main contributors to soil EAC. EACCRT > EACMER for all soils, and their difference (ΔEAC = EACCRT – EACMER) increased with TOC, presumably due to the longer contact time in CRT and thus more complete reduction of carbonaceous redox moieties. We propose an equation that relates EACCRT to EACMER (ΔEAC = 1796fTOC + 32) and another that predicts EACCRT from dithionite-reducible Fe and TOC (EACCRT = 2705 μmol e–/g C × fTOC + 17907 μmol e–/g Fe × fFedithionite-reducible).

This work investigated the impact of TCC on anaerobic sulfur transformation, especially toxic H2S production. Experimental findings revealed that TCC facilitated sulfur flow from the sludge solid phase to liquid phase, promoted sulfate reduction and sulfur-containing amino acid degradation, and largely improved anaerobic H2S production, i.e., 50–600 mg/kg total suspended solids (TSS) TCC increased the cumulative H2S yields by 24.76–478.12%. Although TCC can be partially biodegraded in anaerobic systems, the increase in H2S production can be mainly attributed to the effect of TCC rather than its degradation products. TCC was spontaneously adsorbed by protein-like substances contained in microbe extracellular polymers (EPSs), and the adsorbed TCC increased the direct electron transfer ability of EPSs, possibly due to the increase in the content of electroactive polymer protein in EPSs, the polarization of the amide group C═O bond, and the increase of the α-helical peptide dipole moment, which might be one important reason for promoting sulfur bioconversion processes. Microbial analysis showed that the presence of TCC enriched the organic substrate-degrading bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria and increased the abundances of functional genes encoding sulfate transport and dissimilatory sulfate reduction."

Traditional large‐scale sea ice dynamics models rely on phenomenological ice rheology to simulate ice movements. These models are efficient on large scales but struggle to depict smaller‐scale ice features. In our study, we use a new version of the HiDEM discrete element model software to examine the formation of drift and pack ice under various stress conditions. Our findings show that high‐resolution size distributions of ice floes are universal and multimodal, and that compression ridges form three distinct zones. Reproducing complex characteristics of this nature in a standard rheology model is challenging, suggesting that a combination of models may be necessary for more precise predictions of sea ice dynamics. We propose a potential hybrid algorithm that integrates these approaches."

This site is characterized by the presence of ophiolites with an outcrop of serpentinites. Serpentinite is characterized by high resistivity (∼0.5–10 kΩ m) and high chargeability (∼20–400 mV V−1) values. We collected two serpentinite core samples for spectral induced polarization measurements conducted in the frequency range 10 mHz–45 kHz, validating the field results. The high chargeability of serpentinite is associated with the production of magnetite during the fluid‐rock alteration, as indicated by the high magnetic susceptibility of the core samples (0.0340 SI). Using the laboratory measurements and the K‐means clustering technique, we successfully imaged the serpentinite facies and we were able to distinguish blocks of serpentinites embedded in the sedimentary cover.

Horton,Methodological Approaches for Measuring the Association Between Heat Exposure and Health Outcomes: A Comprehensive Global Scoping Review,"Objective: To synthesize the methodologies of studies that evaluate the impacts of heat exposure on morbidity and mortality. Methods: Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from date of inception until 1 March 2023 for English language literature on heat exposure and health outcomes. Records were collated, deduplicated and screened, and full texts were reviewed for inclusion and data abstraction. Eligibility for inclusion was determined as any article with climate‐related heat exposure and an associated morbidity/mortality outcome. Results: Of 13,136 records initially identified, 237 articles were selected for analysis. The scope of research represented 43 countries, with most studies conducted in China (62), the USA (44), and Australia (16). Across all studies, there were 141 unique climate data sources, no standard threshold for extreme heat, and 200 unique health outcome data sources. The distributed lag non‐linear model (DLNM) was the most common analytic method (48.1% of studies) and had high usage rates in China (68.9%) and the USA (31.8%); Australia frequently used conditional logistic regression (50%). Conditional logistic regression was most prevalent in case‐control studies (5 of 8 studies, 62.5%) and in case‐crossover studies (29 of 70, 41.4%). DLNMs were most common in time series studies (64 of 111, 57.7%) and ecological studies (13 of 20, 65.0%). Conclusions: This review underscores the heterogeneity of methods in heat impact studies across diverse settings and provides a resource for future researchers.

 One issue that always strands the scaling-up development of perovskite photovoltaics is the significant efficiency drop when enlarging the device area, which is caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of defected sites1-3. In the narrow band gap formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), the native impurities of PbI2 and δ-FAPbI3 non-perovskite could induce unfavored non-radiative recombination, as well as inferior charge transport and extraction 4,5.Here, we develop an impurity-healing interface engineering strategy to well address the issue both in small-area solar cell and large-scale submodule. With the introduction of a functional cation, 2-(1-cyclohexenyl)ethyl ammonium, two-dimensional (2D) perovskite with high mobility is rationally constructed on FAPbI3 to horizontally cover the film surface and vertically penetrate to the grain boundaries of 3D perovskites. Such unique configuration not only comprehensively transforms the PbI2 and δ-FAPbI3 impurities into stable 2D perovskite and realize a uniform defect passivation, but also provides interconnecting channels for efficient carrier transport. As a result, the FAPbI3-based small-area (0.085 cm2) solar cells achieve a champion efficiency over 25.86% with a notably high fill factor (FF) of 86.16%. More encouragingly, the fabricated submodules with the aperture area of 715.1 cm2 obtain a certified record efficiency of 22.46% with a good FF of 81.21%, showcasing the feasibility and effectualness of the impurity-healing interface engineering for scaling-up promotion with well-preserved photovoltaic performance."

 Cognitive deficits are long-lasting consequences of drug use, yet the convergent mechanism by which classes of drugs with different pharmacological properties cause similar deficits is unclear. We find that both phencyclidine and methamphetamine, despite differing in their targets in the brain, cause the same glutamatergic neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of male mice to gain a GABAergic phenotype and decrease expression of their glutamatergic phenotype. Suppressing drug-induced gain of GABA with RNA-interference prevents appearance of memory deficits. Stimulation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area is necessary and sufficient to produce this gain of GABA. Drug-induced prefrontal hyperactivity drives this change in transmitter identity. Returning prefrontal activity to baseline, chemogenetically or with clozapine, reverses the change in transmitter phenotype and rescues the associated memory deficits. This work reveals a shared and reversible mechanism that regulates the appearance of cognitive deficits upon exposure to different drugs.

 Marine heatwaves (MHWs) and total heat exposures (THEs), extreme warming events occurring across the global oceans, seriously threaten marine ecosystems and coastal communities as the climate warms. However, future changes in MHWs and THEs in the Arctic Ocean, where unique marine ecosystems are present, are still unclear. Here, based on the latest CMIP6 climate simulations, we find that both MHWs and THEs in the Arctic Ocean are anticipated to intensify in a warming climate, mainly due to Arctic sea ice decline and long-term warming trend, respectively. Particularly striking is the projected rise in MHW mean intensity during the 21st century in the Arctic Ocean, surpassing the global average by more than sevenfold under the CMIP6 SSP585 scenario. This phenomenon, coined the ‘Arctic MHW Amplification’, underscores an impending and disproportionately elevated threat to the Arctic marine life, necessitating targeted conservation and adaptive strategies.

 The human microbiome emerges as a promising reservoir for diagnostic markers and therapeutics. Since host-associated microbiomes at various body sites differ and diseases do not occur in isolation, a comprehensive analysis strategy highlighting the full potential of microbiomes should include diverse specimen types and various diseases. To ensure robust data quality and comparability across specimen types and diseases, we employ standardized protocols to generate sequencing data from 1931 prospectively collected specimens, including from saliva, plaque, skin, throat, eye, and stool, with an average sequencing depth of 5.3 gigabases. Collected from 515 patients, these samples yield an average of 3.7 metagenomes per patient. Our results suggest significant microbial variations across diseases and specimen types, including unexpected anatomical sites. We identify 583 unexplored species-level genome bins (SGBs) of which 189 are significantly disease-associated. Of note, the existence of microbial resistance genes in one specimen was indicative of the same resistance genes in other specimens of the same patient. Annotated and previously undescribed SGBs collectively harbor 28,315 potential biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), with 1050 significant correlations to diseases. Our combinatorial approach identifies distinct SGBs and BGCs, emphasizing the value of pan-body pan-disease microbiomics as a source for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Here the authors raise nanobodies to human gasdermin and characterize the pore formation process mediated by GSDMD and how antagonistic nanobodies prevent pyroptosis. 
 Inflammasome activation results in the cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) by pro-inflammatory caspases. The N-terminal domains (GSDMDNT) oligomerize and assemble pores penetrating the target membrane. As methods to study pore formation in living cells are insufficient, the order of conformational changes, oligomerization, and membrane insertion remained unclear. We have raised nanobodies (VHHs) against human GSDMD and find that cytosolic expression of VHHGSDMD-1 and VHHGSDMD-2 prevents oligomerization of GSDMDNT and pyroptosis. The nanobody-stabilized GSDMDNT monomers partition into the plasma membrane, suggesting that membrane insertion precedes oligomerization. Inhibition of GSDMD pore formation switches cell death from pyroptosis to apoptosis, likely driven by the enhanced caspase-1 activity required to activate caspase-3. Recombinant antagonistic nanobodies added to the extracellular space prevent pyroptosis and exhibit unexpected therapeutic potential. They may thus be suitable to treat the ever-growing list of diseases caused by activation of (non-) canonical inflammasomes.

Krull;Syed Azmal Ali;Jeroen Krijgsveld,Enhanced feature matching in single-cell proteomics characterizes IFN-γ response and co-existence of cell states,"Single-cell proteomics needs improved workflows for reliable proteome characterization in minute samples. Here, the authors demonstrate that matching data to a higher-input sample faithfully improves proteome coverage to examine proteome response and heterogeneity in single-cell populations. 
 Proteome analysis by data-independent acquisition (DIA) has become a powerful approach to obtain deep proteome coverage, and has gained recent traction for label-free analysis of single cells. However, optimal experimental design for DIA-based single-cell proteomics has not been fully explored, and performance metrics of subsequent data analysis tools remain to be evaluated. Therefore, we here formalize and comprehensively evaluate a DIA data analysis strategy that exploits the co-analysis of low-input samples with a so-called matching enhancer (ME) of higher input, to increase sensitivity, proteome coverage, and data completeness. We assess the matching specificity of DIA-ME by a two-proteome model, and demonstrate that false discovery and false transfer are maintained at low levels when using DIA-NN software, while preserving quantification accuracy. We apply DIA-ME to investigate the proteome response of U-2 OS cells to interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in single cells, and recapitulate the time-resolved induction of IFN-γ response proteins as observed in bulk material. Moreover, we uncover co- and anti-correlating patterns of protein expression within the same cell, indicating mutually exclusive protein modules and the co-existence of different cell states. Collectively our data show that DIA-ME is a powerful, scalable, and easy-to-implement strategy for single-cell proteomics. Single-cell proteomics needs improved workflows for reliable proteome characterization in minute samples.

 Understanding human, animal, and environmental microbiota is essential for advancing global health and combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We investigate the oral and gut microbiota of 48 animal species in captivity, comparing them to those of wildlife animals. Specifically, we characterize the microbiota composition, metabolic pathways, AMR genes, and biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the production of specialized metabolites. Our results reveal a high diversity of microbiota, with 585 novel species-level genome bins (SGBs) and 484 complete BGCs identified. Functional gene analysis of microbiomes shows diet-dependent variations. Furthermore, by comparing our findings to wildlife-derived microbiomes, we observe the impact of captivity on the animal microbiome, including examples of converging microbiome compositions. Importantly, our study identifies AMR genes against commonly used veterinary antibiotics, as well as resistance to vancomycin, a critical antibiotic in human medicine. These findings underscore the importance of the ‘One Health’ approach and the potential for zoonotic transmission of pathogenic bacteria and AMR. Overall, our study contributes to a better understanding of the complexity of the animal microbiome and highlights its BGC diversity relevant to the discovery of novel antimicrobial compounds.

 The approval of splice-switching oligonucleotides with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has advanced the field of oligonucleotide therapy. Despite this progress, PMOs encounter challenges such as poor tissue uptake, particularly in the heart, diaphragm, and central nervous system (CNS), thereby affecting patient’s prognosis and quality of life. To address these limitations, we have developed a PMOs-based heteroduplex oligonucleotide (HDO) technology. This innovation involves a lipid-ligand-conjugated complementary strand hybridized with PMOs, significantly enhancing delivery to key tissues in mdx mice, normalizing motor functions, muscle pathology, and serum creatine kinase by restoring internal deleted dystrophin expression. Additionally, PMOs-based HDOs normalized cardiac and CNS abnormalities without adverse effects. Our technology increases serum albumin binding to PMOs and improves blood retention and cellular uptake. Here we show that PMOs-based HDOs address the limitations in oligonucleotide therapy for DMD and offer a promising approach for diseases amenable to exon-skipping therapy. Here, the authors develop a PMO-based heteroduplex oligonucleotide technology that enhances PMO delivery to tissues and normalizes motor/cardiac function and CNS symptoms in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

 Individuals with mental illness are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, previous studies on the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in this population have reported conflicting results. Using data from seven cohort studies (N = 325,298) included in the multinational COVIDMENT consortium, and the Swedish registers (N = 8,080,234), this study investigates the association between mental illness (defined using self-report measures, clinical diagnosis and prescription data) and COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Results from the COVIDMENT cohort studies were pooled using meta-analyses, the majority of which showed no significant association between mental illness and vaccination uptake. In the Swedish register study population, we observed a very small reduction in the uptake of both the first and second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine among individuals with vs. without mental illness; the reduction was however greater among those not using psychiatric medication. Here we show that uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is generally high among individuals both with and without mental illness, however the lower levels of vaccination uptake observed among subgroups of individuals with unmedicated mental illness warrants further attention. Monitoring COVID-19 vaccine uptake in those at risk of severe disease, such as people with mental illness, is important.

 The rapid increase in Urban Construction Sites (UCSs) due to urbanization has become a global trend. UCSs are crucial for timely tracking of urban expansion and renewal progress, understanding settlement environments and human activities, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 11. However, distinguishing UCSs from other land covers remains challenging, whether using spatial texture and spectral features or time-series characteristics. There is an urgent need for a universally applicable UCS mapping method at the national scale, a gap that current research has yet to fill. In this study, we proposed a method combining geospatial data with remote sensing data for national UCS mapping under medium spatial resolution. Additionally, we combine the UCS mapping results with SDGSAT-1 GLI data to evaluate the utilization status of new construction areas, thereby supporting SDG 11.3. The results showed that, for six representative cities, the F1-Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC) for exposed UCS mapping results ranged from 98.83 % to 99.49 % and from 0.64 to 0.77, respectively. Variable importance detected in the Random Forest (RF) model highlighted that the key to identifying UCSs lay in geospatial information describing UCS spatial distribution, including distance to roads, city boundaries, and dust-proof nets. The assessment of the utilization status for new construction areas highlights the differences in the utilization status with which cities at various stages of development utilize these new areas. We then compared the ability of UCS distribution with existing impervious surface products in reflecting the dynamics of urban construction. The results showed that UCS spatial distribution could reflect urban construction patterns more timely and accurately, providing key insights for urban planners. Overall, this study provides a universal methodology that can be referenced for mapping land covers that have low separability in spectral and textural features in complex urban environments. The proposed method offers a cost-effective and reliable way to map nationwide UCS distribution, providing clear and timely spatial information for urban planning and achieving SDGs."

We explored a causal relationship between cellular synaptic strength and electroencephalography delta power indicating macro-level sleep pressure by developing a theoretical framework and a molecular tool to manipulate synaptic strength. The mathematical model predicted that increased synaptic strength promotes the neuronal “down state” and raises the delta power. Our molecular tool (synapse-targeted chemically induced translocation of Kalirin-7, SYNCit-K), which induces dendritic spine enlargement and synaptic potentiation through chemically induced translocation of protein Kalirin-7, demonstrated that synaptic potentiation of excitatory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) increases nonrapid eye movement sleep amounts and delta power.

Using live-cell microscopy, we find that metaphase chromosomes are spatially anti-correlated in mouse oocyte spindles, evidence of previously unknown long-range forces acting perpendicular to the spindle axis.

 The critical zone (CZ) is the Earth's skin where rock, water, air, and life interact – playing a pivotal role in sustaining ecological processes and life-supporting resources. Understanding these interactions, especially in forested headwater catchments, is key for managing water resources, predicting environmental responses, and assessing human impacts. We present a novel dataset from the Weierbach Experimental Catchment in Luxembourg, derived from a year-long high-frequency monitoring campaign that focused on groundwater physico-chemical parameters. Through meticulous data collection and rigorous quality control, parameters such as electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, and pH were measured, offering new insights into the CZ's hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics. The dataset highlights the intricate interplay between redox reactions, pH, and ion exchange processes, as well as the influence of seasonal variability and flowline interactions on solute transport. By providing a detailed view of the catchment's response to hydrological changes, this dataset fills a significant gap in CZ research, offering a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of hydro-biogeochemical catchment processes.

Simulations highlight changes in graupel distribution and precipitation patterns, potentially influencing surface snow amounts. The study underscores the significance of integrating predicted graupel density for a more realistic portrayal of microphysical properties in weather models. 
 The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) double-moment 6-class (WDM6) scheme was modified by incorporating predicted graupel density. Explicitly predicted graupel density, in turn, modifies graupel characteristics such as the fall velocity–diameter and mass–diameter relationships of graupel. The modified WDM6 has been evaluated based on a two-dimensional (2D) idealized squall line simulation and winter snowfall events that occurred during the International Collaborative Experiment for Pyeongchang Olympics and Paralympics (ICE-POP 2018) field campaign over the Korean Peninsula. From the 2D simulation, we confirmed that the modified WDM6 can simulate varying graupel densities, ranging from low values in an anvil cloud region to high values in the convective region at the mature stage of a squall line. Simulations with the modified WDM6 increased graupel amounts at the surface and decreased graupel aloft because of the faster sedimentation of graupel for two winter snowfall cases during the ICE-POP 2018 campaign, as simulated in the 2D idealized model. The altered graupel sedimentation in the modified WDM6 influenced the magnitude of the major microphysical processes of graupel and snow, subsequently reducing the surface snow amount and precipitation over the mountainous region. The reduced surface precipitation over the mountainous region mitigates the surface precipitation bias observed in the original WDM6, resulting in better statistical skill scores for the root mean square errors. Notably, the modified WDM6 reasonably captures the relationship between graupel density and its fall velocity, as retrieved from 2D video disdrometer measurements, thus emphasizing the necessity of including predicted graupel density to realistically represent the microphysical properties of graupel in models."

Here, we uncover the impact of six metal ions (i.e., Ca2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Al3+, and Sc3+) presenting in water environments on Mn(VII) activity. These ions uniformly boost the electron and oxygen transfer capabilities of Mn(VII) while impeding proton transfer, as evidenced by electrochemical tests, thioanisole probe analysis, and the kinetic isotope effect. The observed effects are intricately linked to the Lewis acidity of the metal ions. Further mechanistic insights reveal that Mn(VII) can interact with metal ions without direct reduction. Such interactions modify the electronic configuration of Mn(VII) and create an acidic microenvironment, thus increasing its electrophilicity and the energy barrier for the abstraction of proton from organic substrates. More importantly, the efficacy of Mn(VII) in removing phenolic pollutants is regulated by these ions through changing the driving force for proton and electron transfer, i.e., facilitated at pH > 4.5 and inhibited at lower pH. The contribution of active Mn intermediates is also discussed to reveal the oxidative mechanism of the metal ion/Mn(VII) system. These findings not only facilitate the rational design of Mn(VII) oxidation conditions in the presence of metal ions for water decontamination but also offer an alternative paradigm for enhancing electrophilic oxidation."

When reduced humin encounters O2, the possibility of ·OH formation arises. However, the exploration of ·OH generation mediated by humin has not been comprehensively conducted. The study found that  O2 oxidized the reduced humin, generating 8.61 μmol/g of ·OH. After isolating humin using the methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) method, the lipid component was identified as the primary contributor to ·OH generation. Subsequent polar separation revealed that the lipid fraction extracted from the ethanol–water mixture with a volume ratio of 7:3 (LFEW7:3) played the most significant role in ·OH production. Further characterization confirmed that the simultaneous presence of aromatic C═C and C═O were the predominant features contributing to the ·OH generation. The ·OH generation experiments with humin-pyridine analogue compound demonstrated that polycyclic pyridine N (≥3 rings) played a significant role in promoting the ·OH generation. Most importantly, the study compared the ·OH production by humin and homologous humic acid, indicating that ·OH generated by humin was higher than that of humic acid. Overall, these affirmative findings manifested the overlooked role of humin in ·OH production and offered valuable insights into the mechanism of ·OH generation by humin in the dark."

Here we show for two representative soils in Alaska (initially Ca-poor or Ca-rich) that this increase in Ca availability will lead to decreases in CO2 release by 50% and 57%.

Here we show that the decrease of the soil CO2 release may be also due to enhanced aragonite formation (by 300% for Ca-poor and 90–200% for Ca-rich soils), as revealed by synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. We therefore call upon field experiments for validation of this process and inclusion of this process in global and local carbon budget models."

However, their environmental occurrence, levels, and risks have until now remained unexplored. To address this gap, this study screened, identified, and prioritized six CTPs in dust samples from various urban environments, including e-waste recycling plants, residential households, underground parking lots, and outdoor roads. Notably, all six CTPs were detected in the samples, with hexaphenoxycyclotriphosphazene (HPCTP) being identified as the most predominant congener. The total concentrations of six CTPs in dust from e-waste recycling plants ranged from 24.0 to 1790 ng/g (median of 150 ng/g), which were significantly higher than those from residential houses (median of 50.5 ng/g) and other urban environments. Different composition profiles of CTPs were observed between indoor and outdoor environments, indicating that multiple sources or variations in environmental behaviors influenced contamination levels. Exposure assessments revealed that e-waste recycling workers ingested more CTPs than did the general population. Among the newly identified CTPs, HPCTP emerged as a significant pollutant owing to its abundance, ubiquity, persistence, mobility, and toxicity. Overall, this study is the first to report the occurrence of CTPs in the environment. Our findings point to the emerging concern regarding CTPs as extensively used yet insufficiently evaluated chemicals."

 Seismic waves traversing the inner core in a direction parallel to Earth’s rotation axis arrive faster than waves travelling in the equatorial plane. These observations have been explained in terms of a transversely isotropic inner-core model with a fast symmetry axis parallel to the rotation axis. In recent years, more complex models of the inner core have been developed containing strong regional variations such as hemispheres, isotropic layers and an innermost inner core, most of which assume spatially variable transverse isotropy with a fixed symmetry axis. Here we instead explain the travel times of inner-core-sensitive seismic waves in terms of tilted transverse isotropy, in which the magnitude of transverse isotropy is fixed, but the orientation of the symmetry axis is allowed to vary spatially. This model, derived from seismic tomography, fits travel time data and spatially variable fixed-axis models, yet requires fewer parameters. It features a central inner core with a strong alignment of the fast symmetry axis in the direction of Earth’s spin axis and two shallow caps beneath the Mid-Atlantic and the Indian Ocean/Indonesia regions with symmetry axes tilted towards the equatorial plane. This model indicates the potential for varying crystal orientations within the inner core, which would constrain inner-core dynamics.

 Cryptic fungal pathogens pose disease management challenges due to their morphological resemblance to known pathogens.

 The aqueous interface-rich system has been proposed to act as a trigger and a reservoir for reactive radicals, playing a crucial role in chemical reactions. Although much is known about the redox reactivity of water microdroplets at “droplets-in-gas” interfaces, it remains poorly understood for “bubbles-in-water” interfaces that are created by feeding gas through the porous membrane of the gas diffusion electrode. Here we reveal the spontaneous generation of highly reactive redox radical species detected by using electron paramagnetic resonance under such conditions without applying any bias and loading any catalysts. In combination with ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, the redox feature has been further verified through several probe molecules. Unexpectedly, introducing crown ether allows to isolate and stabilize both water radical cations and hydrated electrons thus substantially increasing redox reactivity. Our finding suggests a reactive microenvironment at the interface of the gas diffusion electrode owing to the coexistence of oxidative and reductive species.

This study shows that two-colour noncollinear wave mixing in silica significantly enhances HHG efficiency over single-color methods, offering a novel pathway for advancing all-solid XUV sources. 
 The emission of high-order harmonics from solids under intense laser-pulse irradiation is revolutionizing our understanding of strong-field solid-light interactions, while simultaneously opening avenues towards novel, all-solid, coherent, short-wavelength table-top sources with tailored emission profiles and nanoscale light-field control. To date, broadband spectra in solids have been generated well into the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV), but the comparatively low conversion efficiency in the XUV range achieved under optimal conditions still lags behind gas-based high-harmonic generation (HHG) sources. Here, we demonstrate that two-color high-order harmonic wave mixing in a fused silica solid is more efficient than solid HHG driven by a single color. This finding has significant implications for compact XUV sources where gas-based HHG is not feasible, as solid XUV wave mixing surpasses solid-HHG in performance. Moreover, our results enable utilizing solid high-order harmonic wave mixing as a probe of structure or material dynamics of the generating solid, which will enable reducing measurement times compared to the less efficient regular solid HHG. The emission intensity scaling that follows perturbative optical wave mixing, combined with the angular separation of the emitted frequencies, makes our approach a decisive step for all-solid coherent XUV sources and for studying light-engineered materials. High-order harmonic generation in solids could develop into a compact, coherent, short-wavelength source.

 Enzymes are making a significant impact on chemical synthesis. However, the range of chemical products achievable through biocatalysis is still limited compared to the vast array of products possible with organic synthesis. For instance, azoxy products have rarely been synthesized using enzyme catalysts. In this study, we discovered that fungal unspecific peroxygenases are promising catalysts for synthesizing azoxy products from simple aniline starting materials. The catalytic features (up to 48,450 turnovers and a turnover frequency of 6.7 s–1) and substrate transformations (up to 99% conversion with 98% chemoselectivity) highlight the synthetic potential. We propose a mechanism where peroxygenase-derived hydroxylamine and nitroso compounds spontaneously (non-enzymatically) form the desired azoxy products.

 Azimuth or along-track (approximately north-south) motion is critical in constructing three-dimensional ground motion with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites orbiting the Earth in sun-synchronous polar orbit. The main problem of measuring azimuth motion with short-wavelength SAR data is decorrelation. A fleet of newly launched and upcoming long-wavelength L-band SAR satellites bring new opportunities for measuring azimuth motion. However, azimuth motion measured with L-band SAR data often contains large azimuth shifts caused by the Earth's ionosphere. We outline the framework of separating the azimuth motion and ionospheric azimuth shift from an analysis of the ionospheric effects on SAR images and SAR measurement precisions. We demonstrate three methods, among which one is newly proposed, can separate the azimuth motion and ionospheric azimuth shift with higher precisions. We evaluate the performances of the three methods by simulations using parameters of several selected L-band SAR satellites. The results show that, at kilometer resolutions, the azimuth motion measured by multiple-aperture SAR interferometry (MAI) can achieve centimeter precision, while the ionospheric azimuth shifts can be estimated with decimeter precision. Based on these results, a strategy for obtaining corrected azimuth motion is subsequently suggested, which achieves at least a first-order ionospheric correction of the original higher resolution MAI result. The three methods were also compared by real data processing examples. Furthermore, using real and simulated data of selected L-band SAR satellites, we present the first L-band MAI time series analysis result that measures subtle ground motion, as illustrated by the example of the postseismic deformation after the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes in Japan. The performance is expected to be further improved with future L-band SAR missions that have much higher duty cycles. Some geophysical applications, in particular, those associated with the Earth's tectonic processes, can thus benefit from the azimuth motion measured by L-band SAR data."

 In situ samples are essential for crop mapping, but the collection of samples is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the samples are usually only valid for the current year, due to the crop rotation across years. In this paper, we discuss an alternative solution, i.e., whether using transfer learning to mine useful information from historical products can achieve cross-year crop mapping without the need for in situ samples. However, there are two main challenges that limit the application of historical products: 1) the label mismatch problem, which is caused by the limited accuracy of the historical products and the cross-year changes in crop planting; and 2) the cross-year phenological mismatch problem, where the number and the date of the satellite imagery time series (SITS) are inconsistent across years, hindering the transferability of deep learning models. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end CRoss-year crOp maP UPdating (CROPUP) framework for crop mapping without the need for any in situ samples. Specifically, to solve the cross-year phenological mismatch problem, an UNequal tIme-series feaTure Extraction (UNITE) network is first introduced to unify the feature dimensions of the SITS of different years, which is then followed by a feature alignment module to align the key cross-year phenological features. In addition, to solve the label mismatch problem, the CROPUP framework introduces a noise-free label estimation loss to reduce the noisy labels in the historical products dynamically during training, which promotes the accuracy of cross-year crop mapping in an iterative manner. The CROPUP framework was verified in the Corn Belt in the U.S. for a long-term and multi-scene analysis and in Jianghan Plain in China for a large-area analysis, using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 SITS. The CROPUP framework is highly efficient, and still robust in the case of historical products with a high noisy label ratio. It also shows strength in early-season crop mapping. In addition, the experiments undertaken in this study indicated that the validity period for historical products is within about 5 years, and the accuracy decreases with an increase in time interval. We believe that the CROPUP framework will be a promising and efficient tool to support large-scale crop map updating without the need for in situ samples."

 Information on the sowing areas and yields of crops is important for ensuring food security and reforming the agricultural modernization process, while crop classification and identification are core issues when attempting to acquire information on crop planting areas and yields. Obtaining information on crop planting areas and yields in a timely and accurate manner is highly important for optimizing crop planting structures, formulating agricultural policies, and ensuring national economic development. In this paper, a fine crop classification model based on multitemporal Sentinel-2 images, CTANet, is proposed. It comprises a convolutional attention architecture (CAA) and a temporal attention architecture (TAA), incorporating spatial attention modules, channel attention modules and temporal attention modules. These modules adaptively weight each pixel, channel and temporal phase of the given feature map to mitigate the intraclass spatial heterogeneity, spectral variability and temporal variability of crops. Additionally, the auxiliary features of significant importance for each crop category are identified using the random forest-SHAP algorithm, enabling the construction of classification datasets containing spectral bands, spectral bands with auxiliary features, and spectral bands with optimized auxiliary features. Evaluations conducted on three crop classification datasets revealed that the proposed CTANet approach and its key CANet component demonstrated superior crop classification performance on the classification dataset consisting of spectral bands and optimized auxiliary features in comparisons with the other tested models. Based on this dataset, CTANet achieved higher validation accuracy and lower validation loss than those of the other methods, and during testing, it attained the highest overall accuracy (93.9 %) and MIoU (87.5 %). When identifying rice, maize, and soybeans, the F1 scores of CTANet reached 95.6 %, 95.7 %, and 94.7 %, and the IoU scores were 91.6 %, 91.7 %, and 89.9 %, respectively, significantly exceeding those of some commonly used deep learning models. This indicates the potential of the proposed method for distinguishing between different crop types."

 As the network structures continue to innovate and evolve, significant achievements have been achieved in hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, how to further explore the spectral domain potential from prior knowledge and channel-enhanced structures to achieve better performance has inspired the following two works: Firstly, to systematically compare prior knowledge of spectral with spatial domain for HSI-SR tasks, four transfer learning strategies are proposed. The superior performance of the Relevant Channel/Random Space (RCRS) strategy reveals the importance of spectral feature reconstruction in HSI-SR tasks. Meanwhile, an interesting phenomenon has been observed that even without training on real datasets, the model can already exhibit a core or even decent super-resolution capability based solely on prior knowledge of above four strategies. Secondly, a dual-branch channel network with complementary channel feature extraction (CCFE) and adjacent channel feature extraction (ACFE) module is designed for spectral feature enhancement, which demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on six datasets. To conclude, the effectiveness of RCRS strategy with pseudo prior channel knowledge on seven dual-input and eight single-input networks, as well as superiority of the proposed channel-enhanced network indicate the importance of spectral properties for HSI-SR tasks."

 Improving the accuracy of nearshore bathymetric measurements is essential for understanding coastal environments, resource management, and navigation. The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) is the first laser satellite that uses the photon-counting technique. The ICESat-2 is equipped with the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), which enables higher-accuracy measurements of water, ice, and land elevation on Earth. Two-media photogrammetric bathymetry is a type of nearshore bathymetric technology that uses the geometrical characteristics of light rays. With this technique, the accuracy and reliability mainly depend on eliminating systematic errors and ensuring accurate spatial photogrammetric positioning relative to the object being measured. To improve the bathymetric accuracy of two-media photogrammetry, we integrated high-accuracy elevation data from photon datasets as constraining and control parameters. The improved method effectively eliminated systematic errors in two-media photogrammetry during the established joint-block adjustment model. To improve its accuracy and reliability, we employed multispectral WorldView-2 stereo images in our experiments. Furthermore, the bathymetric results were validated and assessed using in situ and photon data. The experimental results show that the highest accuracy achieved with the bathymetric measurements in our study area was a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.96 m and a mean absolute error of 0.57 m. Using the proposed fusion method, the bathymetric accuracy (as measured using the RMSE) was 1 m higher than that of two-media photogrammetry without the photon datasets."

 The molybdenum (Mo) isotope budget of the surface environment has been well characterized in recent decades, facilitating accurate mass balance modeling of the ancient redox-driven Mo cycle. One yet unresolved component is the range of possible processes and sources that result in isotopically heavy river waters relative to continental sources. Following a recent hypothesis that isotopically heavy δ98Mo of precipitation may control the final δ98Mo of river water relative to its continental source bedrock, we investigated the δ98Mo composition of 19 snow samples from three locations in Central Europe: the Swiss Alps (“Alpine” samples) from the Hochalpine Forschungsstation Jungfraujoch (HFSJ) in both summer and winter, the Swiss Jura Mountains in winter and the French Vosges Mountains in winter. Stream waters from two snowmelt-fed streams were additionally collected from the Alpine site. Snow sample δ98Mo compositions were highly variable, ranging from −0.03 to +1.93 ‰, with no clear mixing trends indicating complex sources, source pathways, or post-depositional processing. Only the winter snow samples from the high-altitude HFSJ site had δ98Mo values consistently heavier than typical continental crust. The δ98Mo results were coupled with radiogenic Sr isotopic, major ion, and trace element compositions as tracers for three major sources of airborne ion inputs: sea salt, mineral dust, and anthropogenic aerosols. We found that the most likely source of Mo to precipitation in the lower elevation Vosges and Jura Mountains samples was isotopically light soil mineral dust, which reflected the underlying bedrock sources, with a likely additional anthropogenic component. The isotopically heavy winter snow samples at the elevated HFSJ site were attributed to a higher input of carbonate mineral dust from long-distance transport of carbonate-rich Saharan dust, which was overwritten in the summer by an influx of low elevation sources transported upwards during higher vertical thermal mixing. Finally, we concluded that precipitation has a negligible direct effect on the overall Mo content and isotopic composition of inner continental European streams and rivers relative to other sources, such as bedrock weathering. Future time-series studies may augment these conclusions to show possible heterogeneity of precipitation as well as the addition of sample sites closer to marine sources, where a larger flux of isotopically heavy marine aerosols to streams might be expected."

High concentrations of lithium in brines have been observed in the Smackover Formation in southern Arkansas (>400 milligrams per liter). We used published and newly collected brine lithium concentration data to train a random forest machine-learning model using geologic, geochemical, and temperature explanatory variables and create a map of predicted lithium concentrations in Smackover Formation brines across southern Arkansas. Using these predicted lithium maps with reservoir parameters and geologic information, we calculated that there are 5.1 to 19 million tons of lithium in Smackover Formation brines in southern Arkansas, which represents 35 to 136% of the current US lithium resource estimate. Based on these calculations, in 2022, 5000 tons of dissolved lithium were brought to the surface within brines as waste streams of the oil, gas, and bromine industries."

We show that, like for Fe, Ryugu and CI chondrites also have indistinguishable Ni isotope anomalies, which differ from those of other carbonaceous chondrites. We propose that this unique Fe and Ni isotopic composition reflects different accretion efficiencies of small FeNi metal grains among the carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies. The CI chondrites incorporated these grains more efficiently, possibly because they formed at the end of the disk’s lifetime, when planetesimal formation was also triggered by photoevaporation of the disk. Isotopic variations among carbonaceous chondrites may thus reflect fractionation of distinct dust components from a common reservoir, implying CI chondrites/Ryugu may have formed in the same region of the accretion disk as other carbonaceous chondrites."

Here, we show that the quantitative control of the core clock proteins TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 [TOC1; also known as PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 1 (PRR1)] and PRR5 is crucial for temperature compensation inArabidopsis thaliana. Theprr5 toc1double mutant has a shortened period at higher temperatures, resulting in weak temperature compensation. Low ambient temperature reduces amounts of PRR5 and TOC1. In low-temperature conditions, PRR5 and TOC1 interact with LOV KELCH PROTEIN 2 (LKP2), a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF) complex. Thelkp2mutations attenuate low temperature–induced decrease of PRR5 and TOC1, and the mutants display longer period only at lower temperatures. Our findings reveal that the circadian clock maintains its period length despite ambient temperature fluctuations through temperature- andLKP2-dependent control of PRR5 and TOC1 abundance."

However, the research on whether the film optimization fully contributes to the enhancement of the final PSCs has been long neglected. We demonstrated that the preparation of metal electrodes by high-vacuum thermal evaporation, an unavoidable step in almost all device fabrication processes, will damage the surface of perovskite films, resulting in component escape, defect density rebound, carrier extraction barrier, and film stability deterioration. Therefore, the prepared perovskite film and the final film actually working in devices are not exactly the same, and the contribution of film optimization to the device improvement was weakened. We designed a bilayer structure composed of graphene oxide and graphite flakes to eliminate the unwanted film inconsistencies and thus save the film optimization loss. Therefore, the efficient PSCs with power conversion efficiency of 25.55% were obtained, which demonstrated negligible photovoltaic performance loss after operating for 2000 hours."

We investigated longitudinally (up to five time points) a cohort of 234 vaccinated >65-year-old vaccinees with adjuvanted vaccine FluAd across two independent seasons. System-level analyses of multiomics datasets measuring six modalities and serological data revealed that poor responders lacked time-dependent changes in response to vaccination as observed in responders, suggestive of systemic dysregulation in poor responders. Multiomics integration revealed key molecules and their likely role in vaccination response. High prevaccination plasma interleukin-15 (IL-15) concentrations negatively associated with antibody production, further supported by experimental validation in mice revealing an IL-15–driven natural killer cell axis explaining the suppressive role in vaccine-induced antibody production as observed in poor responders. We propose a subset of long-chain fatty acids as modulators of persistent inflammation in poor responders. Our findings provide a potential link between low-grade chronic inflammation and poor vaccination response and open avenues for possible pharmacological interventions to enhance vaccine responses."

Here, we show that inhibition of ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (ATR), the primary replication stress response activator, induces DNA damage–mediated micronuclei formation in SCLC models. ATR inhibition in SCLC activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)–mediated interferon signaling, recruits T cells, and augments the antitumor immune response of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade in mouse models. We demonstrate that combined ATR and PD-L1 inhibition causes improved antitumor response than PD-L1 alone as the second-line treatment in SCLC. This study shows that targeting ATR up-regulates major histocompatibility class I expression in preclinical models and SCLC clinical samples collected from a first-in-class clinical trial of ATR inhibitor, berzosertib, with topotecan in patients with relapsed SCLC. Targeting ATR represents a transformative vulnerability of SCLC and is a complementary strategy to induce STING-interferon signaling–mediated immunogenicity in SCLC."

However, pregnancy-related respiratory immune adaptations in response to influenza infection and their impact on disease severity remain unclear. Here, we describe, in a preclinical model of mid-gestation pregnancy, a mechanism of enhanced host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) localized to the nasal cavity that limits viral replication and reduces the magnitude of intrapulmonary immune responses. Consequently, the pregnant mice show reduced pulmonary pathology and preserved airway function after IAV infection. The early restriction of viral replication is independent of type I interferon (IFN) but dependent on increased antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) driven by interleukin-17+(IL-17+) γδ+T cells within the nasal passages. This pathway of host defense against IAV infection in the upper airways during pregnancy restricts early viral infection and prevents virus dissemination into the lung supporting maternal fitness."

However, the chain transfer reaction impedes the formation of polymers from many common α-olefins such as propene and 1-butene using this method. Consequently, poly(α-olefins) are predominantly produced via coordination polymerization. To address this limitation, we have devised a strategy involving group transfer radical polymerization (GTRP) to facilitate the radical homopolymerization to access carbon-chain poly(α-olefins). This approach enables the precise construction of a diverse array of carbon-chain poly(α-olefins) with high molecular weights. Furthermore, by using nonconventional monomers, we extend the applicability of this technique to the copolymerization of α-olefins with acrylonitrile, paving the way for the synthesis of copolymers with different monomers. To investigate the properties of the polymers obtained by this method, one of the poly(α-olefins) is studied as an interphase layer material in anode-free Li metal batteries, and the results indicate the potential of the polymer in energy storage applications."

Transcriptomic analysis revealed temporal changes in gene expression and functions induced by the infection. A specific set of up-regulated genes remained active throughout the infection, and genes correlated and anticorrelated with virus accumulation were identified.

Further, peripheral eosinophilia and tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia (TATE) predicts a better response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in breast cancer. However, how and if estrogens affect eosinophil biology in tumors and how this influences ICB efficacy has not been determined. Here, we report that estrogens decrease the number of peripheral eosinophils and TATE, and this contributes to increased tumor growth in validated murine models of breast cancer and melanoma. Moreover, estrogen signaling in healthy female mice also suppressed peripheral eosinophil prevalence by decreasing the proliferation and survival of maturing eosinophils. Inhibiting estrogen receptor (ER) signaling decreased tumor growth in an eosinophil-dependent manner. Further, the efficacy of ICBs was increased when administered in combination with anti-estrogens. These findings highlight the importance of ER signaling as a regulator of eosinophil biology and TATE and highlight the potential near-term clinical application of ER modulators to increase ICB efficacy in multiple tumor types."

While certain bacterial species have been suggested to play driver roles in CRC, it is unknown whether the intestinal clock impinges on the microbiome to accelerate CRC pathogenesis. To address this, genetic disruption of the circadian clock, in anApc-driven mouse model of CRC, was used to define the impact on the gut microbiome. When clock disruption is combined with CRC, metagenomic sequencing identified dysregulation of many bacterial genera includingBacteroides,Helicobacter, andMegasphaera.We identify functional changes to microbial pathways including dysregulated nucleic acid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as disruption of intestinal barrier function.

We postulated a role for blood flow acting at endothelium in lipid regulatory organs. Transcriptome analysis was performed on livers from mice engineered for deletion of the flow-sensing PIEZO1 channel in endothelium. This revealed unique up-regulation ofCyp7a1, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for bile synthesis from cholesterol in hepatocytes. Consistent with this effect were increased gallbladder and plasma bile acids and lowered hepatic and plasma cholesterol. Elevated portal fluid flow acting via endothelial PIEZO1 and genetically enhanced PIEZO1 conversely suppressedCyp7a1. Activation of hepatic endothelial PIEZO1 channels promoted phosphorylation of nitric oxide synthase 3, and portal flow-mediated suppression ofCyp7a1depended on nitric oxide synthesis, suggesting endothelium-to-hepatocyte coupling via nitric oxide.PIEZO1variants in people were associated with hepatobiliary disease and dyslipidemia.

In our case, these internal Oersted fields have an orders of magnitude higher spin-wave excitation efficiency than commonly used stripline antennas. For magnetostrictive materials, we furthermore demonstrate that the direction of magnon propagation can be steered by increasing the excitation amplitude, which modifies the underlying magnetization profile through an additional anisotropy.

To achieve this, we constructed a laser cavity with both an NV diamond medium and an intracavity antireflection-coated diode laser. This dual-medium approach compensates intrinsic losses of the cavity by providing a fixed additional gain below threshold of the diode laser.

Then, we chose safer potassium azide as precursor for synthesizing cg-N. Through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition treatment, the free-standing cg-N was successfully synthesized without the need for high-pressure and nanoconfined effects. It demonstrated excellent thermal stability up to 760 K, and then rapid and intense thermal decomposition occurred, exhibiting typical thermal decomposition behaviors of high-energy-density materials.
