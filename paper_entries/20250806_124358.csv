10.1088/1748-9326/adeeaa,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要探讨了在国际气候变化政策中如何纳入公平性考虑，并评估了不同减排目标对福利和成本的影响。它比较了传统的成本最小化方法与基于努力分担机制和福利最大化的方法所产生的减排目标，考虑了不同地区在收入、排放、减排成本以及损害成本方面的差异。研究发现，在努力分担机制中考虑损害成本会导致发达地区（如欧洲和美国）制定更严格的目标。论文还探讨了通过灵活的工具（如排放交易）来实现这些目标的方法，以及福利最大化方法在没有排放交易的情况下的影响。总的来说，该论文关注的是气候政策的经济和社会影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,"['climate change policy', 'emission reduction targets', 'equity', 'welfare optimisation', 'mitigation costs', 'emission trading']",Kaj-Ivar van der Wijst;Andries Hof;Detlef van Vuuren,"Equity principles, mitigation and climate impacts: balancing welfare and costs","Equity considerations are crucial for successful international climate change policy. In this paper, several ways of incorporating equity in evaluating national climate targets are examined by comparing reduction targets resulting from the traditional cost-minimisation approach with those based on effort-sharing regimes and welfare optimisation taking into account not only regional differences in income, emissions and mitigation costs but also the latest insights in damage costs. We find that considering damage costs in effort-sharing regimes, leads to more stringent targets for developed regions like Europe and the USA compared to cost minimisation. One way to implement such schemes is via the use of flexible instruments, possibly leading to financial flows from emission trading of over 400 billion US$/yr in 2035. A welfare-maximising approach without emission trading is an alternative option, which leads to results that reduce emissions and global inequality, with no financial transfers. The downside is that global mitigation costs are higher due to the lack of emission trading. The reduction targets presented in this research can serve as input for updating national climate targets and presents ways to directly incorporate equity into Integrated Assessment Models scenarios often used by the IPCC."

These insights have revealed groundwater as a dynamic component of the water cycle and social–ecological systems, leading to an expansion in groundwater science that increasingly focuses on groundwater’s interactions with ecological, socioeconomic, and Earth systems. This shift presents many opportunities that are conditional on broader, more interdisciplinary system conceptualizations, models, and methods that require the integration of a greater diversity of data in contrast to conventional hydrogeological investigations. Here, we catalogue 144 global open access datasets and dataset collections relevant to groundwater science that span elements of the hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere, food systems, governance, management, and other socioeconomic system dimensions. The assembled catalogue offers a reference of available data for use in interdisciplinary assessments, and we summarize these data across their primary system, spatial resolution, temporal range, data type, generation method, level of groundwater representation, and institutional location of lead authorship. The catalogue includes 15 groundwater datasets, 23 datasets derived in relation to groundwater, and 106 datasets associated with groundwater. We find the majority of datasets are temporally static and that temporally dynamic data peak in availability during the 2000–2010 decade. Only a small fraction of temporally dynamic data is derived with any direct representation of groundwater, highlighting the need for greater incorporation of groundwater in Earth system models and data collection initiatives across socioeconomic, governance, and environmental science research communities. A small number of countries, led by the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada, generate most global groundwater data, reflecting a global North bias in the institutional leadership of these data generation activities. We raise three priority themes for future global groundwater data initiatives, which include: data improvements through prioritizing observed and temporally dynamic data; elevating regional and local scale data and perspectives to address challenges relating to equity and bias; and advancing data sharing initiatives founded on reciprocal benefits between global initiatives and data providers."

Contemporary interventions often target landscapes with a substantial human presence, and they regularly call for stakeholder participation during project implementation. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence linking local involvement with multiple forest benefits over long time horizons. Using a unique dataset of four decades of government-sponsored tree planting in North India, we find that both substantive local influence over planning projects and sustained control over management into the present—a favorable combination of long-term, empowered local governance—is associated with greater livelihood benefits and improvements in forest canopy cover over time. Our work points toward complex socio-ecological relationships, which may be explained by a positive interaction between empowered local governance, interventions that align with local needs, and long-term local care for planted forests. This implies that current financial commitments may need to be accompanied by institutional reforms that give communities meaningful control over planning and build capacities for self-governance that can endure into the future. In light of this work, we suggest that a paradigm of ‘people-centered restoration’ may offer the best opportunity to support long-term environmental goals in densely settled landscapes in the Global South."

Results show significant increases in marine accessibility, with near-complete summer accessibility across the Southern Ocean in February, even under the 1.5 °C Paris Agreement target. Winter marine accessibility also increases, with over 50% of the Southern Ocean accessible for PC6 vessels at 3 °C warming. Spatially, the Eastern Route region, especially in the King Haakon VII Sea, is projected to exhibit the most significant increase in accessibility.

As global warming progresses, the potential weakening of the AMOC raises concerns that meltwater from the disintegrating GrIS could trigger a complete AMOC shutdown. Here, we assess the processes and feedback mechanisms that may either accelerate or stabilize these two Earth system components under idealized future scenarios in an ice-sheet coupled Earth system model of intermediate complexity with perturbed parameter ensembles. Our findings indicate that, under a moderate idealized scenario (2×CO2,PI, corresponding to ∼3 °C global mean warming), GrIS meltwater alone is unlikely to trigger an AMOC collapse. However, this risk increases with higher emissions. Notably, the delayed GrIS response to the warming results in peak meltwater fluxes entering the North Atlantic only when the AMOC is already in its recovery phase, Thereby reducing the likelihood of collapse. Additionally, the system is further stabilized by the cooling induced by the thermal bipolar seesaw. This cooling is sufficiently strong that, in the event of a future AMOC collapse, GrIS melting would effectively cease for ∼3 °C warming, and its disintegration would be substantially delayed even under higher warming levels. Nonetheless, rapid CO2 reduction remains essential to prevent irreversible state transitions of both the AMOC and GrIS."

This study evaluates the projected drought evolution in the contiguous United States under the high-emission shared socioeconomic pathway 5–8.5 climate scenario for the coming decades. Using a multi-model ensemble of six Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 global climate models combined with dynamical downscaling techniques, we analyzed near-term (2020–2039) and mid-term (2040–2059) drought patterns using the self-calibrating palmer drought severity index (ScPDSI), the standardized precipitation index (SPI-12), and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI-12). Results reveal a widespread increase in abnormally dry (D0) and moderate drought (D1) conditions, particularly in urban areas, while severe (D2), extreme (D3), and exceptional (D4) droughts are expected to become less common in many regions. Meanwhile, persistent and intensifying droughts are projected in the western and southwestern U.S., driven by long-term soil moisture deficits. The ScPDSI projects that 1.1 million urban residents will be affected by D0 conditions in 2050, while SPI-12 suggests a decrease in the total affected populations after 2040. ScPDSI indicates prolonged droughts in the West, and SPI-12 captures transient variability. Although the total drought-exposed population is expected to decrease, urban areas will continue to bear a greater burden, particularly for mild droughts (D0, D1). These findings highlight a shift toward more frequent mild droughts, fewer severe droughts, and persistent drying in the Southwest, emphasizing the need for region-specific adaptation strategies."

This study investigates the teleconnection between tropical cyclone (TC) activities in the eastern North Pacific (ENP) and sea ice concentration (SIC) over the Arctic. Observational analysis reveals that ENP TC activities during summer contribute to decelerating the loss of the Arctic sea ice in September. Mechanistically, ENP TC activities induce large-scale meridional circulation anomalies that modify Arctic atmospheric circulation, resulting in anomalous northwesterly winds over the Arctic. This leads to decreased surface temperatures and humidity, thereby facilitating sea ice growth. Simulations confirm that TC-driven atmospheric changes contribute to an increase in SIC. The significance of tropical-extratropical teleconnections in Arctic climate variability is emphasized by these findings, suggesting that ENP TC activities could serve as a novel tropical factor for predicting SIC over the Arctic."

Here, we investigate the ability of OCO-2/3 retrievals to constrain CO2 emissions for the state of California for the major emission sectors (i.e., fossil fuels, net ecosystem exchange, and wildfire). 
 Satellite observations are instrumental in observing spatiotemporal variability in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, which can be used to derive fluxes of this greenhouse gas. This study leverages NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 and -3 (OCO-2 and OCO-3, respectively) CO2 observations with a Gaussian process (GP) machine learning inverse model, a Bayesian nonparametric approach well suited for integrating the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of these satellite observations, to estimate subregional CO2 fluxes. Utilizing the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) to simulate column-average CO2 concentrations (XCO2) for 2020 in California – a period marked by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, drought conditions, and significant wildfire activity – we estimated the state-wide CO2 emission rates constrained by OCO-2/3. This study developed prior fossil fuel emissions to reflect reduced activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, while net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and fire emissions were derived based on satellite data. GEOS-Chem source-specific XCO2 concentrations for fossil fuels, NEE, fire, and oceanic sources were simulated coincident to OCO-2/3 XCO2 retrievals to estimate state-wide sector-specific and total CO2 emissions. GP inverse model results suggest that annual posterior median fossil fuel emissions were consistent with prior estimates (317.8 and 338.4 Tg CO2 yr−1, respectively; 95 % confidence level) and that posterior NEE fluxes had less carbon uptake compared to prior fluxes (−36.8 vs. −99.2 Tg CO2 yr−1, respectively; 95 % confidence level). Posterior fire CO2 emissions were estimated to be 68.0 Tg CO2 yr−1, which was much lower than a priori estimates (103.3 Tg CO2 yr−1). The total median annual CO2 emissions for the state of California in 2020 were estimated to be 349.6 Tg CO2 yr−1 (range of 272.8–428.6 Tg CO2 yr−1; 95 % confidence level), aligning closely with the prior total estimate of 342.5 Tg CO2 yr−1. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that OCO-2/3 XCO2 observations can be assimilated into inverse models to estimate state-wide source-specific CO2 fluxes on a seasonal and annual scale."

Based on field campaigns conducted in Harbin, we successively identified the analytical method that could lead to proper results of organic and elemental carbon. Our results are believed to be a support for future efforts in the exploration of PM2.5 sources in northeastern China, which are essential for further improving the regional air quality. 
 As China's fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has decreased nationwide during the last decade, further improvement of air quality has become more challenging, imposing higher requirements on the observational support for the understanding of aerosol sources. This was particularly the case for the severe cold-climate region in Northeast China, which suffered from relatively slow decrease rate and high exposure risk of PM2.5. Here, we evaluated carbonaceous aerosol data measured by different sampling and analytical approaches based on field campaigns conducted during a frigid winter and an agricultural-fire-impacted spring in Harbin. For both the high- and low-volume sampling, a total of four sets of organic and elemental carbon results were derived by applying two commonly used temperature protocols (IMPROVE-A – i.e., IMPV – and NIOSH) to both untreated filters and those extracted by methanol. Only the IMPV-based results measured before the extraction were found to be indicative of aerosol sources, e.g., in reasonable accordance with secondary aerosol formation in winter and open-burning impacts in spring. Thus, the analytical method of IMPROVE-A with untreated samples is recommended for future field observations and source apportionments of PM2.5 in the studied region. In addition, although the low- and high-volume samplers typically led to comparable measurement results for various species, exceptions were identified for water-soluble potassium (K+) and some fire-emitted chromophores. We suggest that K+ and light absorption coefficients of brown carbon should be compared or integrated with caution across studies using different PM2.5 samplers."

In this study, methods to measure these interactions are improved, enhancing our understanding of Arctic climate processes. 
 The Arctic is experiencing a warming much faster than the global average and aerosol–cloud–sea–ice interactions are considered to be one of the key features of the Arctic climate system. It is therefore crucial to identify particle sources and sinks to study their impact on cloud formation and cloud properties in the Arctic. Near-surface particle and sensible heat fluxes were measured using the gradient method during the ARTofMELT Arctic Ocean Expedition 2023. A gradient system was deployed to calculate sensible heat and particle fluxes over three different surface conditions: wide lead, narrow lead, and closed ice. To evaluate the gradient measurements, sensible heat fluxes and friction velocities were compared with eddy covariance data. The strongest mean sensible heat fluxes, ranging from 16   to 51 W m−2, were observed over wide lead surfaces, aligning with measurements from the icebreaker. In contrast, closed ice surfaces had weak, often negative, sensible heat fluxes. Wide leads acted as a particle source, with median net particle emission fluxes of 0.09 × 106 m−2 s−1. Narrow lead surfaces exhibited both net emission and net deposition, though the particle fluxes were weaker. Closed ice  surfaces acted as a particle sink, with normalized fluxes around 0.06 cm s−1. The gradient method was found to be effective for measuring both sensible heat and particle fluxes, allowing flexible deployment over different surface types. This study addresses the critical need for improved quantification of turbulent vertical particle fluxes and related processes that influence the local particle number budget in the high Arctic."

Combined with cloud radar and reanalysis data, the fine categorization results reveal HOICs occur in calm winds and moderately cold temperatures and are influenced by turbulence near cloud bases. The results enhance our understanding of cloud processes and improve atmospheric models. 
 The orientation of ice crystals plays a significant role in determining their radiative and precipitating effects; horizontally oriented ice crystals (HOICs) reflect up to ∼40 % more shortwave radiation back to space than randomly oriented ice crystals (ROICs). This study introduces an automatic range-resolved algorithm for HOIC identification using a combination of ground-based zenith-pointing and 15°  off-zenith-pointing polarization lidars. The lidar observations provided high-resolution cloud-phase information. The data were collected in Beijing over 354 d in 2022. A case study from 13 October 2022 is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of the detection method. The synergy of lidars and collocated Ka-band cloud radar, radiosonde, and ERA5 data provides phenomenological insights into HOIC events. While cloud radar Doppler velocity data allowed the estimation of ice crystal size, Reynolds numbers, and turbulent eddy dissipation rates, corresponding environmental and radar-detected variables are also provided. HOICs were present, accompanied by weak horizontal wind of 0–20 m s−1 and relatively high temperature between −8 and −22 °C. Compared to the ROICs, HOICs exhibited larger reflectivity, larger spectral width, a larger turbulent eddy dissipation rate, and a median Doppler velocity of about 0.8 m s−1. Ice crystal diameters (1029 to 1756 µm for 5th and 95th percentiles) and Reynolds numbers (28 to 88 for 5th and 95th percentiles) are also estimated with the help of cloud radar Doppler velocity using an aerodynamic model. One interesting finding is that the previously found switch-off region of the specular reflection in the region of cloud base shows a higher turbulence eddy dissipation rate, probably caused by the latent heat released due to the sublimation of ice crystals in the cloud-base region. The newly derived properties of HOICs have the potential to aid the derivation of the likelihood of their occurrence in output from general circulation models (GCMs) of the atmosphere."

Comparisons of the measured data for cloudless days with values from a radiation transfer model provide a basis for data homogenisation. Averaged results from different versions of the recalculated data give the 1976−2004 trend of about 6 % per 10 years in annual RE for all biological effects. 
 A long-term series of exposures to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is required to assess the risks and benefits of radiation for different human biological processes. However, homogenisation of the amount of biologically effective solar energy (i.e. energy-weighted according to the sensitivity of the selected biological process to solar radiation) reaching the Earth's surface over long periods is challenging due to changes in measurement methods and instruments. This paper presents the world's longest homogenised time series of biologically effective daily radiant exposures (DRE) from regular monitoring with different erythemal broadband radiometers (EBRs) operated at the Central Geophysical Laboratory of the Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences (IG PAS), Belsk (20.79° E, 51.84° N), from 1 January 1976 to 31 December 2023. The following biological effects were considered: erythema, cutaneous synthesis of previtamin D3, and clearing of psoriatic lesions. The data for the latter two biological effects are estimated based on the proposed method of using EBR measurements to calculate other non-erythemal DRE. The following EBRs were used in the monitoring: Robertson–Berger meter (1975–1992), Solar Light model 501 (1993–1994 with #927, 1995–2013 with #2011), and Kipp & Zonen UV-AE-T #30616 from 5 August 2013 to the present. From 1976 to 2013, the homogenisation procedure consisted of comparing the measured erythemal DRE and daily maximum of UV index (UVIMAX) with the corresponding modelled values from simulations using a radiation transfer model for cloudless conditions. Between 2014 and 2023, the EBR data were compared with data from a collocated reference instrument, the Brewer Mark II #64 spectrophotometer. Such comparisons resulted in a set of multipliers that were applied to the EBR measurements. Two different versions of the homogenisation method were applied, analysing modelled and observed values for erythemal DRE and UVIMAX assuming different criteria for cloudless days. Three regression models of the erythemal data on common UVR proxy data (total column ozone, aerosol optical depth, and global clear-sky irradiance index) were used to reconstruct the UVR data from the beginning of the Belsk observations, allowing further validation of the homogenised UVR data. Linear trends calculated showed a statistically significant increase in erythemal annual and summer (June to August) radiant exposures of about 6 % per decade over the period 1976–2005. Thereafter, no trend was observed. Similar trend estimates were found for all biological effects considered.

A database of daily rainfall series was developed for three climate normals –CNs– (1968–1997, 1978–2007, 1988–2017) with over 5,000 series. We found median erosivity values of 3245, 3070, and 3327 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1 for the three CNs. The resulting publicly available datasets of rainfall series and erosivity help better understand SWE and rainfall patterns across Mexico. 
 Soil water erosion (SWE) is the dominant soil degradation driver on a global scale. For quantifying SWE, erosivity is an index that reflects the potential (i.e., the energy) of rainfall to cause SWE. To support large-scale SWE studies and the assessment of the SWE process at the national scale in Mexico, the objectives of this research are a) to develop the first Mexican rainfall time series database for three climate normals CNs (1968–1997, 1978–2007, and 1988–2017) leveraging legacy climate data, and b) to estimate rainfall erosivity across continental Mexico by using daily rainfall time series. The workflow has three methodological moments: 1) development of the daily rainfall time series database, 2) identification of the best empirical relationship to estimate daily rainfall erosivity, and 3) estimation of the rainfall erosivity across Mexican territory. We compiled and harmonized 5410 rainfall time series (RTS) well distributed across the Mexican territory. We perform quality control and assurance, homogeneity analysis (using the normal homogeneity test), and the data gap-filling process (using the proportion method). Then, we tested three combinations of the α and β coefficients, proposed by three authors, in a power model to estimate rainfall erosivity; in this step, we used three validation databases (global, national, and local scales). Finally, we estimated the annual rainfall erosivity for all three CNs with multiple combinations of α and β coefficients. As principal results, the new database includes 1370, 1678, and 1676 RTS for each CN and its corresponding rainfall erosivity. The best parameter combination is the one proposed by Richardson et al. (1983) for all three validation databases. For the global and national databases, we observe a positive bias (Mean error of 956 and 324 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1, respectively); in contrast, for the local database, results show a negative and higher bias (Mean error of -3699 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1). About the erosivity estimation across the Mexican territory, the median values for rainfall erosivity for the three CNs were 3245, 3070, and 3327 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1, respectively. The statistical distribution of the erosivity values was right-skewed for the three CNs, with high erosivity values reaching >12000 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1 in all three CNs. The behavior throughout the year of the rainfall erosivity was similar for the three CNs. However, September had the highest contribution to the rainfall erosivity. The new database provides daily climatological data and analysis across Mexican territory through a multi-year period (1968 to 2017). Rainfall erosivity results support the study of SWE at the national scale by identifying areas with higher susceptibility to soil loss due to rainfall action and providing a more spatially dense and well-documented rainfall erosivity database.

Environment90m is a new dataset, which aggregates 103 environmental variables across the 726 million sub-catchments of the Hydrography90m river network. It includes present and future climate, land cover, soils, topography, hydrographic and streamflow information. Environment90m provides an array of opportunities for research and applications in freshwater science. 
 The current loss of freshwater habitats and biodiversity calls for an immediate mobilization and application of existing data and tools to contribute to the development of sound strategies for their long-term conservation. However, one particular challenge for obtaining a baseline regarding the spatial distribution of freshwater habitats and biodiversity is the need for standardized high-resolution environmental information, which ideally can provide a characterization of freshwater habitats anywhere in the world. To address this challenge, we present the Environment90m dataset which aggregates a large number of environmental layers into each of the 726 million sub-catchments of the Hydrography90m dataset, corresponding to single stream segments. Specifically, Environment90m includes 45 variables related to topography and hydrography, 19 climate variables for the observation period of 1981–2010, as well as projections for 2041–2070 and 2071–2100 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 1.26, 3.70 and 5.85, and three global circulation models (UKESM, MPI and IPSL). Moreover, Environment90m includes 22 land cover categories for the annual time-series data from 1992–2020. In addition, we provide 15 soil variables and information on aridity and modelled streamflow. Summary statistics (i.e., mean, min, max, range, sd) are provided for all continuous variables while for categorical data, the proportion of each category is calculated within each of the sub-catchments. The data is available at https://hydrography.org/environment90m. To facilitate data download and processing, we provide dedicated functions within the hydrographr R-package. For all underlying calculations, we used the open-source tools GDAL/OGR, GRASS-GIS and AWK, so that custom data can be easily generated using the hydrographr R-package.

Fausto,PROMICE-2022 Ice Mask: A high-resolution outline of the Greenland Ice Sheet from August 2022,"We mapped the edge of the Greenland Ice Sheet using recent satellite images to create a detailed outline of its extent in 2022. This helps track how the ice sheet is changing as the climate warms. By carefully combining satellite data and checking results by hand, we created one of the most accurate maps of the ice sheet to date. This map supports research on ice loss and improves predictions of future changes in Greenland’s ice and its effect on the planet. 
 The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is losing mass at an accelerating rate in response to climate change. Its geometry responds to these changes over annual to decadal timescales, therefore making accurate and up-to-date mapping of its extent essential for monitoring ice loss, assessing mass balance, and improving climate and glaciological models. Ice margin outlines serve as critical boundary conditions for different types of modelling exercises, hydrological studies, and assessments of ice sheet dynamics. Here, we present the PROMICE-2022 Ice Mask, a high-resolution outline of the contiguous ice masses of the GrIS and the nunataks in its interior as of late August 2022. The dataset was derived from a true-colour Sentinel-2 mosaic at 10 m spatial resolution, generated using the Sentinel Hub Cloud Processing API to select the most recent valid pixels from August 2022. The mapping process was performed manually and supplemented with high-resolution mosaics from Sentinel-2 and SPOT 6/7 provided by the Danish Agency for Climate Data (KDS), along with recent topographic vector data. We mapped the geodesic perimeter length of the GrIS to 53,060 km and its glacierized area to 1,725,648 km² with 19,130 nunataks in its interior. The PROMICE-2022 ice mask captures the GrIS margin with an absolute horizontal accuracy better than 20 m. Its quality and consistency make it well suited for applications in ice sheet modelling, hydrology, glacial geomorphology, and long-term monitoring of ice margin change.

Mackay;Natalia Piotrowska;Maarten Blaauw,Insights into Lake Baikal Radiocarbon Age Offsets from a Database of AMS Radiocarbon Age Estimates,"Lake sediment cores are records of ancient climate change. Radiocarbon dates help us understand these records. Radiocarbon data from Lake Baikal can be difficult to access or understand. We present a database of all published radiocarbon data from Lake Baikal sediment cores to facilitate re-use of this data quickly and efficiently. We then evaluate a key correction required to use radiocarbon data. We show that uncertainty in estimating this correction is much larger than previously thought. 
 Radiocarbon dates are an essential tool for dating non-varved lake sediments, however their interpretation is hindered by issues such as reservoir age or contamination which culminate in age estimates that can be thousands of years younger or older than the true depositional age of that sediment (we call this an age offset). Often, precise estimators of the radiocarbon age offset are not available, as in the case of Lake Baikal. Linear regression of uncalibrated radiocarbon dates has been used to estimate the age offset, with answers ranging from 0 to 1500 14C yr BP. These have been interpreted to suggest that different regions of Lake Baikal have different age offsets, although some dispute this. Other estimators have returned estimates of approximately 2000 14C yr BP. Despite this, most previous studies have not included any estimates of uncertainties for these age offsets in their proxy analysis, or have included uncertainty of, at most, ± 90 14C yr. Here, we present a complete database of published AMS radiocarbon dates from Lake Baikal sediment cores up to 2023 and, using this, review the use of linear regression on uncalibrated radiocarbon ages as a method for estimating age offsets from the sediments of Lake Baikal. We apply a standardised linear regression age offset method to all cores in our database to better quantify the age offset of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in the lake’s sediments. We conclude that there is no statistically significant evidence from linear regression methods for a large difference in age offset in different regions of Lake Baikal. Our results return a lake-wide age offset estimate of TOC of 1.56 ± 0.75 14C kyr BP, suggesting previous studies in Lake Baikal have significantly underestimated the temporal uncertainty of radiocarbon ages. Finally, our results are a caution that linear regression-based age offset estimates in lake sediments have a large uncertainty that might only be observable with multiple datasets."

We describe the standardized processing and quality assurance pipeline, from filter collection and processing using the Ice Nucleation Spectrometer to final data products archived on the ARM Data Discovery portal.

It features a continuous 5-year record of INP measurements from a central U.S. site, with data collection still ongoing. Seasonal and site-specific differences in INP concentrations are illustrated through intercomparisons at −10 °C and −20 °C, revealing distinct regional sources and atmospheric drivers. We also outline mechanisms for researchers to access existing data, request additional sample analyses, and propose future field campaigns involving ARM INP measurements.

Our study shows that the plant blooms widely during wet years and is often found near roads and moist areas. The developed percent cover maps using field data, drone images, and machine learning models would help land managers find and control this invasive species, protecting Northern Great Plains grasslands. 
 Yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis (L.) Lam.; MEOF) is an invasive forb pervasive across the Northern Great Plains, often linked to traits such as wide adaptability, strong stress tolerance, and high productivity. Despite MEOF's prevalent ecological-economic impacts and importance, knowledge of its spatial distribution and temporal evolution is extremely limited. Here, we aim to develop a spatial database of annual MEOF abundance (2016–2023) across western South Dakota (SD) at 10 m spatial resolution by applying a generalized prediction model on Sentinel-2 imagery. We collected in situ quadrat-based total vegetation cover with MEOF percent cover estimates across western SD from 2021 through 2023 and synthesized with other available percent cover estimates (2016–2022) of several federal, state, and non-governmental sources. We conducted drone overflights at 14 sites across Butte County, SD in 2023 to develop very high spatial resolution (4–6 cm) and accurate MEOF cover maps by applying a random forest (RF) classification model. The field-measured and uncrewed aerial system (UAS) derived MEOF percent cover estimates were used to train, test, and validate a RF regression model. The predicted MEOF percent cover dataset was validated with UAS-derived percent cover in 2023 across four sites (out of 14 sites). We found that the variation in the Tasseled Cap Greenness and Normalized Difference Yellowness Index were among the top predicting variables in predicting MEOF abundance. Our predictive model yielded greater accuracies with an R2 of 0.76, RMSE of 15.11 %, MAE of 10.95 %, and MAPE of 1.06 %. We validated our 2023 predicted maps using the 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery for regions where field samples could not be collected in 2023. The database of MEOF abundance showed consecutive years of average or above-average precipitation yielded a higher MEOF abundance across the study region.

It provides a new way to model how these systems interact and how they could work together towards reaching global sustainability targets, for example, to mitigate climate change. This paper describes how the model works and the results it can produce and how these compare to results from other models. 
 SuCCESs (Sustainable Climate Change mitigation strategies in Energy–land–material Systems) is a bottom-up integrated assessment model (IAM) that represents energy production and use, materials production, land use, and climate globally. The primary use case for SuCCESs is to calculate long-term scenarios until 2100 that consider the interactions between these systems, for example, the greenhouse gas emissions from energy, materials, and land use and their impact on climate change. The four systems are hard-linked in SuCCESs, and scenarios are solved through intertemporal optimization by minimizing discounted system costs to satisfy projected demand and other constraints, e.g. climate targets. This yields a long-term equilibrium solution between the modelled systems. This article introduces the model logic and structure, describes the overall representation of each system, and provides an evaluation by comparing the scenarios produced by SuCCESs with different end-of-century radiative forcing targets to those from other IAMs. Towards this end and to demonstrate the capability of SuCCESs for large-scale scenario exploration, we also conduct a sensitivity analysis employing Monte Carlo sampling with a 1000-member scenario ensemble for each radiative forcing target. Lastly, we discuss some practical aspects and different ways of using the model in long-term scenario analyses."

Here, we use artificial neural networks to correct air–sea heat fluxes as a function of oceanic and atmospheric state predictors. The correction successfully improves surface and subsurface ocean temperatures beyond the training period and in prediction experiments. 
 The atmospheric forcing and the heat exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere represent one of the major sources of uncertainty for numerical ocean reconstructions and predictions, together with inaccuracies in vertical mixing and solar radiation penetration. Air–sea heat fluxes may suffer from inaccuracies in meteorological fields, sea surface variables, and bulk formulations, which have a strongly nonlinear dependence on the ocean state. Here, state-dependent errors in heat fluxes are learned by artificial neural networks (ANNs) from a dataset of heat flux correction terms, derived in turn from previous sea surface temperature nudging experiments. The pre-trained model predictors include stationary fields, atmospheric forcing data, ocean state, and stratification indices. Variable importance scores emphasize the dependence of air–sea heat flux errors on wind forcing. The pre-trained heat flux correction model is then used to adaptively correct fluxes online, in a series of global ocean experiments performed with the NEMO version 4 (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) ocean general circulation model, augmented with ANN inference capabilities in Fortran90. Results indicate the positive impact of the correction procedure, beyond the training period, e.g. in independent observation–poor and –rich periods, leading to the same dynamic and subsurface signature as in nudging experiments. Prediction experiments also indicate the method's potential for use in operational forecast applications. The method may also be adopted in coupled long-term reanalyses, long-range predictions, and projections."

In this study, we used multiple analytical platforms to investigate the chemistry of ConAC-rich humic acids (HA) extracted from Terra Mulata de Indio, a type of Amazonian anthrosol. The results reveal that ConAC are predominantly nonprotonated and consist of approximately 4–10 condensed rings. These structures exhibit varying degrees of oxygenation (1–24 oxygen atoms), suggesting that they are produced through oxidative processes. Approximately 20% of ConAC contain nitrogen atoms, referred to as ConAN (condensed aromatic nitrogen), which are part of either  heterocyclic ring systems (commonly termed black nitrogen) or present as amine functional groups. As a result, we conclude that HA in Amazonian anthrosols contain polycyclic N-containing aromatic acids (PolyNARA), likely formed through combined charring of plant and animal biomass, abiotic  nitrogen incorporation, and/or other soil processes. The mechanisms governing the formation, persistence, and transformation of PolyNARA in Amazonian anthrosols warrant further investigation, particularly given their potential implications for global carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycling."

This study investigates the formation of airborne nanoparticles (6–500 nm) during such activities as a previously unrecognized source of indoor air pollution. Experiments conducted in the Purdue zEDGE Test House revealed that hair styling at temperatures above 300 °F produced indoor nanoparticle concentrations ranging from 10,000 to over 100,000 particles cm–3, with sub-100 nm particles typically accounting for more than 95% of total number concentrations at temperatures exceeding 360 °F. The primary mechanism for nanoparticle formation was heat-driven volatilization of cyclic siloxanes and various low-volatility constituents in hair care products, followed by nanoparticle nucleation and subsequent growth via condensation and coagulation. Ozonolysis of fragrance additives served as a secondary formation pathway. Respiratory tract deposition modeling indicated that more than 10 billion nanoparticles could deposit in the respiratory system during a single hair styling session, with the highest dose occurring in the pulmonary region. These findings identify heat-based hair styling as a significant indoor source of airborne nanoparticles and highlight previously underestimated exposure risks.

Through a large-scale enclosure experiment simulating ammonium pulses (1.24 mg/L NH4–N), we tested how submerged macrophytes coverage (SMC, 0–100%) modulates water quality, ecosystem resilience, and regime shifts (from clear to turbid). The system’s buffering capacity and resilience stability increased significantly with SMC, whereas its recovery stability decreased. High SMC (>50%) accelerated NH4–N removal (96 h vs 168 h in controls), suppressed phytoplankton blooms (Chl-a increase: 102.5% vs 237.4%), and sustained clear water. Conversely, low and medium SMC (<50%) did not prevent transitions to algal-dominated states. Furthermore, NH4–N stress was inversely correlated with SMC, and persistently high NH4–N at low SMC increased macrophyte degradation risk. Structural equation modeling revealed that macrophytes-mediated nutrient competition and light stabilization underpinned these effects. Additionally, we identify a critical SMC threshold (39–51%) to mitigate pulse impacts─a finding urgently needed to guide lake restoration in a changing climate. This work bridges the gap between pulse ecology and adaptive management, offering actionable strategies for SDG 6 (Clean Water) and 13 (Climate Action)."

Nanoplastics (NPs), as emerging engineered nanoparticles, can cause toxicity to aquatic organisms. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of NPs on aquatic insect emergence are not clear. Here, we explored the accumulation of NPs, phenotypic alterations, and physiological and transcriptional responses of Chironomus kiinensis to NPs carrying positive (NP+) and negative (NP−) charges under environmentally relevant concentrations. Results revealed that NP+ induced more reduction of the emergence rate (85.6% for 1 g/kg NP– group and 77.8% for 1 g/kg NP+ group) and the increase of emergence time of C. kiinensis than NP–. This occurred because NP+ were more easily accumulated in larvae than NP– for their stronger electrostatic interactions with negatively charged biomembranes and less agglomeration in exposure media. Compared with NP–, NP+ led to greater oxidative damage through perturbation of the gene expression related to oxidative stress in C. kiinensis. Moreover, the expression of genes associated with emergence was more disrupted in organisms exposed to NP+ than that exposed to NP–, thereby influencing the hormone contents and emergence process of insect. These findings provided new insights into the molecular mechanism that charged NPs affect aquatic insect emergence."

Catalysts with balanced competence to reduce NOx and oxidize CVOCs, as well as the resistance to chlorine poisoning, are critical to SyCR. Here, neighboring effects over SmMn2O5 mullite (SMO) modified by HZSM-5 composite catalysts (SMO-Z) were demonstrated in the Cl-resistant SyCR of NOx and chlorobenzene (CB, a representative CVOCs). Characterizations demonstrated that HZSM-5 modification did not alter the crystal structure of SMO and retained Mn–O–Mn–Mn active sites for the SyCR of NOx and CB. HZSM-5 regulated the redox ability of SMO-Z to reduce the formation of inert nitrate species and to promote the N2 selectivity. Acidic HZSM-5 acted as dechlorination sites to promote the breakage of the C–Cl bond via the nucleophilic substitution reaction and accelerated the formation of HCl to avoid Cl poisoning on catalysts. The fine-tuned compensation of surface acidity by HZSM-5 suppressed the competitive adsorption of NH3 and CB on SMO-Z, which promoted NOx reduction at high temperatures, whereupon neighboring effects between HZSM-5 acidic dechlorination sites and SMO active redox sites on SMO-Z capitally promoted the SyCR efficiency and antichlorination poisoning performance."

These compounds can react with nitrate radicals (NO3), a key nighttime oxidant, to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Although SOA is traditionally assumed to be noncrystalline, we present surprising evidence from X-ray diffraction that SOA formed from catechol + NO3 in an atmospheric simulation chamber contains crystalline material. In addition, the diffraction pattern and mass spectrum of this SOA closely resemble those of nebulized crystalline 4-nitrocatechol (4-NC), suggesting the presence of crystalline 4-NC within the SOA. These findings help explain unusual size distributions of catechol + NO3 SOA observed in prior studies and conflicting measurements of 4-NC’s effective saturation vapor concentrations. Calculations of 4-NC’s melting temperature as a function of its mole fraction in SOA, combined with observations of ambient 4-NC concentrations, suggest that 4-NC can exist in a solid crystalline phase state at temperatures below 288 K in wildfire plumes in the atmosphere. The presence of crystalline 4-NC and crystalline SOA in wildfire plumes may affect particle size distributions, cloud formation, and heterogeneous and photolytic reaction rates, with potentially important implications for atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate, warranting additional studies on this topic."

While the secondary BrC formation via dark reactions involving ammonium and glyoxal/methylglyoxal (NH4+-G/MG) has been extensively documented, their photochemical behaviors remain poorly understood. This study investigates the photoinduced chemical changes of G, MG, and BrC species during irradiation. The dominant BrC species in NH4+-G systems and NH4+-MG systems are imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (2-IC) and 1-(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl) ethanone (M-IE), respectively, which are identified as potent photosensitizers experimentally, with support from density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Reactive oxygen species derived from photolysis and photosensitization contribute to compositional diversity by yielding small organic acids and ring-opening products (e.g., amides). Interestingly, in NH4+-MG systems, both M-IE and MG can initiate the transformation of the dominant nonlight-absorbing product (i.e., 5-methylimidazole, 5-MIM) into imidazole-5-carboxaldehyde (5-IC), which is a BrC species and a potential photosensitizer. This work elucidates the photoinduced transformations in NH4+-G/MG systems at a molecular level and highlights that MG and M-IE are sources of oxidants to form new BrC species via photosensitization.

As bivalves rely solely on innate immunity to cope with environmental challenges, the responses of their hemocyte subpopulations to hypoxia remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the immune responses of an estuarine oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis under moderate (2.0 mg/L) and severe (0.2 mg/L) hypoxic exposure. Flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging analyses revealed that granulocytes, the dominant immune effector subtype, exhibited dynamic structural and functional adaptations. Moderate hypoxia initially enhanced phagocytic activity at 48 h, whereas severe hypoxia suppressed phagocytosis, followed by partial recovery. Granulocytes accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a time- and severity-dependent pattern, accompanied by progressive depletion of glutathione (GSH). Mitochondrial dysfunction was evidenced by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increased morphological fragmentation. Meanwhile, lysosomal activity was elevated in terms of higher quantity and area. Increased colocalization of mitochondria and lysosomes indicated the activation of mitophagy; however, under severe hypoxia, the lysosomal degradation capacity was compromised due to membrane instability. These findings indicated that granulocytes deployed compensatory organelle-level mechanisms to mitigate hypoxic stress, although persistent severe hypoxia may overwhelm these responses.

Nearly all of the highest observed concentrations were observed at night. For each night in the simulation, the location and magnitude of the maximum predicted concentration and maximum observed concentration were compared, and approximately two-thirds of the highest observed nighttime maximum concentrations were accounted for by routine emissions. In contrast, approximately a third of the highest daytime maxima could be accounted for by routine emissions. Most of the large observed maxima that are attributable to routine emissions are predicted to be caused by sources that were within 10 km of the receptor site, but sources up to 20 or more kilometers from the receptor also contributed to the predicted concentrations.

Allegrini,Rotating Finger‐Like Structures of Jovian Magnetodisc,"At Jupiter, the plasma is concentrated near the centrifugal equator, forming a magnetodisc. The planet's dipole tilt induces periodic disc flapping, generating magnetic oscillations observed by spacecraft. While centrifugal forces are theorized to drive interchange instability in this system, direct detection of such structures remains challenging due to flapping‐induced variabilities. However, in situ and remote sensing data reveal ∼tens‐of‐minute periodicities proposed to link to interchange dynamics. Using unique Juno observations, we analyze two events to: (a) resolve highly variable magnetic curvature changes during successive plasma sheet crossings and (b) identify periodic ∼30‐min fluctuations in plasma measurements in the magnetodisc while Juno occupied a magnetically favorable location. These findings provide the first direct examination of interchange‐related magnetic curvature evolution and plasma signatures, to advance our understanding of the magnetodisc's 3D structure and instability‐driven dynamics."

This study investigates the causes of the recent regime shift in Antarctic sea‐ice extent (SIE) using a global sea ice–ocean model with 0.25° resolution forced by atmospheric reanalysis‐based surface boundary conditions. Numerical experiments reveal that thermodynamic boundary conditions, particularly the increased subpolar sea surface temperatures (SSTs) north of the sea‐ice edge, are the dominant drivers of Antarctic sea‐ice decline. Additionally, wind stress partly contributes to the variability in summer SIE. These findings highlight that SST warming near the sea‐ice edge, resulting from atmosphere–ocean interactions under ongoing atmospheric warming, plays a key role in the recent decline in Antarctic SIE."

However, regardless of the season and IMF conditions, similar auroral forms rarely occur in the prenoon. The reason for this asymmetry remains a mystery. By comparing concurrent auroral observations in both hemispheres, we found that when the polarity of the IMF By (positive), which favors the formation of the specific postnoon auroral forms, is reversed (negative), a phenomenon called Prenoon Auroral Oval Poleward Shift (PAOPS) can be often observed in the summer hemisphere. This highlights a new finding about prenoon‐postnoon auroral asymmetry. PAOPS occurrence exhibits solar cycle dependence, seasonal preference, and IMF control. Energy‐dispersed ions suggest PAOPS originates from magnetic reconnection between IMF and geomagnetic fields in the lobe region."

Overall, the multi‐model ensemble significantly overestimates the intensity of storm‐associated extreme precipitation, with global average biases of 19.1% for TCs, 11.4% for ETCs, and 12.2% for ARs. This corresponds to at least a 57% higher risk of storm‐associated extreme precipitation above the 99.9th percentile in the models. The skill score of the CMIP6 multi‐model ensemble mean ranks in the mid‐range among the models, while high‐resolution models typically achieve higher scores. Composite rainfall structure analysis indicates that, although CMIP6 models roughly reproduce the overall structure of extreme precipitation associated with the three storm types, they display significant wet biases with pronounced regional features. These regional differences are primarily influenced by flawed dynamical processes, while moisture conditions play a secondary role."

 The periodic table provides an intuitive framework for understanding chemical properties. However, its traditional patterns may break down for the heaviest elements occupying the bottom of the chart. The large nuclei of actinides (Z > 88) and superheavy elements (Z ≥ 104) give rise to relativistic effects that are expected to substantially alter their chemical behaviours, potentially indicating that we have reached the end of a predictive periodic table1. Relativistic effects have already been cited for the unusual chemistry of the actinides compared with those of their lanthanide counterparts2. Unfortunately, it is difficult to understand the full impact of relativistic effects, as research on the later actinides and superheavy elements is scarce. Beyond fermium (Z = 100), elements need to be produced and studied one atom at a time, using accelerated ion beams and state-of-the-art experimental approaches. So far, no experiments have been capable of directly identifying produced molecular species. Here ions of actinium (Ac, Z = 89) and nobelium (No, Z = 102) were synthesized through nuclear reactions at the 88-Inch Cyclotron facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and then exposed to trace amounts of H2O and N2. The produced molecular species were directly identified by measuring their mass-to-charge ratios using FIONA (For the Identification Of Nuclide A)3. These results mark the first, to our knowledge, direct identification of heavy-element molecular species using an atom-at-a-time technique and highlight the importance of such identifications in future superheavy-element chemistry experiments to deepen understanding of their chemical properties. Mass number measurements of the molecular species produced when ions of actinium (Ac) and nobelium (No) are exposed to trace amounts of H2O and N2 demonstrate direct species identification using an atom-at-a-time technique for heavy elements."

 In the littoral zone, at the land–water interface of lakes, the areal productivity of aquatic vegetation rivals that of rainforests, resulting in a potentially very high carbon (C) turnover. Whereas tidal wetlands at the land–ocean interface are included in global C budgets, lake littoral zones are currently not accounted for, despite the total shoreline of lakes being estimated at four times longer than that of the global ocean. Here we quantify the littoral net atmospheric C sink using mass balance and a model of C export from the littoral to the pelagic zone. We argue that ignoring littoral C turnover in lakes potentially results in biased estimates of continental C cycling. In our global estimate, we show that the estimated global C balance of lakes may reverse from a net C source to a net C sink (that is, net C burial > net C outgassing). In addition, a large part of the C outgassed in the pelagic might originate from the littoral, implying that previous estimates of terrestrial C inputs to inland waters were too high. We argue that quantifying and modelling lake littoral C fluxes are essential to more accurately estimate the feedback between the continents and climate.

Targeting CSLD5 expression in specific cell layers can restore growth defects and enhance crop yield, offering a strategy for breeding high-yield plants. 
 New tissues and organs in plants develop from stem cells located in meristematic tissues. Cell wall-mediated mechanics has been proposed to play crucial roles in controlling stem cell activity. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis shoot apical meristems (SAMs) Cellulose Synthase Like-D5 (CSLD5)-mediated cell wall synthesis modulates tissue mechanics. The Myb-domain transcription factor MYB3R4 directly activates CSLD5 expression, leading to robust new cell wall synthesis in dividing cells. CSLD5 forms complexes with CESAs to guide cellulose-based wall construction. Disruption of CSLD5 results in reduced wall stiffness and altered expression of touch-responsive genes. Confining CSLD5 to L1 layer cells restores the mechanical properties and growth defects of csld5 SAMs, indicating molecular and cellular compensation across shoot meristem layers. We further demonstrate that epidermal expression of OsCSLD4 in rice enhances inflorescence meristem growth and seed production. Our results suggest a principle for breeding high yield crops through cell-type specific cell wall remodelling.

Mechanically, MSX2 protects PU.1 from FBXW7 mediated degradation and targeting Msx2 serves as an anabolic therapy in pre-clinical models of osteoporosis. 
 Highly conserved homeobox genes are closely related to bone formation during embryogenesis, while their role in adult bone resorption remains unclear. In this study, we found that the homeobox gene MSX2 actively participates bone metabolism. Myeloid-specific Msx2 deficiency safeguards bone mass under physiological and pathological conditions. Loss of Msx2 acts as a “brake” in the fusion fate of osteoclasts, resulting in a larger population of pre-osteoclasts. Pre-osteoclasts secrete platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), which promotes angiogenesis-mediated bone formation. Mechanistically, MSX2 directly binds to the vital osteoclastogenic transcription factor PU.1 and protects it from FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination degradation. Msx2 and Fbxw7 double knockout mitigated the protective effect of MSX2 deficiency on bone mass. Finally, we identified a natural compound, morusinol, that specifically destroys the combination of MSX2 and PU.1, promoting PU.1 degradation and attenuating ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Overall, our results demonstrate that targeting Msx2 is a promising anabolic therapy for osteoporosis.

It shows that TOP2α must load at DNA crossovers, becomes inefficient above 28pN of force, and that cohesin inhibits decatenation on DNA braids. 
 Human topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2α) resolves DNA intertwines between sister chromatids during mitosis. How cohesin, an SMC complex that holds sister chromatids, affects TOP2α decatenation is unclear. To addres this, we developed a quadruple-trap optical tweezers assay to create DNA braids and study TOP2α decatenation at the single-molecule level in real-time. We show that TOP2α resolves both single and multiple braids but becomes inefficient at forces exceeding 28 pN. TOP2α is sensitive to DNA geometry, exhibiting a chiral preference for right-handed braid crossings, and requires loading directly at DNA crossovers to act. Pre-loading TOP2α onto individual DNA strands before braid formation, in the presence of ATP, prevents decatenation. Finally, we show that human cohesin, but not condensin I, binds stably to DNA braids and blocks TOP2α activity. Our study provides novel insights into the role of substrate accessibility in regulating TOP2α‘s activity and highlights cohesin as a barrier to decatenation.

Here, the authors show that DDX41 resolves G-quadruplex structures to maintain erythroid genome stability and prevent cGAS-mediated cell death. These functions are lost in disease-associated variants. 
 Deleterious germline DDX41 variants constitute the most common inherited predisposition disorder linked to myeloid neoplasms (MNs), yet their role in MNs remains unclear. Here we show that DDX41 is essential for erythropoiesis but dispensable for other hematopoietic lineages. Ddx41 knockout in early erythropoiesis is embryonically lethal, while knockout in late-stage terminal erythropoiesis allows mice to survive with normal blood counts. DDX41 deficiency induces a significant upregulation of G-quadruplexes (G4), which co-distribute with DDX41 on the erythroid genome. DDX41 directly binds to and resolves G4, which is significantly compromised in MN-associated DDX41 mutants. G4 accumulation induces erythroid genome instability, ribosomal defects, and p53 upregulation. However, p53 deficiency does not rescue the embryonic death of Ddx41 hematopoietic-specific knockout mice. In parallel, genome instability also activates the cGas-Sting pathway, impairing survival, as cGas deficiency rescues the lethality of hematopoietic-specific Ddx41 knockout mice. This is supported by data from a DDX41-mutated MN patient and human iPSC-derived bone marrow organoids. Our study establishes DDX41 as a G4 resolvase, essential for erythroid genome stability and suppressing the cGAS-STING pathway.

 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) α-synuclein (α-syn) seed amplification assays (SAAs) can detect Lewy body pathology (LBP) with high accuracy but are invasive and costly. To address these challenges, this study evaluated a two-step workflow combining prescreening via smell-function testing with confirmatory CSF α-syn SAA testing only in individuals with reduced smell, for predicting postmortem LBP status. Among 358 autopsied participants, the two-step workflow predicted brain LBP with high accuracy overall (94%), and within clinical subgroups (clinical parkinsonism=95%; clinical Alzheimer’s disease [AD]=94%; clinically unimpaired [CU]=93%). It reduced the need for confirmatory CSF testing by 43% overall (23% clinical parkinsonism; 35% clinical AD; 80% CU). In an independent in vivo cohort (N=1209), the workflow predicted CSF α-syn SAA status with 79% accuracy and reduced CSF testing by 26%.

 Ribosomes are RNA-protein complexes essential for protein synthesis and quality control. Traditional methods for ribosome isolation are labor-intensive, expensive, and require a substantial amount of biological material. In contrast, our method, RNA affinity purification using poly-lysine (RAPPL), provides a rapid, simple, and cost-effective alternative applicable to various species and types of starting material (cell lysates, whole cells, organs, or whole organisms). It is also compatible with traditional isolation techniques. Here, we describe the use of RAPPL for rapid isolation, functional screening, and structural analysis of ribosomes and associated factors. We also demonstrate the application of RAPPL in investigating ribosome-associated resistance mechanisms in uropathogenic Escherichia coli samples and generating a 2.7-Å cryoEM ribosome structure from Cryptococcus neoformans. By significantly reducing the amount of the starting biological material and the time required for isolation, RAPPL has the potential to facilitate the study of ribosomal function, interactions, and antibiotic resistance and provide a versatile platform for academic, clinical, and industrial research.

 The likelihood of intense heatwaves in South Asia is increasing due to climate change, highlighting the need to understand their evolving spatiotemporal patterns. Using a complex network-based approach, we analyze synchronous extreme heat events across South and West Asia over three 30-year periods: two historical phases (1960–1989, 1990–2019) and a near-future projection (2020–2049) under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. Our findings reveal a shift in heatwave synchronization from western and central Asia before 1990 towards Pakistan, northwest India, and the southwestern Tibetan Plateau by the mid-21st century. This shift is primarily driven by increased surface sensible heat flux, which enhances atmospheric diabatic heating and strengthens the early-summer circumglobal teleconnection. Additionally, atmospheric conditions over the North Atlantic-Greenland sector modulate South Asian heatwave synchronization.

 The persistent increase in heatwaves has caused substantial economic and ecological damage. However, the contribution of decadal oceanic variability to the recent surge in heatwaves remains unclear. Here, using observations and simulations, we demonstrate that oceanic modulation drives decadal heatwave swings and trends. We quantify that the decadal component of heatwave cumulative intensity (HWCI) accounts for 57% of the observed increase in HWCI across the Northern Hemisphere from 2013 to 2021, with 44% attributed to increases in the smoothed component (HWCIS) and 13% to enhancements in the anomaly component (HWCIA). Notably, decadal oceanic variability contributed to 63% of the HWCI increase in the Northern Hemisphere during 2013–2021 and to 26% over 1985–2021. Regionally, oceanic modulation amplified HWCI by 58% in Europe, and contributed more than 20% in North Africa, southern North America, eastern China, and northern Central Asia during 2013–2021. The positive-to-negative phase transitions of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) were identified as key drivers of this recent intensification. Model simulations incorporating AMO and IPO forcings closely align with observed HWCI decadal oscillations since 1940, further supporting these findings. Our results highlight that oceanic modulation can significantly amplify or dampen human-induced long-term heatwave trends, suggesting a potential slowdown in heatwave intensification in the coming decades as oceanic variability transitions to a new phase."

 Following a disaster, responders need to rapidly assess the extent of the damage. The prevailing view is that very-high-resolution optical satellite images can provide more accurate estimates of building damage than lower-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, we demonstrate that SAR-based damage proxy maps we produced after the 2023 Kahramanmaraş Türkiye earthquakes outperformed comparable maps derived from optical imagery. This finding held true for both a state-of-the art machine learning method and for visual interpretation. The SAR-based maps achieved an F1 performance score approximately twice as high as the optical-based maps (0.47 vs 0.24, 0.23 and 0.15). Additionally, SAR offers established advantages in both coverage and timeliness: SAR was able to image the entire affected area within ten days, whereas the very-high-resolution optical dataset covered only 5.4% of the SAR-covered area during the same timeframe. Using the largest ground dataset that we know of for any event, we show that the damage distribution captured by our SAR-based maps strongly correlates with the ground observations over a wide range of spatial scales from neighbourhoods (~1 km2) to provinces (~10,000 km2). Based on this experience, we argue that any reliable remote sensing-based damage assessment system should incorporate radar to complement other techniques.

 Landslides regulate the height of mountains by releasing potential energy and reducing topographic relief. Yet, relief also limits the dimensions of small, frequent landslides in turn. But how local topography, lithology, and climate influence the size distribution and hazard of Earth’s largest terrestrial landslides remains unclear. Here we use Bayesian regression to estimate these effects on landslide volume, drawing on a worldwide sample of 411 cases, each involving > 1 km3. Nearly two third of their total volume is volcanic and sedimentary rocks within 50 km of active fault zones, clustered in actively uplifting mountain belts and on volcanic plateaus. Volumetric estimates vary most distinctly with dominant topographic setting, regardless of local relief, general rock type, or contemporary climate. These largely negligible effects indicate that volume scaling statistics fail to capture differing bulk lithological properties, let alone a detection bias due to climatic controls on land cover, weathering, or erosion.

We show that the devices perform differently in the six dimensions. Major challenges for the alkaline electrolyser are resource depletion pressure and substitutability, while the challenge for polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysers is the supply disruption risk. Regarding solid oxide electrolysers, challenges are identified in supply disruption risk, resource depletion pressure, and circularity dimensions.

 Seasonal phytoplankton blooms in Greenland’s coastal waters form the base of marine food webs and contribute to oceanic carbon uptake. In Qeqertarsuup Tunua, West Greenland, a secondary summertime bloom follows the Arctic spring bloom, enhancing annual primary productivity. Emerging evidence links this summer bloom to subglacial discharge from Sermeq Kujalleq, the most active glacier on the Greenland Ice Sheet. This discharge drives localized upwelling that may alleviate nutrient limitation in surface waters, yet this mechanism remains poorly quantified. Here, we employ a high-resolution biogeochemical model nested within a global state estimate to assess how discharge-driven upwelling influences primary productivity and carbon fluxes. We find that upwelling increases summer productivity by 15–40% in Qeqertarsuup Tunua, yet annual carbon dioxide uptake rises by only  ~3% due to reduced solubility in plume-upwelled waters. These findings suggest that intensifying ice sheet melt may alter Greenland’s coastal productivity and carbon cycling under future climate scenarios.

Regional and material disparities persist, highlighting that no single mitigation pathway can uniformly protect all sites.

 Around 80% of the world’s hard-rock lithium supply comes from pegmatites formed in the Archean Eon, yet our understanding of how Lithium-pegmatites form assumes magma source compositions not relevant to those Archean cratons hosting most of the giant Lithium-pegmatites. These models emphasize extraction of residual pegmatitic liquids from granitic magmas formed through melting sedimentary sequences. However, there is no evidence that such sequences provided the source to Lithium-rich granites and related giant Lithium-pegmatites in the Archean cratons of Western Australia. Economically important Lithium-pegmatites in these terrains form near faulted contacts between regional granites and basalt-dominated greenstone belts. Where spatially associated granites are Lithium-rich, they also contain unusually radiogenic Neodymium, resembling earlier, but spatially associated hydrated high-Magnesium diorites of mantle origin (sanukitoid). Intrusion of sanukitoids along crustal-scale structures prior to granitic magmatism induced Lithium-rich biotite alteration of the felsic basement beneath greenstone belts. Analogous to melting metasomatized lithospheric mantle to produce sanukitoids, melting of sanukitoid-infused basement beneath greenstone roots produced Lithium-rich granites and ultimately Lithium-pegmatite. Melting buried metasediments might produce Lithium-pegmatites, but most of the world’s giant Lithium-pegmatites formed along major crustal boundaries in response to the transfer of hydrous mantle-derived magma from metasomatized deep lithospheric domains in the Archean. Melting of sanukitoid-infused basement beneath greenstone roots produced lithium-rich granites and lithium-pegmatite in the Australian Archean Cratons, according to an analysis of geochemical and isotopic data."

 Vegetation is the basic component of wetland ecosystems. Monitoring changes in aboveground biomass (AGB) of wetland vegetation is crucial for understanding the response of wetland ecosystems to global climate change. China has vast wetlands experiencing diverse climate change impacts. However, how the AGB of wetland vegetation responds to climate change and human impacts remains unclear. This lack of understanding stems from insufficient in-situ observations, complex interactions between wetland vegetation growth and local hydrology, and challenges in estimating AGB using remote sensing data alone. Here, we compiled a wetland AGB dataset with 1087 sites covering all wetland regions in China (639 sample points from field sampling and 448 sample points from literature). Based on this dataset, we mapped the spatial distribution of wetland AGB in China using machine learning algorithms to understand its historical and future changes. The wetland AGB density of China in 2020 was 352.23 ± 32.67 g C m−2 on average and the total wetland AGB stock was 57.51 ± 6.36 Tg C. During the past two decades (2000–2023), wetland AGB has gradually increased, indicating a notable greening trend in China’s wetlands. Our results project that China’s wetlands could continue to green-up rapidly and sustainably under various future climate change scenarios, but with varying degrees of greening. This highlights the difference in wetland ecosystem response to various climate conditions.

 Amazon freshwater systems influence global hydroclimatic patterns, host unparalleled biological diversity, and support unique social-ecological systems. Rivers of the Western Amazon underpin this global importance with an outsized, underrecognized role at the Amazon Basin scale. Here we examined the status of several components—hydrology, sediments, freshwater fish biodiversity, and longitudinal river connectivity—that support the ecological integrity of Western Amazon rivers and their linkage to the greater Amazon Basin. Streamflow is largely driven by precipitation and the region supplies nearly all sediments delivered by the Amazon River to the Atlantic Ocean. The Western Amazon harbors 74% of the ichthyofauna of the entire Amazon Basin. Existing dams and road crossings have disrupted longitudinal river connectivity on several rivers. We estimated that 47.8 million people reside in the Amazon Basin, with more than half (58%) inhabiting the Western Amazon.

 Vegetation indices (VIs) are widely employed in remote sensing for quantitative monitoring of plant disease due to their simplicity and robustness. However, factors such as canopy structure, the distribution of diseases in the canopy, and observation geometry may influence the spectral response of diseased canopies, potentially affecting the performance of VIs developed under specific disease conditions (e.g., early-stage). To date, fewer comprehensive analytical strategy has been proposed to quantitatively assess the confounding effects of multiple factors, which has hindered the selection of optimal VIs for practical disease monitoring. This study proposes an integrated analytical strategy that combines a three-dimensional radiative transfer model (3D RTM) with a multi-criteria decision-making method — entropy-weighted Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) — to systematically evaluate existing disease-related VIs at the canopy scale, based on simulation outputs and ground measurements. We employed the LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation framework (LESS) to simulate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) of canopies affected by two representative apple diseases, quantitatively evaluated the confounding effects of tree shape, disease distribution and observation geometry on VIs, and systematically ranked the performance of 40 VIs from two critical perspectives. Results from analyses on two disease types showed that Health Index 2014 (HI2014) and Water Band Index in SWIR (WBISWIR) were the top-performing indices for monitoring apple blotch disease (AMB) and apple mosaic disease (MD), respectively, Notably, WBISWIR emerged as the co-optimal index, exhibiting the highest monitoring efficacy across both diseases. Among all indices, the Normalized PRI (PRIn) demonstrated the greatest robustness against variations in tree shapes and disease distributions. WBISWIR exhibited good performance across diverse observation geometries. When comparing the relative influence of three factors on VI performance, tree shape and disease distribution exerted greater effects than observation geometry. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between VIs and confounding factors, emphasizing the necessity of caution when applying disease-related VIs and advocate for comprehensive consideration of tree shape and stress distribution effects during VI selection, especially for early-stage disease detection. This study offers a robust methodological framework for selecting VIs tailored to specific disease and vegetation characteristics, enhancing the precision of remote sensing-based plant disease assessments."

 Early aftershock sequences and afterslip provide key insights into crust rheology and the triggering mechanisms of seismicity sequences. Three recent moderate-large strike-slip earthquakes in eastern Tibet, including the 2021 Yangbi Mw 6.1, the 2021 Maduo Mw 7.4, and the 2022 Menyuan Mw 6.4 events, provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the driving processes of aftershocks and the regional crustal rheology. In this study, we inverted for the early afterslip and statistically analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution of these three aftershock sequences. Our results reveal a significant spatial complementarity between the relocated aftershocks, coseismic slip and early afterslip, suggesting aftershocks were triggered by afterslip driven by the coseismic stress changes. The depth of the aftershock sequences consistently shallows over time, which we interpret as a transient response of the brittle-ductile transition zone to early postseismic relaxation. For the first time, we quantify the depth-dependent variations of aftershock-derived rheological and frictional parameters along these three strike-slip faults in eastern Tibet. The recurrence times derived from early aftershocks are generally shorter than those estimated from geodetic or geological data, demonstrating that fault loading rates are not constant throughout the seismic cycle. This spatiotemporal comparison between aftershocks, coseismic slip and afterslip allows for the discrimination of different aftershock driving mechanisms. The framework presented here is generalized to other similar tectonic settings, providing a method to identify the dominant aftershock driving mechanism and to constrain the rheological properties, frictional parameters and recurrence times of regular earthquakes."

 Desertification threatens global ecosystems and land productivity, making timely monitoring essential for ecological protection and sustainability. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is widely used to assess land surface ecological quality (LSEQ), but its instability in time-series analysis remains a challenge. This study investigates the causes of RSEI instability and proposes an improved time-series-based TRSEI model for LSEQ monitoring. Additionally, dynamic time warping (DTW) is used to identify the most representative season, simplifying calculations. Geodetector is applied to analyze the main driving forces of LSEQ change. The results show that the normalized RSEI remains relatively stable in representing LSEQ over individual periods, but its stability is compromised due to the influence of extreme values introduced during normalization. In contrast, the proposed TRSEI preserves the purity of each pixel’s information, thereby enabling a more accurate reflection of ecological changes by transferring normalization and principal component analysis (PCA) from the spatial to the temporal scale. The DTW analysis reveals that the TRSEI trend in autumn closely mirrors interannual changes, making autumn the best season for representing ecological variation in desert regions. However, summer, along with changes in dryness, emerged as the dominant factor driving LSEQ variations. Overall, the TRSEI time-series analysis provides a more reliable method for dynamic monitoring of the LSEQ, offering stronger support for decision-making in ecological protection and sustainable development."

 Accurate and fine-grained crop yield prediction plays a crucial role in advancing global agriculture. However, the accuracy of pixel-level yield estimation based on satellite remote sensing data has been constrained by the scarcity of ground truth data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called the Multi-Task Crop Yield Prediction Network (MT-CYP-Net). This framework introduces an effective multi-task feature-sharing strategy, where features extracted from a shared backbone network are simultaneously utilized by both crop yield prediction decoders and crop classification decoders with the ability to fuse information between them. This design allows MT-CYP-Net to be trained with extremely sparse crop yield point labels and crop type labels, while still generating detailed pixel-level crop yield maps. Concretely, we collected 1859 yield point labels along with corresponding crop type labels and satellite images from eight farms in Heilongjiang Province, China, in 2023, covering soybean, maize, and rice crops, and constructed a sparse crop yield label dataset. MT-CYP-Net is compared with three classical machine learning and deep learning benchmark methods in this dataset. Experimental results not only indicate the superiority of MT-CYP-Net compared to previous methods on multiple types of crops but also demonstrate the potential of deep networks on precise pixel-level crop yield prediction, especially with limited data labels."

 Accurate crop type classification remains challenged by dependence on ground-based samples and the presence of ‘salt-and-pepper’ noise.

 The heterogeneous conversion of SO2 plays a crucial role in atmospheric sulfate formation. In recent years, it has been recognized that light-absorbing brown carbon can generate reactive oxygen species and enhance the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. However, the influence of atmospheric brown carbon on the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 on mineral oxide surfaces has not yet achieved sufficient attention. In this study, the impact of imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (2-IC), a ubiquitous atmospheric brown carbon, on the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 on hematite particle surfaces was investigated in the absence and presence of simulated solar irradiation by using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Results indicated that 2-IC can significantly influence the heterogeneous reactivities of hematite. Under dry conditions, the heterogeneous reactivities decreased with the increase of the loaded 2-IC mass fraction in the absence of light, but in the presence of light, the higher reactivities were observed at an appropriate mass fraction range of 2-IC when compared to pure hematite, showing the promoting effects in this mass fraction range. Under the condition of 58 % relative humidity, the heterogeneous reactivities in the absence of light decreased with the increasing mass fractions of 2-IC, and pure hematite showed the highest reactivity. However, in the presence of light, the heterogeneous reactivities increased first and then decreased with the increasing mass fractions of 2-IC, and the mixture containing 1 × 10−4 % 2-IC showed the highest reactivity. Water molecules can renew surface reactive sites and facilitate the photosensitization reaction of 2-IC, and further enhance sulfate formation. A possible mechanism for the impact of 2-IC on the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 on hematite is proposed.

 The higher particulate matter (PM) level in Delhi presents a significant health hazard, emphasizing the need for innovative metrics that precisely capture its potential health impacts. This study investigates oxidative potential (OP) as a health-relevant metric. OP showed a significant variability across particle sizes (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) and their sources. Notably, OPv (volume normalized) surpassed OPm (mass normalized), suggesting a strong correlation of OP with aerosol composition and their sources (R2 > 0.6–0.76). The hazard index (HI) was notably higher for fine particles (PM1, PM2.5: 3.48 ± 2.09–9.28 ± 5.58) compared to PM10 (2.27 ± 1.01–5.05 ± 2.24). Chemical analysis of non-refractory PM1 revealed organic aerosols as the predominant constituents, followed by nitrate (NO3−) and sulfate (SO42−), while chloride (Cl−) being the least abundant. The elevated NO3− levels were attributed to the oxidation of SO42− in ammonium-rich environments, supported by sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) and nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR). Primary organic carbon (POC) significantly exceeded (2–4 times) secondary organic carbon (SOC) and charred elemental carbon (Char-EC) being more abundant in PM2.5 than soot-derived elemental carbon (Soot-EC), insightful for combustion processes. A comparison of OP with the Air Quality Index (AQI) and HI revealed that days categorized as having satisfactory air quality exhibited unexpectedly high both OP, comparable to days classified as very poor/severe AQI. This suggests that OP is an independent parameter influenced by various factors, including exposure level, chemical composition, inhalation rates, and aerosol characteristics. The OPv demonstrated significant correlations with measured parameters (R2: 0.54–0.86), particularly with primary aerosols (R2: 0.68–0.76), while showing weaker correlations with secondary aerosols (R2: 0.32–0.52). In contrast, OPm exhibited negative correlations (R2: −0.11 to −0.50), likely due to chemical species which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The MIR values exhibited strong correlations across all seven observations (r = 0.98–0.99), with C4–C5 internal alkenes showing the highest MIR values (22.5–87.1 μg O3 μg−1). Nonetheless, substantial variability of MIR values existed across different observations, as ratios relative to the Beijing 2016 observation of 0.6–1.45. Potential causes for the observed MIR variability included variations in photolysis rate and the fraction of reactive NMHCs across different observations, as well as the treatment of carbonyls in MIR calculations. Compared to values derived under U.S. atmospheric conditions, our calculated MIR values for internal alkenes were higher, while those for low-reactivity species were lower, suggesting a broader range of MIR values for various NMHCs in this study. While OFP values calculated with our localized MIR values generally correlated well with those using U.S. MIR values in six observations, applying U.S. MIR values to assess OFP in China might overestimate alkane contributions and underestimate those of alkenes (especially isoprene and C4–C5 anthropogenic alkenes) to O3 formation. These findings underscore the importance of utilizing region-specific MIR values for the accurate identification of key O3 precursors and the implementation of effective regulatory measures."

 Toluene and α-pinene are typical anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds, respectively, which can contribute to urban fine particles through photochemical processes. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the formation and composition of SOA and possible interactions in mixed toluene-α-pinene systems. A high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer was used to determine the composition of SOA in the toluene-α-pinene mixed system. The results showed that the α-pinene-O3 channel was dominant in forming SOA from mixed system. Since α-pinene has a higher rate constant with OH radical than toluene, the consumption of toluene was reduced by 35 % due to competition from α-pinene. New products were found in mixed system based on SOA mass spectra, and the signal fraction of C15 ∼ 20 oligomers (3.7 ± 0.6 %) was higher than that of individual toluene system (0.7 ± 0.1 %) and individual α-pinene system (1.6 ± 0.2 %); The range of H/C and O/C ratios of SOA molecules from mixed system was similar to the individual α-pinene system, further show that the mixed SOA mainly from O3 channel oxidation of α-pinene. The average Carbon Oxidation State (OSC) of the mixed system is −0.2, lying between the individual toluene system (0.2) and individual α-pinene system (−0.3), which approaches the α-pinene system. Four cross-products (C15H18O8 (MW 326), C15H20O8 (MW 328), C17H22O8 (MW 354), and C17H24O8 (MW 356)) from interactions in the oxidation of precursors were identified, which were formed by the toluene-RO2 and α-pinene-RO2 reaction. Our study highlights the need for more investigations on mixtures of VOCs from different sources."

Bhushan,Inter-annual variability in sources and characteristics of carbonaceous aerosols using dual carbon isotopes over a megacity in eastern India,"•Carbonaceous aerosols (CA) contribute significantly to PM2.5over Kolkata, accounting for 41 ± 11 %. •CA is dominated by biomass-burning and biogenic sources, contributing approximately 69 ± 4 %. •Surface CA over Kolkata are primarily from local sources. •Radiative effect of methanol-soluble brown carbon is three times higher than water soluble fraction. 
 This study investigates the inter-annual variability of carbonaceous aerosols (CA) over Kolkata, a megacity in eastern India, using dual carbon isotopes (14C and 13C) alongside measurements of the optical properties of brown carbon (BrC). Sampling was conducted during the post-monsoon, winter, and spring seasons over two consecutive years (2020–21 and 2021–22). The analysis reveals that PM2.5 and CA concentrations were higher in 2020–21 (194 ± 40 and 54 ± 15 μg m−3, respectively) compared to 2021–22 (141 ± 31 and 44 ± 21 μg m−3), likely due to higher precipitation in 2021–22. The contribution of biomass burning and biogenic sources to CA (fbio_TC) was slightly higher in 2020–21 (70 ± 3 %) than in 2021–22 (68 ± 3 %), with both years exhibiting a consistent decreasing trend from post-monsoon to spring. Observed lower values for oxidised CA proxies, such as the WSOC/OC ratio (0.41 ± 0.08) and AMS-derived f44 (0.13 ± 0.02), throughout the study period suggest that surface CA over Kolkata primarily originates from local sources rather than long-range transport. The relative radiative forcing (RRF) also showed a clear reduction in the subsequent year; however, on average, the RRF of methanol-soluble BrC (16 ± 6 %) was approximately three times higher than that of the water-soluble fraction (5.5 ± 2.2 %), highlighting the substantial role of BrC in influencing regional radiative forcing. These findings underscore the substantial impact of local emissions over transported pollutants on Kolkata's ground-level air quality."
