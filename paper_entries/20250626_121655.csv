Here, we derive streamflow sensitivity regimes from long-term observations in the Swiss Alps and analyse their potential controls. For each week of the year, we estimated absolute and relative sensitivities of streamflow in response to changes in temperature, precipitation, and storage. At high elevations with extensive glacier cover, weekly temperature and precipitation sensitivities peak in spring and summer when melt rates are high. At low elevations with no glacier cover, weekly temperature sensitivities are negative in summer, while precipitation sensitivities are highest under moist winter conditions. The elevation at which temperature sensitivities switch from positive to negative changes over the course of the year, showing that the sensitivities are temperature-dependent and thus non-stationary. Weekly streamflow sensitivities help resolve the seasonally-varying drivers of the streamflow regime and may be used to evaluate hydrological models."

Evidence from China,"Environmental policies are a primary tool for governments to address environmental issues, yet their effectiveness remains debated. This study examines the direct and indirect effects of regional environmental policies on environmental efficiency. Based on the environmental policies collected from 150 official websites, the environmental policy intensity (EPI) and convergence of 30 Chinese regions are quantified by text mining methods, and the Spatial Durbin Model is employed to investigate the direct and spillover effects of environmental policies on environmental performance. The results indicate that regional environmental policy convergence (EPC) has statistically significant and positive direct and spillover effects. Conversely, stricter EPI tends to hinder sustainability in both local and neighboring regions. Furthermore, empirical analysis demonstrates that EPC generates significantly greater positive impacts than the suppressive effects caused by policy intensity, both in direct and spillover terms. These findings highlight the importance of inter-regional policy integration and offer new insights for regional environmental governance."

Climate change emergence is a key statistic used to quantify the impact of human activities on climate and inform climate change mitigation strategies. Previous studies determining when climate change has emerged, however, do not account for the combined uncertainty from historical observations and climate models. Here, we show that the emergence of regional warming is early, widespread, and robust to observational and model uncertainty. Warming has emerged over more than 90% of the global land surface as of 2020, and had emerged over more than 50% of the earth’s land surface by 2000. Emergence occurs despite observational and model uncertainty creating delays of more than 10 years over 75% of the land surface. These conclusions demonstrate that accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty is necessary for robust detection of climate change emergence."

It is found that models exhibit a large diversity in the western extension of the IPO, leading to distinct global impacts. The IPO-related sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies extend more westward to the equatorial western Pacific (WP) in the low-resolution (LR) models, along with a westward shift of atmospheric responses. However, such biases are largely reduced in the high-resolution (HR) models, ascribing to better behavior in reproducing the mean-state SST in the cold tongue. In general, the HR models simulate smaller zonal advection in the equatorial WP due to a weaker zonal SST gradient compared to the LR models. In addition to the tropics, the intensity of IPO-related SST over the North Pacific is also improved in the HR models due to their benefits in simulating the Kuroshio extension. These findings suggest that the HR models have superior capabilities in predicting and projecting future changes in the IPO."

Part of the problem is the existence of ‘hot spots’ of methane flux, which have not been clearly identified and studied at multiple scales. Methane has a short lifetime compared to carbon dioxide; thus, efforts to avoid methane hot spots from constructed wetlands can promptly decelerate the rate of atmospheric warming. In this study we measured methane fluxes using flux towers in a restored oligohaline wetland in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, where we previously identified a hot spot of methane flux using footprint-weighed flux maps and chambers. Our main objectives with this study were to determine why this hot spot occurs and what are the biogeochemical and microbiological conditions that lead to these high methane fluxes. We found four main mechanisms that explain the existence of the hot spot. (1) The hot spot was associated with areas where the water level was closer to the surface (2) Methane originated mostly from older unoxidized peat in deeper layers, which had a shorter migration pathway to the atmosphere at the hot spot location due to soil disturbance during wetland construction. (3) Relatively lower methane oxidation in the hot spot in the upper soil layer (10–30 cm under the surface), deduced from isotopic profiles in porewater carbon and upper-level methanotroph abundance. (4) Higher ebullition events at the hot spot that can be related to low water levels and lower bulk density throughout the soil profile. This study thus suggests that mitigating soil disturbances during wetland construction and managing water level can reduce the occurrence and magnitude of hot spots of methane flux in constructed wetlands."

Using observational datasets, we uncover significant multidecadal shifts in the northern and southern edges of the WPWP. Heat budget analysis based on century-long ocean model hindcast simulations reveals that the meridional displacements of the WPWP northern edge are mainly caused by surface heat flux variations, while the southern edge’s shifts can be primarily attributed to meridional oceanic heat advection associated with the wind-driven Ekman transport. These meridional movements largely covary with the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), expanding poleward during AMV’s ascending phases and contracting equatorward during descending phase. Multi-model idealized AMV± experiments estimate that trans-basin forcing of the AMV accounts for 47% ± 8% of the observed northern edge shifts and 26% ± 7% of the southern edge changes. Reducing model uncertainties in AMV teleconnections will help to better quantify their impacts on the Pacific decadal climate variability."

We found that the biogeographic Amazon is a net carbon sink, while the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes are net carbon sources, resulting in an overall neutral balance. Finally, to further reduce the uncertainty in our estimates we call for an expansion of the monitoring capacity, especially in the Amazon–Andes foothills. 
 In tropical South America there has been substantial progress in atmospheric monitoring capacity, but the region still has a limited number of continental atmospheric stations relative to its large area, hindering net carbon flux estimates using atmospheric inversions. In this study, we use dry-air CO2 mole fractions measured at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) and airborne vertical CO2 profiles in an atmospheric inversion system to estimate net carbon exchange in tropical South America from 2010 to 2018. Given previous knowledge of a bias due to undried samples in the airborne vertical profiles, we calculate the effect of this systematic uncertainty in our inverse estimates and propose a water-vapor correction to the airborne CO2 profiles. We focus our analysis on the biogeographic Amazon and its neighboring “Cerrado and Caatinga” biomes. Including the water-vapor correction changes the posterior ensemble median from −0.33 to −0.04 PgC yr−1 with a posterior uncertainty of 0.33 PgC yr−1 for the Amazon and for the Cerrado and Caatinga from 0.31 to 0.50 PgC yr−1, with an uncertainty of 0.24 PgC yr−1. Our estimates of carbon exchange include the contributions from both net vegetation exchange and release from fires. Assuming that the correction brings the observational data closer to the truth implies that the Amazon is a weaker sink of carbon and that the Cerrado and Caatinga is a larger source. We do not find a strong spatial shift of fluxes within the biogeographic Amazon due to the correction, nor do we find a strong impact on the interannual variations. Finally, to further reduce the uncertainty in regional carbon balance estimates in tropical South America, we call for an expansion of the atmospheric monitoring network on the continent, mainly in the Amazon–Andes foothills."

O'Meara;Gordon McFiggans;Dave Johnson;Hugh Coe,Determination of the atmospheric volatility of pesticides using Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols–chemical ionisation mass spectrometry,"This paper details a novel method of measuring the volatility of pesticides using the Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols coupled with a chemical ionisation mass spectrometer (FIGAERO-CIMS) calibrated using a set of poly(ethylene) glycols. This is compared to literature values and common models. The results show that the method used primarily matches current literature values. Additionally, a pesticide’s volatility as an indicator of the likelihood of atmospheric transport occurring is explored. 
 Pesticides have been found to be transported through the atmosphere away from fields after application. A key indicator of a pesticide's likelihood to reside in the atmosphere is its vapour pressure. Within this study we evaluate a novel method, the Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO) coupled with a chemical ionisation mass spectrometer, using a set of calibration compounds, polyethylene glycols (PEGs). Two methods of compound delivery onto the filter have been tested: atomisation and syringe deposition. Delivery results are consistent with previous studies, highlighting the lack of suitability of the syringe method. The successful calibration using the atomisation method was then used to determine the vapour pressure of six pesticides. This is the first time particle-phase pesticides have been measured with particle-phase chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CIMS). The pesticide volatilities were compared with widely accepted standard literature values used in industry, as well as values derived from a common environmental model frequently employed in industrial applications. Results showed that measurements from the FIGAERO-CIMS were consistent with reported literature values for some compounds, while others differed by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Determinations of dicamba, MCPA, and MCPP volatility using the FIGAERO-CIMS showed them to be semi-volatile, in agreement with literature values within 1 order of magnitude.  Mesotrione exhibited the largest difference in volatility, with the   FIGAERO-CIMS measuring a low volatility of 4.12×10-8Pa at 298 K (compared to a literature value of 5.7×10-6Pa). The difference for 2,4-D of 1 order of magnitude can be explained by the smaller particles deposited on the FIGAERO filter compared to the aerosolised PEG calibration particles, leading to evaporation at higher Tmax values and a lower measured vapour pressure and thus further supporting the conclusion that a calibration using the same particle size is required. The atmospheric implications of the pesticide volatilities are also discussed. A pesticide's volatility is often a key indicator of the likelihood of the potential for short- or long-range transport occurring, thus determining a pesticide's fate in the atmosphere and potential for environmental pollution from transportation in the air."

We use an AI scheme to achieve fast, accurate, and stable end-to-end simulation for full ACI within an atmospheric model, replacing numerical schemes. This innovation is expected to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of ACI simulations in climate models that would otherwise neglect or simplify ACI processes. 
 Simulating aerosol chemistry and interactions (ACI) is crucial in climate and atmospheric modeling, yet conventional numerical schemes are computationally intensive due to the stiff differential equations and iterative methods involved. While artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated  potential in accelerating photochemistry simulations, it has not been applied for simulating the full ACI processes, which encompass not only chemical reactions but also other processes, such as nucleation and coagulation. To bridge this gap, we develop a novel Artificial Intelligence Model for Aerosol Chemistry and Interactions (AIMACI), focusing initially on inorganic aerosols. Trained based on a conventional scheme, it has been validated in both offline and online modes (referring to whether it is coupled into a three-dimensional atmospheric model). Results demonstrate that AIMACI is not only comparable with  conventional schemes in spatial distributions, temporal variations, and evolution of particle size distribution of main aerosol species, including water content in aerosols, but also exhibits robust generalization ability, reliably simulating one month under different environmental conditions across four seasons despite being trained on limited data from merely 16 d. Notably, it exhibits ∼5× speedup with a single CPU and ∼277× speedup with a single GPU, compared with conventional schemes. However, the stability of AIMACI for year-scale global simulations remains to be seen, requiring further testing. AIMACI's generalization capability and its modular design suggest potential for future coupling to global climate models, which are expected to enhance the precision and efficiency of ACI simulations in climate modeling that neglects or simplifies ACI processes."

However, this relationship did not hold for agricultural soil extracts collected in the UK and Canada. To explain this difference, we propose that as the complexity of the sample increases, the hydrophobic interfaces in the bulk compete with the air–water interface. 
 Organic matter in agricultural soil dust can enhance dust's ice-nucleating ability relative to mineral dust and thus impact local cloud formation. But how is this organic matter able to nucleate ice? We hypothesised that hydrophobic interfaces, such as the air–water interface, influence how organic matter nucleates ice, which can be quantified by measuring surface tension. Here, we investigated correlations between surfactant properties and ice-nucleating activities of amphiphilic macromolecules common in agricultural soils and known ice nucleators, namely lignin and macromolecules from Snomax. Lignin and Snomax solutions were analysed using our droplet freezing technique, FINC, and an optical contact angle tensiometer. Results showed that lignin and Snomax solutions of increasing concentrations had increasing ice-nucleating activity and decreasing surface tension. In addition, high-speed cryo-microscopy of the same solutions revealed a preference for freezing at the air–water interface, consistent with these proxies being ice-active surfactants preferentially residing at the air–water interface, and thus hydrophobic surfaces. We then tested this relationship in field-collected agricultural soil extracts from the UK and Canada. Despite the trend observed for lignin and Snomax, there was no clear correlation between surface tension and freezing temperature of the soil extracts. This discrepancy may arise from the high complexity of the soil solutions, where hydrophobic interfaces in the bulk potentially compete with the air–water interface. Overall, we present further evidence of the role of hydrophobic interfaces in the heterogeneous ice nucleation of organic aerosols with implications for aerosol–cloud interactions."

Key findings include the extension of the N2O–∆′17O correlation to the upper troposphere and the identification of significant differences in the N2O–∆′17O slope in StratoClim samples. Additionally, the ∆′17O measurements are used to estimate global stratospheric production and surface removal of ∆′17O, providing an independent estimate of global vegetation CO2 exchange. 
 High-precision measurements of the triple oxygen isotope composition of CO2 (Δ′17O) can be used to estimate biosphere–atmosphere exchange of CO2, the residence time of tropospheric CO2, and stratosphere–troposphere exchange. In this study, we report measurements of  the Δ′17O(CO2) from air samples collected during two aircraft-based programmes, CARIBIC and StratoClim. CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) provided air samples from numerous transcontinental flights in  the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere region. StratoClim (Stratospheric and upper tropospheric processes for better climate predictions) conducted intensive campaigns with the high-altitude aircraft M55 Geophysica during the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone (ASMA), providing air samples from altitudes up to 21 km.Using high-precision Δ′17O measurements of the CARIBIC samples, we show that the N2O–Δ′17O correlation, previously observed in the stratosphere, extends to the upper troposphere. Moreover, we found no significant spatial or hemispheric differences in Δ′17O(CO2) for the upper-tropospheric samples collected during the CARIBIC programme. However, in many of the StratoClim samples, with significant stratospheric contributions, we observed a much lower N2O–Δ′17O slope compared to CARIBIC samples and previous publications. This deviation is attributed to change in eddy diffusion above the tropopause within the ASMA, confirming previously published model calculations. These samples provide the first experimental evidence that differences in vertical mixing/transport can lead to significantly different N2O–Δ′17O slopes. High-precision Δ′17O measurements can identify ejections of tropospheric air into the stratosphere based on the slope of the N2O–Δ′17O correlation, as both tracers have chemical lifetimes longer than their transport times.Furthermore, we use the Δ′17O measurements from the lower stratosphere and the upper troposphere to estimate global stratospheric production and surface removal of the isotope tracer Δ′17O. The removal estimate is then used to derive an independent estimate of global vegetation exchange of CO2, confirming earlier estimates based on surface level Δ′17O measurements."

This is the case for measurements of atmospheric water vapour using Raman lidar, which are of growing interest in the context of climate risks such as extreme precipitation. This study addresses this issue. It is based on six campaigns spread over a period of 7 years between 2016 and 2022. 
 Numerous field campaigns have been carried out to quantify the water vapour content of the atmosphere using vibrational Raman lidar technology. Each of them raises the question of calibration methods, in particular the reliability of this calibration over time. We present a study on the stability of the calibration of the WALI (Water vapour and Aerosol Lidar, now renamed Weather and Aerosol LIdar) lidar developed at Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (LSCE) in France, over a period of 7 years (2016–2022) and across several field campaigns. A calibration method is applied mainly using radiosondes and, in a few cases, airborne meteorological probes. Complementing the previous approaches, we show that ground-based meteorological measurements can be of great value for lidar calibration under conditions of vertical stability in the lower troposphere and provide good knowledge of the lidar overlap function, with full overlap within the planetary boundary layer. Using statistical criteria, we emphasize that these three calibration approaches should remain consistent over time. The observation periods considered here allow us to sample a wide range of water vapour contents in the lower troposphere, from 0.5 g kg−1 to more than 10 g kg−1, characteristic of the variabilities expected over the mid-latitudes and even over the Arctic. From comparisons between lidar and in situ measurements (radiosondes and/or flights), we observe a variability of more than 10 % in the calibration constant between field experiments conducted with and without laser injection seeding. The root mean square error between the lidar and in situ reference measurements is between 0.23 and 0.6 g kg−1, mainly due to the atmospheric variability during the calibration. The bias is small, less than 0.08 g kg−1. For all the situations studied, the correlation coefficient remains high, above 0.75. The instrumental error is comparable to the 0.4 g kg−1 recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Such a precision requires the use of a significant number of reference profiles,  and the remaining limitation is due to the uncertainties associated with in situ weather sensors. We note that the use of ground-based measurements does not introduce any more uncertainty in the lidar calibration coefficient than vertical profiles obtained by radiosondes or airborne means. Furthermore, the use of reanalyses can be an interesting option for calibration if the lidar profiles are not used in the models themselves, e.g. by means of assimilation."

Using machine learning, it identifies the most influential factors affecting soil DOC levels and maps global DOC patterns. The findings help guide soil management and climate strategies, with the dataset available for further research. 
 Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) constitutes the most active carbon pool in soils and plays critical roles in soil carbon cycling, plant productivity, and global climate change. Accurately assessing soil DOC quantity is essential to elucidate ecosystem functions and services. However, global driving factors and the spatial distribution of soil DOC remain poorly quantified, largely due to limited large-scale data. Here, we compile a comprehensive global database of soil DOC concentrations, encompassing 12 807 observations extracted from 975 scientific publications published between 1984 and 2020. We also record detailed geographic locations, climatic variables, and soil properties as predictors. Machine learning techniques were employed, including 10-fold cross-validation and evaluating model performance by R2 and root mean square error values, to predict the relative importance of various predictors and the global distribution of soil DOC concentrations. Worldwide soil DOC concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 7859 mg kg−1, averaging 222.78 mg kg−1. The 14 selected predictors, including elevation, soil properties, and climate, explained 63 % of the variance in soil DOC concentrations. Elevation played the most important predictor for soil DOC prediction, followed by soil organic carbon, seasonal variability of temperature, and soil clay content. Soil DOC decreases initially but increases when soil clay content exceeds 20 % and seasonal variability of temperature exceeds 0.7. Using these findings, a global map of predicted soil DOC concentrations was produced at a 0.05° by 0.05° resolution. Global soil DOC concentrations generally increased from the Equator to the poles wherein the topsoil layer (0–30 cm) holds 13.47 Pg of soil DOC with substantial variations across continents. These results inform soil management practices strategies, ecosystem services evaluations, and climate change mitigation efforts.

 3D geological models are an essential source of information for research as well as for the safe and efficient use of the underground. They provide not only a visualization of the subsurface structures, but also serve as geometry input for geophysical and numerical models, e.g., gravimetric, mechanical or thermal models. The set-up of a geological model for a numerical simulation is often a time-consuming task. During the last two decades several 3D geological models have been created for specific regions in Germany. However, up to now only one attempt has been made to combine several of them to a Germany-wide model. We present a new Germany-wide 3D geological model combining information of 27 individual models. The model has a resolution of 1x1 km2 and is vertically and horizontally subdivided into 146 units. Where possible, the model has been extended to neighbouring states, e.g., Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland or Austria. In order to combine all models with their different sizes, resolutions and stratigraphic subdivisions, a point-set approach was chosen which has a number of advantages with regard to the flexibility and usability. To demonstrate the usability, the set-up of a FE model is shown as a possible application."

However, few studies have addressed the challenges in the prior vertical structure. Different observations are assimilated to examine the sensitivity of assimilation to vertical structure. Results show that assimilation can optimize the dust field in general. However, if the prior introduces an incorrect structure, the assimilation can significantly deteriorate the integrity of the aerosol profile. 
 Modelling and observational techniques are pivotal in aerosol research, yet each approach exhibits inherent limitations. Aerosol observation is constrained by its limited spatial and temporal coverage compared to that of models. On the other hand, models tend to possess higher uncertainties and biases compared to observations. Aerosol data assimilation has gained popularity as it combines the advantages of both methods. Despite numerous studies in this domain, few have addressed the challenges faced in assimilating aerosol data with significant differences in magnitude and degree of freedom between the model state and observations, especially in the vertical direction. These challenges can lead to the preservation – or even the exacerbation – of structural inaccuracies within the assimilation process. This study investigates the sensitivity of dust aerosol data assimilation to the vertical structure of the aerosol profile. We assimilate a variety of dust observations, encompassing ground-based particulate matter (PM10) measurements, and satellite-derived dust optical depth (DOD) data, using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The assimilation process is elucidated, detailing the assimilation of raw ground-based and satellite-based observations for an optimized three-dimensional (3D) posterior state. To demonstrate the impact of accurate vs. erroneous prior aerosol vertical profiles on the assimilation result, we select three cases of super dust storms for analysis. Our findings reveal that the assimilation of ground observations would optimize the dust field at the ground in general. However, the vertical structure presents a more complex challenge. When the prior profile accurately reflects the true vertical structure, the assimilation process can successfully preserve this structure. Conversely, if the prior profile introduces an incorrect structure, the assimilation can significantly deteriorate the integrity of the aerosol profile. This is also found in the assimilation of DOD, which exhibits a comparable pattern in its sensitivity to the initial aerosol profile's accuracy."

Despite extensive investigations into how phosphorus poisoning leads to the deactivation of Cu/SSZ-13, effective strategies for regenerating catalysts with high phosphorus loading poisoned under practical conditions remain underdeveloped. In this study, we propose that incorporating Mg ions into Cu/SSZ-13 zeolites can significantly enhance their resistance and regeneration ability against phosphorus poisoning. After hydrothermal aging at 650 °C, the NH3–SCR activity of phosphorus-poisoned Cu/SSZ-13 catalysts with high phosphorus loading (0.6 mmol/gcat) cannot be effectively restored; however, the addition of Mg enables nearly complete recovery of their activity. Combining advanced microscopy evidence with complementary spectroscopy results, we reveal that Mg ions occupy the Brønsted acid sites in the six-membered rings (6-MRs) of SSZ-13, which regulates the distribution of subsequently introduced Cu ions while enhancing the stability of Cu2+ and the framework Al of SSZ-13, inhibiting the aggregation of Cu species after phosphorus poisoning and thereby improving resistance. Furthermore, the preservation of the SSZ-13 framework also effectively facilitates the redispersion of Cu species after hydrothermal aging, significantly restoring NH3–SCR performance."

In this study, an electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AneMBR) was developed to efficiently remove 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in wastewater while recovering chemical energy as methane. The average EE2 removal efficiency reached 83.1% in AneMBR, attributed primarily to significantly enhanced biodegradation, which demonstrates the advantages of this technology. The degradation kinetics results showed an 83.6% increase in the EE2 biodegradation rate by planktonic sludge under a 0.8 V electric field, along with enhanced sorption capacity, microbial activity, and c-type cytochrome secretion. The electric field provides supplemental energy for microbial metabolism, strengthens the conversion of EE2 into estradiol and estrone, and further converts them to low-endocrine-disrupting small-molecule organic compounds. These results were further confirmed by the upregulation of the functional genes involved in EE2 metabolism. This study develops a promising technology for improving SE removal in anaerobic methane fermentation systems and elaborates on the significance and metabolic mechanisms of planktonic sludge in electrically strengthened biotreatment systems for SE removal."

Airborne measurements during the 2023 Atmospheric Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas (AEROMMA) campaign investigated nonlinear O3 photochemistry in these cities. We report mean ozone production efficiency (OPE), the enhancement ratio of Ox (= O3 + NO2) to NOx oxidation products, of 9 ± 4 (1σ), 6 ± 3, and 6 ± 3 ppbv ppbv–1 in NYC, Chicago, and LA, respectively. Compared to historical values, OPE has increased in NYC but remains constant in LA. We find that OPE during AEROMMA has a nonlinear, inverse relationship with total reactive nitrogen (NOy, a proxy for initial NOx) and a positive correlation with the nonmethane VOC to NOy enhancement ratio. A zero-dimensional photochemical model supports these observed OPE dependences on NOx and VOCs and shows that OPE is a distinct metric from total O3 production that is informative to the development of O3 pollution control strategies. We find that OPE values have higher variability, and a larger increase with NOx emissions reductions, in areas that experience NOx-sensitive rather than NOx-saturated O3 photochemistry; nonetheless, NOx reductions under NOx-sensitive conditions still reduce total O3 production despite the corresponding increase in OPE."

CH4 emissions from reservoirs, characterized by ebullition and diffusion, primarily increase with temperature but are suppressed when reservoirs are frozen. However, these emissions are influenced not only by temperature but also by other conditions, making it difficult to understand with a single value of the CH4 emission factor provided by the IPCC. The CH4 emissions from the Yonghwasil Reservoir in South Korea were measured using the eddy covariance method to analyze their behavior under varying meteorological conditions. CH4 emissions were positively correlated with air temperature with negligible emissions observed at air temperatures below 8 °C. Therefore, CH4 emission rates during the summer season are significantly higher than those in winter. From August to October, more than 60% of CH4 was emitted as ebullition. In contrast, from November to January, total CH4 emissions decreased, with a resulting 80% from diffusion. Additionally, atmospheric pressure negatively influenced CH4 emission but was correlated with air temperature. Wind speed had no observable effect on CH4 emissions at low temperatures but contributed to increased emissions under high-temperature conditions."

However, comprehensive evaluations of three-dimensional models in simulating both nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and OVOCs remain scarce, hindering O3 control strategies. This study systematically evaluates the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQv5.3.3) using hourly observations from 12 monitoring sites across China from 2017 to 2021. Results reveal that the model underestimates NMHCs by 22.0% and OVOCs by 43.7%, on average. Within the 14 abundant OVOC components, formaldehyde (HCHO) and ketones (PRD2) show overpredictions, while other OVOCs are underpredicted (4.7–94.2%), with simulated OVOC contributions to total VOCs (8.8–36.7%) being substantially lower than observations (16.6–60.8%). The model exhibits persistent underestimation in daytime concentrations across seasons and shows stronger declines in daytime concentrations from nighttime peaks compared to observations, which suggests overestimated atmospheric physical diffusion or vertical mixing processes. Residual error analysis after subtracting the simulation bias of NMHCs (primarily attributed to biases in emissions and atmospheric physical processes) highlights inadequate secondary chemical formation as a major bias source for OVOCs. Sensitivity experiments demonstrate that conventional adjustments to boundary layer and surface parametrization schemes, minimum turbulent diffusivity (Kzmin), or primary emissions failed to resolve daytime OVOCs underestimation. On the contrary, adjusting eddy diffusivity values during the day, the local vertical gradient in an unstable atmospheric state, and the yield coefficient for OVOCs chemical formation effectively enhance the simulated daytime concentrations of OVOCs and reduce the model bias. This study highlights that better descriptions of the atmospheric diffusion or vertical mixing processes during the daytime and the secondary chemical formations of OVOCs should be prioritized to improve the performance of NMHCs and OVOCs modeling."

The DIC divergence results from the northward displacement of the DIC front associated with the northward‐shifted KE jet. Observations reveal that mesoscale warming contributes to accelerated surface winds, a feature not captured by the model."

Systems with river runoff and strong evaporation can form a salinity maximum between the freshwater sources and the adjacent ocean, a so‐called salt plug. In this study, we explore the diahaline overturning circulation and the associated diahaline mixing in the Persian Gulf as a representative salt plug estuary. The overturning structure combines features of classical and inverse estuaries: Salt mixing per salinity class is the product of salinity and river runoff at low salinities, and salinity and evaporation at the high salinities of the salt plugs. Overall, riverine freshwater and hypersaline water are transformed by mixing toward the salinity of the outflowing water. For the case of the Persian Gulf, the dynamically important separation of the surface and bottom layers in summer is highlighted by the overturning analysis."

The model well reproduces the seasonal lake thermodynamics, highlighting the phases of summer‐autumn warm thermal stratification, late‐autumn overturning, winter‐spring inverse thermal stratification, and late‐spring overturning. Heat budget analysis underscores the importance of lateral heat transport and ice freeze‐thaw processes in shaping the horizontal thermal variability. During 2007–2017, lake surface temperature, as well as the duration, onset and end of warm thermal stratification, show significant interannual variations related to the surface air temperature and ice conditions. During winter‐spring, the lake water flow speed shows strong interannual variability related to wind speed and ice conditions. Nevertheless, a consistent circulation pattern is found, featuring a dominant mid‐lake cyclonic gyre, upwelling along the western coast, and strong coastal currents driven by the prevailing southwesterly winds during December–January, followed by weakened lake water motions during February–April when the packed ice inhibits the wind stress input. In contrast, the summer‐autumn lake circulation is weaker but more variable, with the mid‐lake circulation shifting between being cyclonic (caused by the combined effects of southwesterly winds, positive wind stress curl and density effects) and occasionally anti‐cyclonic (due to the presence of negative wind stress curl)."

Surface spectral emissivity matters more in cold and dry environments than in hot and humid environments. Recent modeling studies confirmed that, for current climate simulations, this process affects the polar climate more than the extra‐polar climate. As for the Snowball Earth, a period characterized by global polar‐like conditions of extreme cold and low humidity, including surface spectral emissivity could alter the simulated global radiation budget. This, in turn, could affect the simulated climate of the Snowball Earth. Here, we use an aqua‐planet slab‐ocean simulation of Snowball Earth by the ICON model to perform offline radiative transfer calculations to quantify such impact on the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The offline radiative transfer model is used to compute the clear‐sky OLR for two surfaces that would be present in the extremely cold simulation: ice and snow. Compared to the results with assumed blackbody surface, the global mean OLR decreases by 2.9 and 1.0 W m−2 for ice and snow surfaces, respectively. The impact of surface spectral emissivity on the OLR is strongest at the equator and weakens toward the poles, presenting a noticeable meridional gradient. Effects of surface emissivity are also larger during the summer than the winter. The radiative effects of this often‐neglected process would be small for a snow‐covered globe but could be important for climate states with exposed ice, particularly Jormungand states, as well as simulations of other cold and dry climates."

We examine whether the use of spatial context — information about the local structure and organization of cloud features — can help overcome these limitations of IR channels and provide more accurate estimates of nighttime cloud optical properties. We trained several neural networks to emulate the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) NOAA Daytime Cloud Optical and Microphysical Properties (DCOMP) algorithm using only IR channels. We then compared the neural networks to the NOAA operational daytime and nighttime products, and the Nighttime Lunar Cloud Optical and Microphysical Properties (NLCOMP) algorithm, which utilizes the low‐light visible band on VIIRS. These comparisons show that the use of spatial context can improve estimates of nighttime cloud optical properties. The primary model we trained, U‐NetCOMP, can reasonably match DCOMP during the day and significantly reduces artifacts associated with day/night terminator. We also find that U‐NetCOMP estimates align more closely with NLCOMP at night compared to the nighttime NOAA operational products for ABI. Lastly, we perform a comparison with ground‐based instruments and find that U‐NetCOMP improves upon the nighttime operational product with some exceptions for thin cirrus clouds over cold surfaces."

For predicting the variability of wetland CH4 flux under warming, gross primary productivity (GPP) and LE, replacing wind direction (WD), were dominant variables for tropical swamps, while NEE was important for high‐latitude fens and bogs under warm temperatures. For wetland NEE, the role of TA and TS decreased across all wetland types with warming, while vapor pressure deficit (VPD) became more important for mid and high‐latitude wetlands.

Most Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models overestimate the short‐rain response to IOD events in Eastern Africa, especially during negative events. This is due to enhanced zonal moisture transport anomalies, mainly related to amplified IOD intensity and the westward extension of the IOD eastern core. Mean‐state precipitation biases further contribute to overestimated short rains, traced back to the mean‐state positive IOD‐like biases. Under global warming, the contrasting short‐rain responses to IOD in the Horn of Africa and Southeastern Africa are primarily driven by the westward‐shifting IOD circulation. Enhanced impacts in the Horn of Africa are driven by stronger IOD‐related zonal winds and the more humid mean‐state atmosphere which is attributed to the IOD‐like warming pattern. In contrast, weakened impacts in Southeastern Africa are associated with anomalous meridional wind changes. Additionally, due to more extreme negative IOD events, the frequency as well as severity of droughts in the Horn of Africa are projected to increase.

Data are integrated with sediment load, wave dynamics, sea level, and surface elevation to analyze drivers of wetland gain and loss. Results indicate a minor net change of only 1.21 km2, with a total gain of 160.83 km2 and a total loss of 159.62 km2. Overall stability of wetland area masks significant regional variability, with notable wetland expansion in the interior and substantial losses along eastern and southeastern margins. Sediment diversion toward the interior of the delta lead to distributaries narrowing (Main Pass and Pass a Loutre) that further hindered sediment‐laden water transport into deltaic margins. Wetland dynamics along the edges were closely linked to wave action, with large‐scale retreat in northern (4.0 ± 9.9 m/yr), eastern (58.0 ± 48.2 m/yr), and southeastern (38.6 ± 15.8 m/yr) regions, while progradation in the southern (13.6 ± 10.1 m/yr) and western areas (7.4 ± 19.4 m/yr).

With the intensification of droughts under climate change, understanding ecosystem responses to these events is essential. In this study, we analyzed the impacts of droughts on Net Primary Productivity (NPP) in India over the 21st century. We tested two hypotheses: (a) increasing drought intensity and frequency will exacerbate NPP reductions, and (b) climate warming will diminish ecosystem resilience, leading to greater NPP reductions per drought event. To evaluate ecosystem responses, we employed a Multi‐Dimensional Resilience Index (MDRI), which integrates resistance and recovery time to quantify resilience. Our analysis revealed a substantial increase in extreme and moderate droughts, while mild droughts remained stable. Extreme droughts were projected to cause NPP reductions three times greater under the SSP2‐4.5 scenario and six times greater under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario compared to the baseline period (1850–2014). Ecosystems in the Western Ghats and lower Himalayan regions demonstrated moderate resilience due to prolonged recovery times and moderate resistance. Conversely, ecosystems in Northeastern India exhibited high resilience, characterized by strong resistance and shorter recovery periods. Interestingly, while resistance exhibited an increasing trend, likely influenced by carbon fertilization, recovery times showed a declining trend, potentially linked to rising temperatures. These findings do not support the second hypothesis, as no significant changes in overall ecosystem resilience were observed due to compensatory effects between resistance and recovery.

Large‐scale DAC deployment, though, will require significant cost reductions in part through policy and investment support. This study evaluates the impact of policy interventions on DAC cost reduction by integrating energy system optimization and learning curve models. We examine how three policy instruments—incremental deployment, accelerated deployment, and R&D‐driven innovation—impact DAC learning investment, which is the total investment required until the technology achieves cost parity with conventional alternatives or target cost. Our findings show that while incremental deployment demands significant learning investment, R&D‐driven innovation is considerably cheaper at cost reduction. Under a baseline 8% learning rate, incremental deployment may require up to $998 billion to reduce costs from $1,154 to $400/tCO2, while accelerated deployment support could save approximately $7 billion on that investment. In contrast, R&D support achieves equivalent cost reductions at less than half the investment of incremental deployment. However, the effectiveness of R&D intervention varies with learning rates and R&D breakthroughs. R&D yields net benefits in all cases except at extremely low breakthroughs (5%) and very high learning rates (20%), where they are slightly more expensive. For learning rates below 20%, R&D provides net benefits even at minimal breakthroughs.

Here we compute the Time Of Emergence of vector density and of the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) in the SSP3‐7.0 scenario using 50 bias‐corrected members of Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble simulations. This reveals that vector density, which depends on climate conditions, and EIR, which depends on both climate and population density, will rise significantly and permanently above the pre‐industrial background variability due to anthropogenic causes in Africa. Both the vector density and EIR have areas, mainly in central Africa, where anthropogenic causes have already significantly changed, and many more areas will experience anthropogenic caused changes in the period 2030–2050 and toward the end of this century. Our simulations also show clear evidence that extremes of vector density and EIR increase in the future by almost 100%, suggesting that major malaria epidemic outbreaks will become much more likely. We also perform simulations with constant population and with no global warming which partly reveal underlying malaria dynamics. Our results highlight the need to prepare for an expansion and intensification of the malaria burden if no health interventions are being taken."

 Planets are thought to form from dust and gas in protoplanetary disks, with debris disks being the remnants of planet formation. Aged a few million up to a few billion years, debris disks have lost their primordial gas, and their dust is produced by steady-state collisions between larger, rocky bodies1,2. Tens of debris disks, with sizes of tens, sometimes hundreds, of astronomical units have been resolved with high-spatial-resolution, high-contrast imagers at optical and near-infrared or (sub)millimetre interferometers3,4. They commonly show cavities, ring-like structures and gaps, which are often regarded as indirect signatures of the presence of planets that gravitationally interact with unseen planetesimals2,5. However, no planet responsible for these features has been detected yet, probably because of the limited sensitivity (typically 2–10 MJ) of high-contrast imaging instruments (see, for example, refs. 6–9) before the James Webb Space Telescope. Here we have used the unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope’s Mid-Infrared Instrument10,11 in the thermal infrared to search for such planets in the disk of the approximately 6.4-Myr-old star TWA 7. With its pole-on orientation, this three-ring debris disk is indeed ideally suited for such a detection. We unambiguously detected a source 1.5 arcsec from the star, which is best interpreted as a cold, sub-Jupiter-mass planet. Its estimated mass (about 0.3 MJ) and position (about 52 au, de-projected) can thoroughly account for the main disk structures.

 Aggregation pheromone, 4-vinylanisole (4VA), is specifically released by gregarious migratory locusts, and is crucial in forming locust swarms that cause destructive plagues1. Control of locust plagues relies heavily on the extensive application of chemical pesticides, which has led to severe environmental and health issues2. As pheromones are primary mediators of insect communication and behaviour3, exploring their biosynthesis can provide important cues to develop innovative behavioural regulators, potentially reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Here we resolve the biosynthesis of 4VA and behavioural responses of locusts when enzymes in the 4VA biosynthetic pathway are manipulated. The process initiates with phenylalanine derived from food plants and proceeds through three precursors: cinnamic acid, p-hydroxycinnamic acid and 4-vinylphenol (4VP). Notably, the conversion from 4VP to 4VA through methylation is unique to gregarious locusts. This step is catalysed by two crucial methyltransferases, 4VPMT1 and 4VPMT2. Guided by the X-ray co-crystal structure of 4VPMT2 bound with 4VP and S-adenosyl-l-methionine, we developed 4-nitrophenol as a substrate surrogate. We identified several chemicals that can block 4VA production by inhibiting the enzymatic activities of 4VPMT proteins, thereby suppressing locust aggregative behaviour. The findings uncover the chemical logic behind 4VA biosynthesis and pinpoint two crucial enzymes as novel targets for locust swarm management. In locusts, the aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole is derived from dietary phenylalanine, and its production is dependent on two 4-vinylphenol methyltransferases that are potential targets for locust pest control."

 All-solid-state batteries require advanced cathode designs to realize their potential for high energy density and economic viability1–3. Integrated all-in-one cathodes, which eliminate inactive conductive additives and heterogeneous interfaces, hold promise for substantial energy and stability gains but are hindered by materials lacking sufficient Li+/e− conductivity, mechanical robustness and structural stability4–14.

Leveraging reversible Fe2+/Fe3+ redox and rapid Li+/e− transport within its framework, Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 achieves an electrode energy density of 529.3 Wh kg−1 versus Li+/Li. Critically, Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 shows unique dynamic properties during cycling, including reversible local Fe migration and a brittle-to-ductile transition that confers self-healing behaviour. This enables exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 90% capacity retention for 3,000 cycles at a rate of 5 C. Integration of Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 with a nickel-rich layered oxide further increases the energy density to 725.6 Wh kg−1.

 The broad bandgap tunability of both perovskites and organic semiconductors enables the development of perovskite–organic tandem solar cells with promising theoretical efficiency. However, the certified efficiencies of reported perovskite–organic tandem solar cells remain lower than those of single-junction perovskite solar cells, primarily because of insufficient near-infrared photocurrent in narrow-bandgap organic subcells1–3. Here we design and synthesize an asymmetric non-fullerene acceptor (NFA), P2EH-1V, featuring a unilateral conjugated π-bridge to reduce the optical bandgap to 1.27 eV while maintaining ideal exciton dissociation and nanomorphology. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms efficient hole transfer from P2EH-1V to the donor PM6.

 The dendritic cell (DC)-initiated and sustained cancer immunity cycle is indispensable for effective endogenous and therapeutically mobilized antitumour T cell responses1–8. This necessitates the continuous migration of antigen-carrying DCs from the tumour microenvironment (TME) to the tumour draining lymph nodes (tdLNs)7–13. Here, through longitudinal analysis of human and mouse tumours, we observed a progressive decrease in migratory conventional DCs (mig-cDCs) in the tdLNs during tumour progression. This decline compromised tumour-specific T cell priming and subsequent T cell supply to the TME. Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) and its substrate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as key modulators of DC migration. Advanced tumours disrupted cGMP synthesis in DCs to decrease their motility, while PDE5 perturbation preserved the cGMP pool to restore DC migration. Mechanistically, cGMP enhanced myosin-II activity through Rho-associated factors, extending the paradigm of cGMP-regulated amoeboid migration from Dictyostelium to mammalian immune cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 using sildenafil restored mig-cDC homing to late-stage tdLNs and sustained antitumour immunity in a DC-dependent manner. Our findings bridge fundamental DC interstitial motility to antitumour immunity, revealing that its disruption in chaotic TME promotes immune evasion, and its enhancement offers a promising direction for DC-centric immunotherapy.

 Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions within a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific concept1. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter, such as deconfined quark–gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions2 or expanding quantum degenerate gases3,4. Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges5,6, levitons7 and anyon statistics8. Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity9 as the number of interacting particles increases10 remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analysing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit at which the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet scattering experiments illustrate how coordinated behaviour emerges through interactions of only a few elementary constituents. Studying similar signatures in other physical platforms such as cold-atom simulators4,11 or collections of anyonic excitations8,12 may help identify emergence of exotic phases and, more broadly, advance understanding of matter engineering.

 Prevailing frameworks to address planetary environmental challenges tend to focus on setting goals, targets, or boundaries to limit human harm to ecosystems or species. Here we propose an aspirational approach aimed at empowering people to shape a better future for all of life on Earth. We do this by building on the human development approach and its supporting metrics, especially the Human Development Index (HDI), a broadly influential framework that has contributed to decades of human progress by measuring and promoting people’s capabilities to lead the lives that they value. Rather than assessing the state or dynamics of the biosphere, we propose the Nature Relationship Index (NRI), which would focus on measuring the progress of nations towards delivering mutually beneficial relationships among people and the rest of the living world in terms that people widely understand and value. Through an open-ended process informed by expert consultation, international concept testing and indicator development, the NRI could help to incentivize progress towards a world in which humanity thrives together with the rest of life on Earth. We explore the challenges and opportunities of developing a robust NRI and invite broader participation to facilitate this development in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report.

 The incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) enables customized chemistry to tailor protein functions1–3. Genetic code expansion offers a general approach for ncAA encoding by reassigning stop codons as the ‘blank’ codon; however, it is not completely orthogonal to translation termination for cellular transcripts. Here, to generate more bona fide blank codons, we developed an RNA codon-expansion (RCE) strategy that introduces and decodes bioorthogonally assignable pseudouridine (Ψ) codons (ΨGA, ΨAA or ΨAG) on specified mRNA transcripts to incorporate ncAAs in mammalian cells. The RCE strategy comprises a programmable guide RNA4, an engineered decoder tRNA, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. We first developed the RCE(ΨGA) system, which incorporates functional ncAAs into proteins via the ΨGA codon, demonstrating a higher translatome-wide and proteomic specificity compared with the genetic code expansion system. We further expanded our strategy to produce the RCE(ΨAA) and RCE(ΨAG) systems, with all three Ψ codon:(Ψ codon)-tRNAPyl pairs exhibiting mutual orthogonality. Moreover, we demonstrated that the RCE system cooperates compatibly with the genetic code expansion strategy for dual ncAA encoding. In sum, the RCE method utilized Ψ as a post-transcriptional ‘letter’ to encode and decode RNA codons in specific mRNA transcripts, opening a new route for genetic alphabet expansion and site-specific ncAA incorporation in eukaryotic cells.

 The Tweety homologues (TTYHs) constitute a family of eukaryotic membrane proteins that, on the basis of structural features, were recently proposed to contribute to lipid transfer between soluble carriers and cellular membranes1. However, in the absence of supporting data, this function was hypothetical. Here through pull-down of endogenous proteins, we identify APOE as the interaction partner of human TTYH2. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry assays showed that both proteins colocalize in endosomal compartments. Characterization of the specific interaction between APOE and TTYH2 through binding assays and structural studies enabled us to identify an epitope in an extended domain of TTYH2 that faces the endosomal lumen. Structures of complexes with APOE-containing lipoprotein particles revealed a binding mode that places lipids in a suitable position to facilitate their diffusion into the membrane. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed that lipid transfer is accelerated by TTYH2. Collectively, our findings indicate that TTYH2 has a role in the unloading of APOE-containing lipoproteins after they are endocytosed. These results define a new protein class that facilitates the extraction of lipids from and their insertion into cellular membranes. Although ubiquitous, this process could be of particular relevance in the brain, where APOE is involved in the transfer of lipids between astrocytes and neurons.

 Mitotic onset is a critical transition for eukaryotic cell proliferation. The commonly held view of mitotic control is that the master regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), is first activated in the cytoplasm, at the centrosome, initiating mitosis1–3. Bistability in CDK activation ensures that the transition is irreversible, but how this unfolds in a spatially compartmentalized cell is unknown4–8. Here, using fission yeast, we show that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, and that the bistable responses differ markedly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a stronger response in the nucleus driving mitotic signal propagation from there to the cytoplasm. Abolishing cyclin–CDK localization to the centrosome led to activation occurring only in the nucleus, spatially uncoupling the nucleus and cytoplasm mitotically, suggesting that centrosomal cyclin–CDK acts as a ‘signal relayer’. We propose that the key mitotic regulatory system operates in the nucleus in proximity to DNA, which enables incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage to be effectively monitored to preserve genome integrity and to integrate ploidy within the CDK control network. This spatiotemporal regulatory framework establishes core principles for control of the onset of mitosis and highlights that the CDK control system operates within distinct regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Experiments in fission yeast show that cyclin-dependent kinase is first activated in the nucleus, from which the mitotic signal is propagated from CDK at the centrosome to the cytoplasm."

 Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics1–4. Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware5–8, but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modelled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities and may change their material properties with use9–12. Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot’s actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots’ materials, actuation or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation. An approach that learns models of robots from video capture can predict the 3D motion outcomes of motor commands, enabling accurate control of a range of soft, biologically inspired robots from a single video camera."

 Gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders represent a major medical challenge, with few effective therapies available. These disorders often result from dysfunction of inhibitory nitric oxide (NO)-producing motor neurons in the enteric nervous system, which are essential for regulating gut motility. Loss or dysfunction of NO neurons is linked to severe conditions, including achalasia, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction and chronic constipation1,2. Here we introduce a platform based on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for therapeutic development targeting GI motility disorders. Using an unbiased screen, we identified drug candidates that modulate NO neuron activity and enhance motility in mouse colonic tissue ex vivo. We established a high-throughput strategy to define developmental programs driving the specification of NO neurons and found that inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) promotes their differentiation from precursors of the enteric nervous system. Transplantation of these neurons into NO-neuron-deficient mice led to robust engraftment and improved GI motility, offering a promising cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative GI disorders. These studies provide a new framework for understanding and treating enteric neuropathies.

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain malignancy1. Immunosuppression in the GBM tumour microenvironment (TME) is an important barrier to immune-targeted therapies, but our understanding of the mechanisms of immune regulation in the GBM TME is limited2. Here we describe a viral barcode interaction-tracing approach3 to analyse TME cell–cell communication in GBM clinical samples and preclinical models at single-cell resolution. We combine it with single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing analyses, human organotypic GBM cultures, in vivo cell-specific CRISPR–Cas9-driven genetic perturbations as well as human and mouse experimental systems to identify an annexin A1–formyl peptide receptor 1 (ANXA1–FPR1) bidirectional astrocyte–GBM communication pathway that limits tumour-specific immunity. FPR1 inhibits immunogenic necroptosis in tumour cells, and ANXA1 suppresses NF-κB and inflammasome activation in astrocytes. ANXA1 expression in astrocytes and FPR1 expression in cancer cells are associated with poor outcomes in individuals with GBM. The inactivation of astrocyte–glioma ANXA1–FPR1 signalling enhanced dendritic cell, T cell and macrophage responses, increasing infiltration by tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and limiting T cell exhaustion. In summary, we have developed a method to analyse TME cell–cell interactions at single-cell resolution in clinical samples and preclinical models, and used it to identify bidirectional astrocyte–GBM communication through ANXA1–FPR1 as a driver of immune evasion and tumour progression.  Using viral barcode tracing to detect interactions between glioblastoma cells and non-malignant astrocytes in patient samples, investigators discovered a pathway that reduces tumour-specific immunity and identified potential therapeutic targets."

 The brain represents sensory variables in the coordinated activity of neural populations, in which tuning curves of single neurons define the geometry of the population code1,2. Whether the same coding principle holds for dynamic cognitive variables remains unknown because internal cognitive processes unfold with a unique time course on single trials observed only in the irregular spiking of heterogeneous neural populations3–8. Here we show the existence of such a population code for the dynamics of choice formation in the primate premotor cortex. We developed an approach to simultaneously infer population dynamics and tuning functions of single neurons to the population state. Applied to spike data recorded during decision-making, our model revealed that populations of neurons encoded the same dynamic variable predicting choices, and heterogeneous firing rates resulted from the diverse tuning of single neurons to this decision variable. The inferred dynamics indicated an attractor mechanism for decision computation. Our results reveal a unifying geometric principle for neural encoding of sensory and dynamic cognitive variables.

 The global crisis of plastic waste accumulation threatens wildlife and ecosystems1. Catalytic processes that convert plastic waste into valuable chemicals and fuels offer promising solutions2. Recycling or upcycling of real-life plastic mixtures is challenging owing to their diverse composition and structure3. Here we propose a product-oriented strategy leveraging the orthogonality in reactivities of different functional groups in plastic mixtures to yield valuable products. This approach involves identifying functional groups followed by converting a selective component in the mixture to valuable products. We use mixtures of polystyrene, polylactic acid, polyurethane, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as real-life plastics, to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The diverse physical and chemical properties of these components, which typically hinder direct recovery, offer opportunities for extraction and transformation with the proposed strategy. From a 20-g mixture of real-life plastics, including polystyrene foam, a polylactic acid straw, a polyurethane tube, a polycarbonate mask, a polyvinyl chloride bag, a polyethylene terephthalate bottle, a polyethylene dropper and a polypropylene bottle, we obtained more than 8 separate chemicals: 1.3 g of benzoic acid, 0.5 g of plasticizer, 0.7 g of alanine, 0.7 g of lactic acid, 1.4 g of aromatic amine salt, 2.1 g of bisphenol A, 2.0 g of terephthalic acid and 3.5 g of C3–C6 alkanes.

 Postmitotic neurons have high levels of methylated cytosine and its oxidized intermediates such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine1. However, the functional relevance of these epigenetic modifications of DNA are poorly understood. Here we show that some cytidine analogues, such as cytarabine, cause DNA double-strand breaks during TET-mediated active 5-methylcytosine demethylation by interrupting TDG-dependent base excision repair. These double-strand breaks are frequently converted into deletions and translocations by DNA ligase 4. In vivo, Purkinje and Golgi cells in the cerebellum are the only neuronal populations that exhibit high levels of DNA damage due to cytarabine. In Purkinje cells, TET targets highly expressed gene bodies marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. Many of these genes control movement coordination, which explains the long-recognized cerebellar neurotoxicity of cytarabine2. We show that other cytidine analogues, such as gemcitabine, cause only single-strand breaks in neurons, which are repaired by DNA ligase 3 with minimal toxicity. Our findings uncover a mechanistic link between TET-mediated DNA demethylation, base excision repair and gene expression in neurons. The results also provide a rational explanation for the different neurotoxicity profiles of an important class of antineoplastic agents. Certain antimetabolites used to treat cancer are more neurotoxic than others, and it is now shown that this is due to their greater tendency to generate DNA double-stranded breaks, whereas less neurotoxic agents induce single-stranded breaks."

 Tailoring magnetic ordering in solid-state materials is essential for emerging spintronics1,2. However, substitutional lattice doping in magnetic semiconductors is often constrained by the low solubility of magnetic elements3–5, limiting the maximum achievable doping concentration (for example, less than 5%) and ferromagnetic ordering temperature6. The intercalation of magnetic elements in layered two-dimensional atomic crystals (2DACs) without breaking in-plane covalent bonds offers an alternative approach to incorporate a much higher concentration of magnetic atoms (for example, up to 50%) beyond the typical solubility limit. However, commonly used chemical and electrochemical intercalation methods are largely confined to a few isolated examples so far. Here we report a general two-step intercalation and cation-exchange strategy to produce a library of highly ordered magnetic intercalation superlattices (MISLs) with tunable magnetic ordering. Monovalent transition-metal cations Cu+ and Ag+, divalent magnetic cations Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+, and trivalent rare-earth cations Eu3+ and Gd3+ have been successfully incorporated into group-VIB 2DACs, including MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2, and group-IVB, -VB, -IIIA, -IVA and -VA 2DACs, including TiS2, NbS2, NbSe2, TaS2, In2Se3, SnSe2, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. We show that these MISLs can be prepared with tunable concentrations of magnetic intercalants, enabling tailored magnetic ordering across a diverse array of functional 2DACs, including semiconductors, topological insulators, and superconductors. This work establishes a versatile material platform for both fundamental investigations and spintronics applications.

 Lanthanides have shown magnetic memory at both the atomic1,2 and molecular3,4 level. The magnetic remanence temperatures of lanthanide single-molecule magnets can surpass d-transition metal examples5,6, and since 2017, energy barriers to magnetic reversal (Ueff) from 1,237(28) cm–1 to 1,631(25) cm–1 and open magnetic hysteresis loops between 40 K and 80 K have typically been achieved with axial dysprosium(III) bis(cyclopentadienyl) complexes7–17. It has been predicted that linear dysprosium(III) compounds could deliver greater mJ (the projection of the total angular momentum, J, on a quantization axis labelled z) state splitting and therefore higher Ueff and hysteresis temperatures18–21, but as lanthanide bonding is predominantly ionic22,23, so far dysprosium bis(amide) complexes have shown highly bent geometries that promote fast magnetic reversal24,25. Here we report a dysprosium bis(amide)–alkene complex, [Dy{N(SiiPr3)[Si(iPr)2C(CH3)=CHCH3]}{N(SiiPr3)(SiiPr2Et)}][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] (1-Dy), that shows Ueff = 1,843(11) cm–1 and slow closing of soft magnetic hysteresis loops up to 100 K. Calculations show that the Ueff value for 1-Dy arises from the charge-dense amide ligands, with a pendant alkene taking a structural role to enforce a large N–Dy–N angle while imposing only a weak equatorial interaction. This leads to molecular spin dynamics up to 100 times slower than the current best single-molecule magnets above 90 K.

 An increasing number of scholars, policymakers and grassroots communities argue that artificial intelligence (AI) research—and computer-vision research in particular—has become the primary source for developing and powering mass surveillance1–7. Yet, the pathways from computer vision to surveillance continue to be contentious. Here we present an empirical account of the nature and extent of the surveillance AI pipeline, showing extensive evidence of the close relationship between the field of computer vision and surveillance. Through an analysis of computer-vision research papers and citing patents, we found that most of these documents enable the targeting of human bodies and body parts. Comparing the 1990s to the 2010s, we observed a fivefold increase in the number of these computer-vision papers linked to downstream surveillance-enabling patents. Additionally, our findings challenge the notion that only a few rogue entities enable surveillance. Rather, we found that the normalization of targeting humans permeates the field. This normalization is especially striking given patterns of obfuscation. We reveal obfuscating language that allows documents to avoid direct mention of targeting humans, for example, by normalizing the referring to of humans as ‘objects’ to be studied without special consideration.

 Materials emitting circularly polarized light (CPL) are highly sought after for applications ranging from efficient displays to quantum information technologies1–7. However, established methods for time-resolved CPL (TRCPL) characterization have notable limitations8–17, generally requiring a compromise between sensitivity, accessible timescales and spectral information. This has limited the acquisition of in-depth photophysical insight necessary for materials development. Here we demonstrate a high-sensitivity (noise level of the order of 10−4), broadband (about 400–900 nm), transient (nanosecond resolution, millisecond range) full-Stokes (CPL and linear polarizations) spectroscopy setup. The achieved combination of high-sensitivity, broad wavelength response and flexible time ranges represents a substantial advancement over previous TRCPL approaches. As a result, TRCPL measurements are shown to be applicable to hitherto inaccessible material systems and photophysical processes, including systems with low (10−3) dissymmetry factors and luminescence pathways spanning nanosecond to millisecond time ranges. Finally, full-Stokes measurements allow tracking the temporal evolution of linear polarization components, of interest by themselves, but especially relevant in the context of controlling for associated CPL artefacts18,19 in the time domain.

But is all lithium metal equal? Here, the authors analyze the influence of lithium purity and show how different lithium metal samples can be, especially when electrodeposited in “anode-free” cells. 
 Recent studies emphasize that incorporating lithium metal electrodes can increase the energy density of next generation batteries. However, the production of lithium metal with high purity requires multi-stage purification steps due to its high reactivity. Furthermore, subsequent handling under inert conditions is required to prevent degradation. To circumvent handling of lithium metal and further improve energy density, researchers are exploring reservoir-free cells often referred to as “anode-free” cells. Reservoir-free cells are assembled without using lithium metal. Instead, lithium is electrodeposited at the interface between a current collector and a solid electrolyte from positive electrode materials during the first charge. Despite the potential of reservoir-free cells, there is limited understanding of the purity of electrodeposited lithium metal and how impurities might affect the electrochemical kinetics. This study examines first the purity of electrodeposited lithium at the steel|Li6PS5Cl interface. Then, it shows how impurities in lithium electrodes affect stripping capacity when using commercial lithium metal foils with both Li6PS5Cl and Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 as solid electrolytes. By using time-of-flight secondary mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, we reveal that a lithium layer with high purity is electrodeposited at the negative electrode in reservoir-free cells and that common impurities in lithium metal (reservoir-type) electrodes like e.g. sodium negatively influence the accessible lithium capacity during discharge.

 Embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) is a lethal embryonal brain tumor entity. To investigate the intratumoral heterogeneity and cellular communication in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we analyze in this work single-cell RNA sequencing of about 250,000 cells of primary human and murine ETMR, in vitro cultures, and a 3D forebrain organoid model of ETMR, supporting the main findings with immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomics of human tumors. We characterize three distinct malignant ETMR subpopulations - RG-like, NProg-like and NB-like - positioned within a putative neurodevelopmental hierarchy. We reveal PDGFRβ+ pericytes as key communication partners in the TME, contributing to stem cell signaling through extracellular matrix-mediated interactions with tumor cells. PDGF signaling is upregulated in chemoresistant RG-like cells in vivo and plays a role in recruiting pericytes to ETMR TME by finalizing a signaling cascade which promotes the differentiation of non-malignant radial glia cells, derived from our 3D model, into pericyte-like cells. Selective PDGFR-inhibition blocked the lineage differentiation into pericytes in vitro and reduced the tumor cell population in vivo. Targeting ETMR-pericyte interactions in the TME presents a promising therapeutic approach. Embryonal tumour with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) is a rare and aggressive paediatric brain tumour.

 Deep tissue imaging with high contrast close to or even below the optical resolution limit is still challenging due to optical aberrations and scattering introduced by dense biological samples. This results in high complexity and cost of microscopes that can facilitate such challenges. Here, we demonstrate a cost-effective and simple to implement method to turn most two-photon laser-scanning microscopes into a super-resolution microscope for deep tissue imaging. We realize this by adding inexpensive optical devices, namely a cylindrical lens, a field rotator, and a sCMOS camera to these systems. By combining two-photon excitation with patterned line-scanning and subsequent image reconstruction, we achieve imaging of sub-cellular structures in Pinus radiata, mouse heart muscle and zebrafish. In addition, the penetration depth of super-resolved imaging in highly scattering tissue is considerably extended by using the camera’s lightsheet shutter mode. The flexibility of our method allows the examination of a variety of thick samples with a variety of fluorescent markers and microscope objective lenses. Thus, with a cost-efficient modification of a multi-photon microscope, an up to twofold resolution enhancement is demonstrated down to at least 70μm deep in tissue.

Here, the authors show that a post-translational modification on microtubules encodes activity-dependent signals instructing neuronal remodeling in the central and peripheral nervous system. 
 Developmental remodeling shapes neural circuits via activity-dependent pruning of synapses and axons. Regulation of the cytoskeleton is critical for this process, as microtubule loss via enzymatic severing is an early step of pruning across many circuits and species. However, how microtubule-severing enzymes, such as spastin, are activated in specific neuronal compartments remains unknown. Here, we reveal that polyglutamylation, a post-translational tubulin modification enriched in neurons, plays an instructive role in developmental remodeling by tagging microtubules for severing. Motor neuron-specific gene deletion of enzymes that add or remove tubulin polyglutamylation—TTLL glutamylases vs. CCP deglutamylases—accelerates or delays neuromuscular synapse remodeling in a neurotransmission-dependent manner. This mechanism is not specific to peripheral synapses but also operates in central circuits, e.g., the hippocampus. Thus, tubulin polyglutamylation acts as a cytoskeletal rheostat of remodeling that shapes neuronal morphology and connectivity. Cytoskeletal breakdown is a hallmark of synapse elimination. Here, the authors show that a post-translational modification on microtubules encodes activity-dependent signals instructing neuronal remodeling in the central and peripheral nervous system."

 Macrocyclic peptides represent an attractive drug modality due to their favourable properties and amenability to in vitro evolution techniques such as phage or mRNA display. Although very powerful, these technologies are not without limitations. In this work, we address some of their drawbacks by developing a yeast display-based strategy to generate, screen and characterise structurally diverse disulfide-cyclised peptides. The use of quantitative flow cytometry enables real-time monitoring of the screening of millions of individual macrocyclic peptides, leading to the identification of ligands with good binding properties to five different protein targets.

This study models adaptive transitions in collective travel behaviour during flood events across different cities to quantify recovery and adaptive learning from failures and reveal adaptation drivers. 
 As extreme weather events enhanced by climate change pose challenges to the resilience of critical infrastructure, the ability to handle disruptions, avoid tipping points, adapt and transform in crises becomes essential. Despite advances in resilience research, there is a need to improve empirical evidence and mathematical models to quantify the systems’ adaptive capabilities to extreme climate-related phenomena, such as floods. This research fills this gap by integrating an agent-based multimodal traffic functional model with a compound failure model to provide valuable insights into adaptation patterns (that is, mode shift and route switching) and risk mitigation in response to flood-related disruptions. The proposed modelling approach not only quantifies the recovery and adaptive capacity against failures, going beyond traditional resilience analyses, but also unveils the key factors that drive adaptation of transportation to flood-induced disasters. These factors include variations in trip demand and network density, which together reveal a universal law of mode shift. The study provides valuable insights into the design of resilient and sustainable critical infrastructure systems, such as transportation, energy and communication systems capable of withstanding severe flood events while maintaining their functionality. Extreme weather events will require resilient and adaptive critical infrastructure.

 Orbital imaging spectroscopy in the shortwave infrared is a powerful measurement technique that can lead to the detection and monitoring of both anthropogenic and natural methane point sources. Analysts map the absorption of methane by applying spectroscopic detection methods like the matched filter (MF) or Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) at each pixel in a scene. Unfortunately, methane plume identification is complicated by false detections due to instrument noise, especially for subtle methane enhancements at low signal levels, and surface spectroscopy features that mimic gas methane absorption features. Current systems rely on manual review to vet these detections. This review process is time consuming and can be subjective for plumes close to the instrument detection limit. As observations scale up from proof of concept studies with hundreds of plumes to global monitoring systems having thousands, improved automation will be necessary to reduce the cost and subjectivity of manual review. This paper presents a new purely spectroscopic approach for rejecting false positives based on the aggregate plume transmittance. Specifically, we use the total plume transmittance as a discriminator with improved model properties and noise statistics that can dramatically improve false positive rejection rates. A sampling approach provides rigorous detection p-values that account for spatial correlations in background interference. We demonstrate the approach on a catalog of thousands of plumes from the EMIT (Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation) imaging spectrometer, and illustrate its use in the context of a methane plume mapping workflow. This process identifies 92 potential errors in the existing review process: 42 likely false positives and 50 false negatives. Including spectral information during the plume review process can disambiguate marginal detections, making methane point source observing campaigns more robust and sensitive than a review process based primarily on plume morphology."

 Shallow earthquakes are among the most devastating natural hazards, and aerosol anomalies offer insights into crust–atmosphere interactions critical for earthquake forecasting and environmental assessment. However, standardized anomaly extraction protocols—especially whether to center analyses on epicenters or fault zones—remain undefined, and the driving mechanisms of these anomalies are insufficiently studied. This work utilizes MODIS AOD retrievals and a background field–based Robust Satellite Technique (RST) algorithm to detect AOD anomalies linked to 14 global shallow-focus earthquakes using a 2σ threshold, followed by statistical significance testing (p < 0.05). Spatiotemporal analysis of five representative events reveals that higher-magnitude earthquakes generate stronger (up to 6.28σ) and longer-lasting (≥4 days) AOD perturbations.

Marine anomalies cluster around fault zones; coastal anomalies appear as discrete points near faults; inland anomalies show pre-seismic, banded distributions migrating toward epicenters. By employing buffer zones of 0.5°, 1°, and 2°, we isolated pre- and post-seismic AOD anomalies across diverse tectonic settings. The results suggest that a 1° buffer is the optimal spatial window for most earthquake cases. Micro–scale diagnostics via aerosol classification maps and particle–size distribution metrics identified shifts between fine– and coarse–mode particles, while macro–scale HYSPLIT–4 backward–trajectory analyses elucidated the roles of local topography, anthropogenic emissions, and dust storm inputs on anomaly formation. These findings advance our understanding of seismic aerosol perturbations and inform the development of integrated remote–sensing frameworks for earthquake monitoring and environmental impact assessment."

 This study proposes an application framework for automatically interpreting regional characteristics of heritage houses with the support of 3D digital landscape (3D-DLS) and point cloud deep learning (PC-DL) models, taking the northeastern region of Aba prefecture as an example. The significant contribution of this framework is introducing (1) the self-developed MSBFI model to decode the quantitative discriminative logic of the PC-DL model in categorizing the regional characteristics of heritage house point clouds, and (2) how it combines the generated saliency point clouds and the semantic segmentation point clouds to automatically filter the feature elements of each sub-region and analyze the regional characteristics of heritage houses. The proposed framework can adaptively calibrate multi-scale sensitivity weights, demonstrating strong compatibility with built heritage studies through its focused analysis of composite building scales, while maintaining superior computational efficiency. The conclusions of this framework on heritage houses are more quantitative, objective, and validated by the relevant field survey studies. In addition, this study fills the gap in interpreting the regional characteristics of Tibetan houses on a whole-area scale in the northeastern region of Aba prefecture."

 Surface water resources are crucial for agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods, particularly in water-scarce regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. In Lesotho, understanding the dynamics of seasonal and perennial water bodies is vital for informed water resource management and policy development. This study evaluates spectral indices for mapping and analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water across different agroecological zones (AEZs) in Lesotho from 2016 to 2024 water years. Using harmonized Sentinel imagery integrated into a Random Forest machine-learning framework, we applied a range of water, vegetation, and soil indices to map surface water monthly and distinguish between seasonal and perennial water surfaces. Our findings reveal that the water ratio index was the most effective for mapping surface water across AEZs, outperforming others in distinguishing water from rangeland, cropland, and bare soil. Additional indices further improved water delineation in specific AEZs. Although no significant differences in classification accuracy were observed across AEZs (p > 0.05), visual inspection revealed misclassifications, mainly false positives, which could lead to overestimates of water area. Surface water trends vary regionally, with a significant increase in perennial water in the Foothills and Mountains, while seasonal water shows a non-significant decline, indicating divergent hydrological trajectories. These findings underscore the need for region-specific assessments and management strategies to address the evolving hydrological regimes. Our study provides a scalable framework for water resource assessment applicable beyond Lesotho, with significant implications for addressing water scarcity and guiding policies on water storage, climate-smart agriculture, and community-based governance in Sub-Saharan Africa."

 Nitrate and organic components have been considered key contributors to high PM2.5 concentrations in Korea. This study examines the chemical evolution of aerosol species influenced by atmospheric ammonia (NH3) in Hongseong county, Chungcheongnam-do, Republic of Korea, during late spring 2024 (May 20 – June 18), a period characterized by intensive agricultural activity. Using an aerosol chemical speciation monitor and ammonia analyzer, an ammonium-rich atmospheric state (average NH3 concentration: 26.7 ± 12.4 ppb) was observed, with notable contributions from ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3−), and sulfate (SO42−), especially under high-humidity conditions. The relative contributions of nitrate to PM2.5 for low (0–15 μg/m3), medium (16–30 μg/m3), and high (over 30 μg/m3) concentration intervals were 13.8 %, 23.4 %, and 29.6 %, respectively. Elevated relative humidity (RH), averaging 63.1 % (low), 82.3 % (medium), and 91.7 % (high), played a significant role in nitrate formation for those concentration intervals. Elevated nighttime ammonium conversion ratios (NHR) highlighted the importance of abundant atmospheric NH3 under high RH conditions, facilitating effective heterogeneous uptake and subsequent particulate ammonium formation. Source tracking using the conditional bivariate probability function (CBPF) model identified agricultural fields, power plants, and industrial complexes as major sources of precursor emissions. These results emphasize the need to control emissions of NH3, SO2, and NOx in rural areas to mitigate PM2.5 pollution and improve air quality."

 Knowledge about the dynamics of changes in PM10 lead concentration and the dependence of its levels on weather patterns is significant for health protection, especially in large cities. Also, it is important because of the need for effective environmental management. This study used the results of daily measurements conducted by the Polish State Environmental Monitoring and Weather Monitoring systems in 2010–2022. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique was most commonly used for the determination of PM10 Pb. Significant seasonal variability was observed (> 2 times higher values were determined in the heating period than in the non-heating period), while a downward trend in PM10 Pb concentration was demonstrated at the majority of the monitoring stations, which are mainly located in the southern part of Poland. In the heating period, the Pb concentration decreased on average by >4 times, while in the non-heating period it decreased by >2 times. The Pb concentration results are predominantly within two ranges: < 0.01 μg·m⁻3 and 0.01–0.1 μg·m⁻3. In the heating period, 32 % of results were in the <0.01 μg·m⁻3 range, and 66 % of results were in the 0.01–0.1 μg·m⁻3 range. In the non-heating period, it was the opposite: 65 % of results were in the <0.01 μg·m⁻3 range, and 34 % results were in the 0.01–0.1 μg·m⁻3 range. The annual norm, amounting to ≤0.5 μg·m⁻3 Pb in PM10, was not exceeded at any of the examined stations during the study years. A significant negative impact of meteorological parameters on Pb concentrations in PM10 was found in all the analyzed periods. Above average concentrations of Pb were accompanied by below average air temperatures and precipitation. The results of the study can help to develop pollution control policies and sector-specific health protection strategies so as to mitigate negative health effects related to exposure to particulate pollutants."

We combined simulations based on three ocean models with data from an actual experimental voyage conducted in 2019. The results showed that travel across this sea would have been possible on both the modern and Late Pleistocene oceans if a dugout canoe was used with a suitable departure place and paddling strategy. Recognizing the Kuroshio, paddling to counteract this current, and using high-level navigation were crucial to success.

However, it is unclear how the biophysical adaptation of intracellular organelles responds to mechanical stress or how these adaptive changes affect cellular homeostasis. Here, using the tendon cell as a mechanosensitive cell type within a bioreactor, we show that the tension of the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adaptively increases in response to repetitive external stimuli. Depletion of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the highest expressed PM-ER tether protein, interfered with mechanotransduction from the PM to the ER, and affected the ER tension. We found that an optimized mechanical strain increased ER tension in a homeostatic manner, but excessive strain resulted in ER expansion, as well as activating ER stress. Last, we showed that changes in ER tension were linked with ER-mitochondria interactions and associated with cellular energetics and function. Together, these findings identify a PM-ER mechanotransduction mechanism that dose-dependently regulates cellular metabolism."

Two giant impacts reshaped the southern hemisphere, where an older basin is partially superposed by the younger Rheasilvia basin. The origin of the Divalia Fossae is widely accepted as directly linked to the Rheasilvia impact, either by tectonics caused immediately by the impact, up-spinning, or secondary cratering. We present several geologic constraints that support a tectonic origin of the troughs due to the adjustment of Vesta’s spin axis to a geoid changed by both large impacts. The best fit to Vesta’s gravitational field corresponds to a spin axis reorientation of 3° that, when coupled with despinning, induces a stress state that predicts Divalia Fossae’s established location, fracture type, and orientation. These insights underline the importance of tectonic processes in the early evolution of protoplanets."

Using an integrated approach combining phylogenomic and ecomorphological data for 1051 ray-finned fishes, a time-dependent evolutionary model, and comparative genomic analyses of 205 marine vertebrates, we show that ecological interactions with modern cetaceans coincided with the evolution of endothermy in ray-finned fishes during the Eocene-Miocene. This result is supported by evidence of temporal and geographical overlap between cetaceans and endothermic fish lineages in the fossil record, as well as correlations between cetacean diversification and the origin of endothermy in fishes. Phylogenetic comparative analyses identified correlations between endothermy, large body sizes, and specialized swimming modes while challenging diet specialization and depth range expansion hypotheses. Comparative genomic analyses identified several genes under selection in endothermic lineages, includingcarnmt1(involved in fatty acid metabolism) anddcaf6(associated with development).

Using Higgs echo spectroscopy, we also uncover unconventional echo formation caused by inhomogeneous broadening and “soft” QP bands, which dynamically evolve under terahertz (THz) driving. Specifically, THz pulse pairs modulate the superconducting gap, imprinting coherence and forming a temporal “Higgs grating.” This grating produces echoes with distinctive characteristics: (i) echo rephasing spectral peaks at superconducting gap frequencies, (ii) asymmetric echo formation delays unlike those observed in atoms or semiconductors, and (iii) negative-time echo signals stemming from Higgs-QP anharmonic interactions.

Further analysis reveals that inhibition from SOM to parvalbumin interneurons must be limited to allow gradual transitions from asynchrony to synchrony and that the strength of recurrent excitation onto SOM neurons determines the level of synchrony achievable in the network. Our results are consistent with recent experimental findings on cell type–specific manipulations.

Microbial methane often deviates from isotope and isotopolog equilibrium in surface environments but approaches equilibrium in deep subsurface sediments. The origin of this near-equilibrium isotopic signature in methane, whether directly produced by methanogens or achieved through anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), remains uncertain. Here, we show that, in the absence of AOM, microbial methane produced from deep-sea sediments exhibits isotopolog compositions approaching thermodynamic equilibrium due to energy limitation. In contrast, microbial methane from salt marsh and thermokarst lakes exhibits significant hydrogen and clumped isotopic disequilibrium due to high free-energy availability. We propose that clumped isotopologs of methane provide a proxy for characterizing the bioenergetics of environments for methane production. Together, these observations demonstrate methane clumped isotopes as a powerful tool to better understand the relation between methane metabolisms and the energy landscape in natural environments."

This adaptive strategy resulted in successful task performance, as evidenced by anticipatory looking toward correct target locations. The ability to estimate volatility varied significantly across infants, and these individual differences were related to infant temperament, indicating early links between cognitive adaptation and emotional responsivity.

In this work, we have demonstrated that Zn2+features the strongest anti-inflammatory performance by screening 10 representative metal ions, and the MTC1 agonists can trigger lysosomal Zn2+release and inhibit pyroptosis in macrophages. Based on these findings, we further engineered a mucolipin TRP channel 1 (MTC1)–related therapeutic nanoplatform for endogenously triggering lysosomal zinc release to curb inflammation and block macrophage pyroptosis. This nanoplatform consists of mesoporous silica nanoparticles to deliver MTC1 agonists and carbon nanodots, which could synergistically exert antiatherosclerotic effect by scavenging toxic reactive oxygen species, inhibiting macrophage pyroptosis, modulating macrophage transition, and rebuilding atherosclerotic immune microenvironment. These findings demonstrate that macrophage pyroptosis can be efficiently blocked via leveraging self-lysosomal zinc pool, which provides the paradigm of lysosomal zinc modulation-involved nanotherapeutics for managing other inflammatory diseases."

Inspired by cryptobiosis in nature, researchers have pioneered approaches to create cell-in-shell nanobiohybrids, aiming to endow cells with enhanced protection and exogenous functions.

Our system harnesses ethanol fermentation bySaccharomyces cerevisiae, chemically coupled with an enzymatic cascade involving alcohol oxidase and horseradish peroxidase, to drive the nanoshell formation of polydopamine. The integration of autonomous shell formation with cellular proliferation produces anisotropic cell-in-shell structures, which can serve as enzyme-powered cell microrobots, upon conjugation with urease.

Here, we observed that the deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1 was moderately elevated in human hypertrophic myocardium and mouse models. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of YOD1 reduced Ang II– and TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Subsequently, we used multiple proteomic analyses to identify and confirm STAT3 as a substrate protein for YOD1. Mechanistically, our findings revealed that the C155 site of YOD1 removes K48-linked ubiquitin chains from K97 on STAT3, stabilizing STAT3 levels and enhancing its nuclear translocation in cardiomyocytes under Ang II stimulation. Notably, inhibiting STAT3 reversed the antihypertrophic effects of YOD1 deficiency in Ang II–challenged mice. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of YOD1 mitigated Ang II–induced pathological ventricular remodeling in mice.

Reducing hERG binding to obviate potential cardiac toxicity is crucial. Nanotechnology has been applied to drug delivery for reducing drug toxicity and improving efficacy, but few studies have addressed hERG-related cardiotoxicity. We report the use of self-assembling dendrimer nanosystems for drug formulation and delivery, which effectively reduced hERG binding and associated toxicity while promoting therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, these dendrimer nanosystems efficiently encapsulated the antimalarial drug chloroquine, the anticancer agent doxorubicin, and the NUPR1 inhibitor ZZW115, all three having high affinity to hERG channels. These nanoformulations showed three- to eightfold reduced hERG binding affinity, which, in animal models, translated to abolished toxicity.

Here, we show that the sequential functions of the decidual reaction—implantation and decidualization—pivot on the time-sensitive loss of progesterone-resistantDIO2+stromal cells that form a specialized implantation niche and reciprocal expansion of progesterone-dependentPLA2G2A+predecidual cells. Simultaneously, uterine natural killer (uNK) cell proliferation results in the accumulation of immunotolerant subsets. Examination of endometrial biopsies from 924 women revealed that the recurrence risk of miscarriage closely aligns with the incidence of a weakened or stalled decidual reaction, more so than poor uNK cell expansion. Analysis of paired biopsies obtained in different cycles and modeling in assembloids intimated that prior miscarriages disrupt intercycle endometrial homeostasis and calibration of the decidual reaction.

Based on intratumoral CD4+cell distribution patterns within the core and periphery, we distinguished responders to combined αPD-1/4-1BB antibodies early on-treatment. CD4-PET identified resistance to αPD-1 monotherapy, which was mitigated by adding regulatory T cell–depleting α4-1BB antibodies. Patients with early-stage non–small cell lung cancer who relapsed after neoadjuvant αPD-L1 therapy revealed low CD4+T cell densities in the tumor core.

Here, we conducted a unidirectional crowd movement experiment, in which we tracked the movement of pedestrian crowds through foot tracking. We find experimentally that pedestrian crowds can exhibit three distinct dynamical regimes (free regime, slow-moving regime, and jammed regime) depending on the crowd density. In the free regime, pedestrians’ movement is not constrained; in the slow-moving regime, pedestrians’ speed is constrained, but pedestrians’ movement direction in each step is not influenced; and in the jammed regime, both pedestrians’ speed and movement direction in each step are constrained.

A relative depletion of inorganic nitrogen and phosphate during the bloom was correlated with higher expression of genes involved in endocytosis, autophagy, and lysosomal activity.

A further synthesis on global continental rivers shows that sea level change affects large, low-gradient lowland fluvial systems farther upstream than generally recognized, with postperturbation geomorphologic equilibrium reachable in timescales comparable to the length of Quaternary glacial cycles."

Brownell;Andrew J. Read,"The future of baleen whales: Recoveries, environmental constraints, and climate change","Most baleen whales were severely overexploited during the past century, but many populations have received near-complete protection from exploitation for more than a half-century. Some of these populations have made remarkable recoveries and are now approaching pre-exploitation levels of abundance. Contrary to expectations of baleen whales making minor oscillations around equilibrium abundances, several populations that have made the strongest recoveries have experienced major mortality events. We review examples from the literature showing increasing demographic variability in recovering populations of baleen whales and present a simulation study on the expected response of recovered versus depleted whale population to environmental variability and climate impacts. We propose that baleen whales are more sensitive to environmental variability than previously recognized; that major demographic fluctuations will become the norm as baleen whales recover; and that climate-driven disruptions to whale population dynamics will be most dramatic in populations with the lowest rates of anthropogenic mortality."
