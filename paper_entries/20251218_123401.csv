Grimalt;Barend L. Van Drooge,"Origin, transport and processing of organic aerosols at different altitudes in coastal Mediterranean urban areas","Distance changes air pollution in a city, but so does the time of the day and the year, due to varying emission sources and weather conditions. These changes were studied at ground level and 400 meters above the city, and showed that wood burning affected the air quality in winter, while products of atmospheric reaction processes dominated the air in summer. Traffic emissions arrive to the elevated site during the day, while they were trapped at lower level in the night. 
 Organic molecular markers in atmospheric PM10 were analysed by off-line GC-MS techniques in an urban background site (81 m above sea level (a.s.l.)) and in a nearby elevated sub-urban background site (415 ma.s.l.), in cold and warm periods in Barcelona; situated in the Western Mediterranean Basin. Previous studies reported similar PM concentrations and substantial organic matter contributions in both sites but did not analyze the organic molecular composition, which is expected to vary within the city's vertical airshed due to a weakening influence of local emission sources and enhanced influence of regional air masses. Multi-variant analysis of organic molecular marker concentrations, together with major air quality parameters (NO, NO2, O3, PM10), resolved six components that represented primary emissions sources and secondary organic aerosol formation processes: (1) diurnal traffic, (2) nocturnal traffic, (3) biomass burning, (4) biogenic with primary and secondary organic markers, (5) fresh secondary, and (6) regional secondary. Urban traffic emissions reached the elevated site during daytime through the sea-mountain breeze, while nocturnal traffic emissions accumulated in the nighttime urban atmosphere, when the two sites were often disconnected by temperature inversions. Biomass burning, dominant in the cold period, was the main contributor to toxic PAHs in these two background sites. Regional secondary organic aerosol contribution was more abundant in the elevated background site. Several SOA formation mechanisms were identified such as the oxidation of traffic emissions by NOx, the aqueous-phase oxidation under high relative humidity, and formation of fresh SOA under conditions of low relative humidity."
10.5194/acp-25-18409-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文研究气溶胶特性与气象条件对深对流云微物理过程的影响，涉及气溶胶的粒径分布、硫酸盐组分、吸湿性等具体参数，并探讨了大气-云相互作用模型。虽然未直接提及卫星遥感技术，但气溶胶与云的相互作用是大气遥感监测（如卫星反演气溶胶、云参数）的重要基础研究，其结论可为改进遥感参数化方案提供依据。因此，论文与大气遥感技术存在间接相关性。,"['aerosol size distribution', 'Aitken-mode', 'hygroscopicity', 'bin-microphysics parcel model', 'cloud droplet spectra']",Huihui Wu;Nicholas Marsden;Paul Connolly;Michael Flynn;Paul I.

Thamban;Keith Bower;Alan Blyth;Martin Gallagher;Hugh Coe,The role of aerosols and meteorological conditions  in shaping cloud droplet development in New  Mexico summer deep-convective systems,"Airborne observations over the Magdalena Mountains in New Mexico underscore the combined influence of meteorological conditions and aerosol characteristics on the development of deep-convective clouds under different flow regimes. Model-observation comparisons emphasize the critical role of aerosol entrainment in reproducing the observed broad cloud droplet spectra. This study provides valuable constraints for improving parameterizations of aerosol-cloud interactions in deep convective systems. 
 The accurate representation of aerosol physicochemical properties is important when describing aerosol–cloud interactions. The Deep Convective Microphysics Experiment (DCMEX) aimed to improve the representation of microphysical processes in deep convective systems. As part of this project, an airborne campaign (July to August 2022) was conducted to characterize the thermodynamics–dynamic–aerosol–cloud system over the isolated Magdalena Mountains in New Mexico, US. Backward dispersion analyses identified a transition in dominant airmass origins from Northwest (NW) continental to Southeast (SE) aged oceanic flow, coinciding with substantial changes in meteorological conditions and aerosol characteristics. The SE-flow period generally exhibited lower lifting condensation levels, enhanced convection, higher boundary layer humidity, and more frequent and intense precipitation, compared to the NW-flow period. During the SE-flow period, aerosol size distributions showed a more pronounced bimodality, characterized by increased Aitken-mode concentrations and fewer but larger accumulation-mode particles, indicating enhanced cloud processing. Submicron aerosols exhibited larger sulfate fractions, more oxidized organics, and greater hygroscopicity. Correspondingly, clouds presented larger droplet sizes and liquid water contents. A bin-microphysics parcel model was also employed to simulate the development of cloud droplets, constrained by airborne observations. Model-observation comparisons highlight the critical role of aerosol entrainment in reproducing the observed broad cloud droplet spectra extending toward small sizes. The results underscore the combined influence of meteorological conditions and aerosol characteristics on cloud microphysics under different flow regimes and emphasize the importance of aerosol entrainment in the development of deep convective clouds. This study provides valuable constraints for improving parameterizations of aerosol–cloud interactions in convective systems."
10.5194/acp-25-18373-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文主要探讨基于现场观测的NOx和碳14（14CO2）测量，以及通过STILT模型和TNO排放清单估算化石燃料CO2（ffCO2）的方法。其核心技术是地面在 situ 测量和模型模拟，而非卫星观测、遥感传感器或大气成分分析等远程传感技术。虽然涉及大气环境污染物（如NOx、CO2）的研究，但未使用遥感手段（如卫星传感器、航空观测）进行数据获取或分析，因此与远程传感技术关联较弱。,"['radiocarbon measurements', 'NOx', 'STILT model', 'TNO', '14CO2']",Hannes Juchem;Fabian Maier;Ingeborg Levin;Armin Jordan;Denis Pöhler;Claudius Rosendahl;Julian Della Coletta;Susanne Preunkert;Samuel Hammer,Challenges and benefits of using NOx as a quantitative proxy for fossil fuel CO2 in an urban area based on radiocarbon measurements,"This study explores how in situ NOx observations can be used to estimate fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) enhancements in an urban context, based on radiocarbon measurements. Even with a simple approach to account for atmospheric chemistry and ratio variability, a strong correlation could be observed, allowing the construction of a high temporal resolution NOx-based ffCO2 record with uncertainties comparable to the use of CO as proxy. Comparisons with independent records show good agreement between them. 
 Radiocarbon (14CO2) observations are the benchmark for quantifying fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) in the atmosphere, but continuous 14CO2 measurements are not yet available. Continuous estimates of ffCO2 can be made by observing continuously measurable proxies that are co-emitted during fossil fuel combustion. This paper investigates the potential and challenges of using in situ NOx observations in urban areas to quantitatively estimate hourly ffCO2 enhancements, in the example of the ICOS pilot station in Heidelberg, Germany. The short atmospheric lifetime of NOx limits the use of the observed signal to a local area. Thus, a local NOx and ffCO2 background was approximated using the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model and bottom-up emission estimates from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). Using 14CO2 data from 185 hourly integrated flask samples between 2020–2021, mean ratios of local excess NOx (ΔNOx) to local excess ffCO2 (ΔffCO2) of 1.40 ppb ppm−1 for winter and 2.12 ppb ppm−1 for summer were calculated. These ratios were applied to the ΔNOx time series to construct continuous ΔffCO2 estimates. The uncertainty of the ΔNOx-based ΔffCO2 record was estimated at 3.94 ppm. Comparisons with 14CO2-based and ΔCO-based ΔffCO2 estimates showed good agreement, while still demonstrating distinct behaviour for individual events. ΔNOx shows considerable potential as ΔffCO2 proxy and as useful addition to ΔCO-based estimates, as both proxies have different footprints due to their lifetimes. A key challenge remains in reliably determining the seasonal and diurnal cycle of average ΔNOx to ΔffCO2 ratios."
10.5194/amt-18-7679-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该论文聚焦于利用多任务卫星测量协同提升气溶胶和地表特征反演，涉及卫星观测技术（如Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI、Sentinel-3A/B/OLCI）、数据融合算法（SYREMIS/GRASP）、气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）及地表特性分析，均属于大气环境遥感技术的核心领域。,"['SYREMIS', 'GRASP', 'Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)', 'Surface characterization', 'Polar-orbiting satellite synergy']",Pavel Litvinov;Cheng Chen;Oleg Dubovik;Siyao Zhai;Christian Matar;Chong Li;Anton Lopatin;David Fuertes;Tatyana Lapyonok;Lukas Bindreiter;Manuel Dornacher;Arthur Lehner;Alexandru Dandocsi;Daniele Gasbarra;Christian Retscher,Synergetic retrieval from multi-mission spaceborne measurements for enhanced aerosol and surface characterization,"Developed SYREMIS (SYnergetic REtrieval from Multi-MISsion instruments) approach is based on three main principles: (i) harmonization of the multi-instruments L1 measurements, (ii) their “weighting”, and (iii) optimization of the forward models and the retrieval setups. It substantially enhances aerosol and surface characterization from spaceborne measurements. The approach can be extended to future missions, including synergy with multi-angular, multi-spectral, and polarimetric measurements. 
 Atmospheric aerosol is one of the main drivers of climate change.  Currently, a number of different satellites in Earth orbit are dedicated to aerosol studies. Due to limited information content, the primary aerosol product of most satellite missions is AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth), while the accuracy of aerosol size and type retrieval from spaceborne remote sensing still requires improvement. Combining measurements from different satellites increases their information content and, therefore, can provide new possibilities for retrieving an extended set of both aerosol and surface properties.In this paper, we present the physical basis and concept of the recently developed synergetic approach for aerosol and surface characterization using diverse spaceborne measurements (hereinafter SYREMIS (SYnergetic REtrieval from Multi-MISsion instruments) approach). The approach was implemented in the GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties) algorithm and has been tested on two types of synergetic measurements: (i) synergy of polar-orbiting satellites (LEO + LEO synergy combining Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI, Sentinel-3A/OLCI, and Sentinel-3B/OLCI instruments), (ii) synergy of polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites (LEO + GEO synergy based on Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI, Sentinel-3A/OLCI, Sentinel-3B/OLCI, and Himawari-8/AHI instruments). On the one hand, such a synergetic satellite constellation extends the spectral range of the measurements. On the other hand, it provides unprecedented global spatial coverage with high temporal resolution, which is crucial for a number of climate studies. It is shown that the SYREMIS/GRASP approach facilitates the transfer of information content from instruments with richer information content to those with lower one. This results in substantial enhancements in aerosol and surface characterization for all instruments within the synergy."

Barbu;Laurent Franchisteguy,Insights into the North Hemisphere daily snowpack at high resolution from the new Crocus–ERA5 product,"The Crocus-ERA5 snow dataset supports Arctic snow monitoring and contributes to the Arctic Report Card. It improves on its predecessor with higher spatial resolution (0.25° vs. 0.75°), enhancing topographic and land cover detail. The product’s performance is assessed in terms of snow depth and cover compared to in situ observations and satellite data. The findings show a notable improvement, though remaining biases appear in boreal forests, where snow–forest interactions are not captured. 
 This article provides an overview of the daily Crocus–ERA5 snow product covering the Northern Hemisphere from 1950 to 2022. It assesses the product's performance in terms of snow depth and cover compared to in situ observations and satellite data. Compared to its predecessor, Crocus-ERA-Interim, Crocus–ERA5 benefits from improved spatial resolution and better atmospheric data assimilation, resulting in more accurate snowpack estimates, especially during spring in Eurasia. The findings show a good match with observations, though biases remain, particularly in some Arctic regions, where the model tends to overestimate spring melt. In low-vegetation areas such as tundra, Crocus–ERA5 may introduce biases due to its limited consideration of interannual vegetation changes, leading to inaccuracies in the simulation of snowmelt. The production of this snow dataset responds to the request of the continental cryosphere community. In particular the French and Canadian government institutions CNRM (National Center for Meteorological Research) and ECCC (Environment and Climate Change Canada) have been involved in monitoring Arctic snow cover as part of the ”Terrestrial Snow” section of the Arctic Report Card since 2017. The Crocus–ERA5 product is freely available on a daily basis and at 0.25° resolution over the 1 July 1950 to 30 June 2023 period (Decharme et al., 2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14513248)."
10.5194/essd-17-7271-2025,True,Earth System Science Data,该论文构建了中国首个高分辨率（0.5 nm光谱分辨率，10×10 km空间分辨率）的晴空地表紫外辐射数据集（1981-2023年），基于ERA5/MERRA2再分析数据和SMARTS模型，填补了大气环境遥感中紫外辐射精细观测的空白。紫外辐射数据直接关联臭氧层监测、大气成分分析（如紫外线与大气相互作用）及太阳能系统优化，属于大气环境遥感技术的重要应用场景。,"['ultraviolet radiation', 'SMARTS model', 'high-resolution dataset']",Qinghai Qi;Yuting Tan;Christian A. Gueymard;Martin Wild;Bo Hu;Wenmin Qin;Taowen Sun;Ming Zhang;Lunche Wang,"First high-resolution surface spectral clear-sky ultraviolet radiation dataset across China (1981–2023): development, validation, and variability","This research presents China's first long-term (1981–2023) hyperspectral ultraviolet radiation dataset with exceptional 0.5 nm spectral resolution. The spectral detail enables precise identification of UV absorption characteristics and atmospheric interactions previously obscured in conventional broadband measurements. These results provide new capabilities for monitoring ozone depletion, and optimizing solar energy systems across China's diverse climatic regions. 
 Solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) plays a fundamental role in the Earth's energy balance, influencing a wide range of processes, including material degradation, biophysical reactions, ecological dynamics, or public health. In this context, the first high-resolution (10×10 km) hourly dataset of surface solar UV under clear-sky conditions over mainland China from 1981 to 2023 is introduced, derived from ERA5 and MERRA2 reanalysis data and a reconstruction based on the SMARTS (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine) spectral model. Leveraging the SMARTS model's accuracy and capabilities, this dataset provides UV data at 0.5 nm intervals between 280 and 400 nm, offering enhanced granularity for wavelength-specific analysis, thus filling a key gap in high-resolution hourly UV data for China. Validation of the UV dataset against ground observations at 37 stations of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) demonstrates strong performance, with a correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias error (MBE) of 0.919, 5.07 W m−2 and −0.07 W m−2, respectively. Compared with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) UV product, this dataset offers higher spatial and temporal resolution as well as higher accuracy in comparison with observations, thus enhancing data quality for a wide range of applications. The spatial and temporal distribution of clear-sky UV radiation exhibits distinct regional and seasonal variations, with higher values in the west and south, and lower values in the east and north. Over the past 43 years, the annual mean clear-sky broadband UV radiation averaged over China was 20.05 W m−2, showing a slightly increasing trend (+0.0237 W m−2 yr−1). This dataset is now available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28234298 (Qi et al., 2025), offering a valuable resource for addressing regional challenges related to UV radiation."

Additionally, droughts during El Niño events significantly lower the GWL, the main environmental factor that controls greenhouse gas (GHG; carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane) emissions in peatlands. Consequently, tropical peatlands have been recognized as a significant source of carbon emissions, and these emissions have been estimated for the region using constant decomposition rates of peat for each land use (Tier 1 emission factors). However, these factors hardly reflect the spatiotemporal variation of the GWL. Furthermore, these estimates do not account for CO2 uptake through photosynthesis. To reduce uncertainty, we developed a method to estimate spatiotemporal GWL variation from satellite‐derived antecedent precipitation. Using the estimated GWL, we calculated the monthly net ecosystem‐scale GHG emissions from peat forests and managed peatlands using the observed relationship between eddy covariance GHG fluxes and GWL, though carbon losses from deforestation, fires, and fluvial export were not covered in this study. Spatiotemporal variations in GHG emissions across Sumatra, Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula over a decade revealed the following: (a) Peat forests are a net source of CO2‐equivalent GHGs, even when undrained, (b) Decadal mean annual GHG emission rates increase 2.8‐fold when forests are drained and 6.4‐fold when undrained forests are converted to managed peatlands, (c) Droughts increase total annual GHG emissions by 16% across the study area. Additionally, climate models projected precipitation increase in the mid‐21st century, suggesting an increase in GWL and a consequent reduction in peat decomposition."

However, the seasonality and geographic profile of these changes remain unclear. Here, we reveal an anthropogenic‐forced seasonal change in the land–sea thermal contrast by analyzing the evolution of its temperature annual cycle (TACL–S). We find a significant reduction in TACL–S in the northern mid‐latitudes, dominated by stronger winter land warming, alongside an increase in the northern high latitudes, dominated by stronger winter sea warming, during 1941–2014. In particular, these anthropogenic changes are projected to intensify in 2015–2100, with an additional emergence of TACL–S increases dominated by summer land warming in the southern mid‐latitudes. Thus, a future tripolar pattern of TACL–S heralds novel land–sea climate regimes with far‐reaching climatic impacts."

Here we use a simple metric, the Arctic residence time of air, that is, the time air spends uninterruptedly north of 70° ${}^{\circ}$N, to evaluate how these changes have affected the high‐latitude atmospheric circulation in the last 40 years. We find that, on average, near‐surface air resides between 7 (winter) and 12 (summer) days in the Arctic. This residence time has decreased almost year‐round since the 1980s, especially pronounced in the seasonal transition periods (fall: − ${-}$0.9 days; spring: − ${-}$1.4 days). The more pronounced reduction in spring also affects higher atmospheric layers. Our analysis indicates that this reduction is likely linked to the observed sea ice loss, decrease in snow cover, and increase in temperature. Furthermore, it indicates a speed‐up of the circulation, effectively making the Arctic less isolated and more prone to influences from mid‐latitudes."

At Sumisu Caldera, trapdoor faulting has recurred quasi‐regularly, roughly at ∼10‐year intervals, generating earthquakes of moment magnitude 5.4–5.7 and producing tsunamis due to meter‐scale co‐seismic uplift. To assess event similarity and infer controlling factors, we compare seismic and tsunami waveforms at broadband period range (0.2–500 s). The 1996, 2015, and 2024 events exhibit nearly identical waveforms, indicating rupture of a persistent major asperity with stable geometry and processes. Similar but non‐identical earthquakes suggest partial rupture or additional minor asperities. Comparable repeating sequences at other submarine calderas further support that trapdoor faulting is generally governed by major asperities, while variations in recurrence patterns may reflect differences in fault properties among calderas. These results demonstrate that trapdoor faulting recurrency is controlled by major asperities on ring faults, sustained by long‐term, stable magma supply."

The strength of PWV–precipitation coupling varies systematically with latitude and precipitation regime: high‐elevation convective regions show strong coupling across timescales, while extratropical areas dominated by stratiform precipitation exhibit weaker annual and monthly but moderate daily relationships. Seasonal PWV ranges from ∼ ${\sim} $40 mm in the tropics to ∼ ${\sim} $6 mm in subpolar regions, yet precipitation varies inversely.

We examined the influence of marine‐sourced sediment on salt marsh stability across 103 sites in the Northeastern US, using a new satellite‐derived suspended sediment concentration (SSC) product. Marsh vulnerability was assessed using the Unvegetated‐to‐Vegetated Ratio (UVVR) and relative marsh elevation (Z*). We identified two thresholds: SSC >20 mg/L and RSLR <5.2 mm/year. Marshes meeting either threshold tended to remain intact, while those with both low SSC and high RSLR were more vulnerable to degradation. A north–south gradient was observed, with most unstable marshes in the southern region, where SSC declined by 0.9% per decade on average, compared to 0.072% in the north.

Maximum co‐occurrence occurs at zero lag, suggesting synchronous synoptic‐scale atmospheric forcing, likely via air–sea heat fluxes. Co‐occurrence shows strong seasonality, peaking in fall and weakening in summer, and declines exponentially with distance, with an e‐folding scale O(100 km), consistent with synoptic‐scale atmospheric forcing.

However, due to the well‐known “double penalty” effect, MSE‐based losses often lead to overly smoothed prediction fields and a systematic underestimation of the frequency of heavy rainfall. To address this limitation, we propose a novel probability‐matching (PM) based loss for ML precipitation nowcasting and short‐term forecasting, comparing its performance with other classical losses. Comprehensive skill evaluation demonstrates that PM‐based loss offers relatively more balanced and consistent performance across metrics, particularly its lower forecast bias from light to heavy rainfall intensities. Spectral power analysis further indicates that PM‐based loss better preserves small‐scale precipitation variability throughout the forecast period. Additionally, it results in a forecast frequency distribution of precipitation that more closely aligns with the observed distribution. These findings indicate consistent improvements in predictive skill and reliability of ML precipitation forecasts when trained with the PM‐based loss."

Results indicate that 14.33% of the earthquakes can be interpreted by the external excitation of anomalies. Proposed ETAS + ULF + CO model achieves an overall probability gain of 1,013.55 in forecasting 218 earthquakes compared to the purely temporal ETAS model. Statistical significance is assessed by fitting the same model to the same earthquake catalog but with randomized anomaly occurrence times, confirming that the performance improvement is not due to overfitting.

However, distinguishing between key magnetospheric regions–such as inner belt, slot region, outer belt, and plasma sheet–based on low‐altitude data remains challenging, particularly for missions lacking pitch‐angle resolution. A commonly used boundary indicator, the flux anisotropy (i.e., precipitating‐to‐trapped flux ratio), is unavailable in such cases. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to identify the plasma sheet—radiation belt interface, commonly associated with the isotropy boundary, using high energy‐resolution measurements from the Colorado Inner Radiation Belt Experiment (CIRBE) CubeSat. We demonstrate that this boundary is marked by a distinct spectral change: a power‐law form in the plasma sheet transitions to an exponential form within the outer radiation belt. These findings are supported by comparisons with Polar‐orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) observations, and we discuss the potential mechanisms responsible for the spectral transition."

In high ALI years when the Aleutian Low is weakened, the RI ratio is significantly reduced over the region spanning 5°N–25°N, 135°E–160°E, predominantly driven by enhanced 850–200‐hPa vertical wind shear (VWS). Other commonly investigated RI‐related environmental variables show only small ALI‐driven modulations over the primary focus region of this study. In high ALI years, enhanced VWS is mainly induced by anomalous westerlies in the southeastern part of a broad anomalous cyclone centered in the subtropical central North Pacific.

In this study we find that subsurface temperature variability near the ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea Embayment from a global ocean‐sea ice model is able to track observed temperature variability and satellite‐derived basal melt rates. Simulated ocean temperature variability is controlled by a two‐stage response to the regional winds. A weakening of the prevailing southeasterly winds initially redistributes heat by lifting the thermocline, bringing warm mCDW up from depth near the ice shelf front. This is followed by a lagged widespread warming across the continental shelf due to water mass property changes, driven by horizontal advection and vertical mixing.

To investigate this, we perform model experiments that increase CO2 concentrations while imposing the intermodel spread in the AMOC decline. We find that this intermodel spread in the AMOC decline reproduces 45% of the total intermodel spread in Arctic warming. A smaller AMOC decline increases Arctic warming via increased northward ocean heat transport, atmospheric moisture transport, and positive Arctic feedbacks. Arctic warming is more sensitive to AMOC differences that produce larger sea‐ice changes. Combined with a strong correlation between a small AMOC decline and Arctic warming across models, these results indicate that ocean circulation is a key source of model uncertainty in projections of Arctic warming."

We conduct laboratory fluid injection experiments on representative faults with distinct surface mineralogy, injecting fluid at a constant rate of 0.6 mL/min and under a confining pressure of 20 MPa, to examine how mineralogy affects fluid‐driven slip and seismicity. We find that the fault surface with a higher content of tectosilicates (quartz, microcline, albite, totaling 96%) exhibit higher shear strength. The tectosilicate‐rich fault takes a longer time to reactivate but accumulates seismic moment more rapidly, indicating more intense seismicity. In contrast, the fault containing abundant phyllosilicates (50% biotite) promotes a transition from unsteady stick‐slip to steady slip during fluid injection. Stick‐slip events in the tectosilicate‐rich fault exhibit higher peak slip rates and greater slip displacements.

At week 24, mazdutide significantly reduced HbA1c versus placebo (primary endpoint): -1.57% with mazdutide 4 mg and -2.15% with mazdutide 6 mg, versus -0.14% with placebo, with treatment differences of -1.43% and -2.02% (both p <0.0001). Significant weight loss at week 24 occurred with -5.61% (4 mg) and -7.81% (6 mg) versus -1.26% (placebo) (both p<0.0001). Additionally, significantly more participants with mazdutide achieved clinically relevant HbA1c target (<7.0%), weight loss goal (≥5%), and composite endpoints (HbA1c <7.0% and weight loss ≥5%) versus placebo (all p <0.0001). The most common adverse events—diarrhoea, decreased appetite, and nausea—were consistent with GLP-1R agonists.

Macrae;Feng Zhang,Transient hepatic reconstitution of trophic factors enhances aged immunity,"Using lipid nanoparticle delivery of mRNAs to the liver in aged mice, T cell function and declining immune cues can be restored. 
 Ageing erodes human immunity, in part by reshaping the T cell repertoire, leading to increased vulnerability to infection, malignancy and vaccine failure1–3. Attempts to rejuvenate immune function have yielded only modest results and are limited by toxicity or lack of clinical feasibility1,3–5. Here we show that the liver can be transiently repurposed to restore age-diminished immune cues and improve T cell function in aged mice. These immune cues were found by performing multi-omic mapping across central and peripheral niches in young and aged animals, leading to the identification of Notch and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) pathways, together with interleukin-7 (IL-7) signalling, as declining with age. Delivery of mRNAs encoding Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1), FLT3L and IL-7 to hepatocytes expanded common lymphoid progenitors, boosted de novo thymopoiesis without affecting haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) composition, and replenished T cells while enhancing dendritic cell abundance and function. Treatment with these mRNAs improved peptide vaccine responses and restored antitumour immunity in aged mice by increasing tumour-specific CD8+ infiltration and clonal diversity and synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade. These effects were reversible after dosing ceased and did not breach self-tolerance, in contrast to the inflammatory and autoimmune liabilities of recombinant cytokine treatments6,7. These findings underscore the promise of mRNA-based strategies for systemic immune modulation and highlight the potential of interventions aimed at preserving immune resilience in ageing populations. Using lipid nanoparticle delivery of mRNAs to the liver in aged mice, T cell function and declining immune cues can be restored."

 The human gut microbiome is composed of a highly diverse consortia of species that are continually evolving within and across hosts1,2. The ability to identify adaptations common to many human gut microbiomes would show not only shared selection pressures across hosts but also key drivers of functional differentiation of the microbiome that may affect community structure and host traits. However, the extent to which adaptations have spread across human gut microbiomes is relatively unknown. Here we develop a new selection scan statistic named the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS) that can detect sweeps of adaptive alleles spreading across host microbiomes by migration and horizontal gene transfer. Specifically, iLDS leverages signals of hitchhiking of deleterious variants with a beneficial variant. Application of the statistic to around 30 of the most prevalent commensal gut species from 24 human populations around the world showed more than 300 selective sweeps across species. We find an enrichment for selective sweeps at loci involved in carbohydrate metabolism, indicative of adaptation to host diet, and we find that the targets of selection differ significantly between industrialized populations and non-industrialized populations. One of these sweeps is at a locus known to be involved in the metabolism of maltodextrin—a synthetic starch that has recently become a widespread component of industrialized diets. In summary, our results indicate that recombination between strains fuels pervasive adaptive evolution among human gut commensal bacteria, and strongly implicate host diet and lifestyle as critical selection pressures. Development and application of the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS) reveals both selective pressures impacting the human gut microbiome and the mechanisms by which gut bacteria adapt to meet them."

 G-protein-coupled receptors act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and facilitate the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by exchanging GDP for GTP1. This exchange function is not unidirectional2. Here we demonstrate that an agonist can show selective affinity for an active state that prefers the release of GTP. Specifically, for the mu opioid receptor, we show that several agonists have state-selective affinities for promoting GTP release versus GTP binding. We identify two agonists that show a marked preference for promoting release. In mice, marginally efficacious doses of the release-preferring agonist enhance and prolong the antinociceptive effects of morphine and fentanyl without enhancing the respiratory and cardiac effects of fentanyl. Although these observations are limited to simple measures of thermal nociception, they may point to a way to bifurcate physiological responses to such agonists. We propose that the active-state selectivity of an agonist may determine the preferred direction of the receptor GEF function, which may affect the kinetics and selectivity of the engagement of the receptor with downstream effectors; this may ultimately present a means to disentangle multifaceted drug-induced physiological responses. Mu opioid receptor agonists with a preference for the non-GTP-bound state of the G protein promote GTP release, thereby potentiating antinociceptive effects of drugs such as morphine and fentanyl without also increasing their respiratory or cardiac effects."

 Ising machines offer a compelling approach to addressing NP-hard problems1, but physical realizations that are simultaneously scalable, reconfigurable, fast and stable remain elusive. Quantum annealers, such as D-Wave’s cryogenic hardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of qubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs2. Here we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin representation. Inspired by Hopfield networks3, our architecture solves fully connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings) and >41,000 spins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system makes use of cascaded thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and a digital signal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating potential >200 giga operations per second (GOPS) for spin coupling and nonlinearity. This platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic Ising machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate best-in-class solution quality for max-cut problems of arbitrary graph topologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain ground-state solutions for number partitioning4 and lattice protein folding5—benchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system uses inherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate convergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP—traditionally used in optical communications—within optical computation enhances convergence and solution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for optimization, neuromorphic processing and analogue artificial intelligence.

 The dynamic three-dimensional (3D) organization of the human genome (the 4D nucleome) is linked to genome function. Here we describe efforts by the 4D Nucleome Project1 to map and analyse the 4D nucleome in widely used H1 human embryonic stem cells and immortalized fibroblasts (HFFc6). We produced and integrated diverse genomic datasets of the 4D nucleome, each contributing unique observations, which enabled us to assemble extensive catalogues of more than 140,000 looping interactions per cell type, to generate detailed classifications and annotations of chromosomal domain types and their subnuclear positions, and to obtain single-cell 3D models of the nuclear environment of all genes including their long-range interactions with distal elements. Through extensive benchmarking, we describe the unique strengths of different genomic assays for studying the 4D nucleome, providing guidelines for future studies. Three-dimensional models of population-based and individual cell-to-cell variation in genome structure showed connections between chromosome folding, nuclear organization, chromatin looping, gene transcription and DNA replication. Finally, we demonstrate the use of computational methods to predict genome folding from DNA sequence, which will facilitate the discovery of potential effects of genetic variants, including variants associated with disease, on genome structure and function.

 The science of metabolic profiling exploits chemical compound byproducts of metabolism called metabolites1 that explain internal biological functions, physiological health and disease, and provide evidence of external influences specific to an organism’s habitat. Here we assess palaeometabolomes from fossilized mammalian hard tissues as a molecular ecological strategy to provide evidence of an ancient organism’s relationship with its environment. From eastern, central and southern African Plio-Pleistocene localities of palaeoanthropological significance, we study six fossils from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, one from the Chiwondo Beds, Malawi, and one from Makapansgat, South Africa. We perform endogeneity assessments by analysing palaeometabolomes of palaeosols and the effects of owl digestion on rodent bones to enable prudent ecological inferences. Diagenesis is indicated by metabolites of collagenase-producing bacteria2, whereas the preservation of peptides including those of collagen are identified by proteomics. Endogenous metabolites document biological functions and exogenous metabolites render environmental details including soil characteristics and woody cover, and enable annual minimum and maximum rainfall and temperature reconstructions at Olduvai Gorge, supporting the freshwater woodland and grasslands of Olduvai Gorge Bed I3–5, and the dry woodlands and marsh of Olduvai Gorge Upper Bed II6. All sites denote wetter and/or warmer conditions than today. We infer that metabolites preserved in hard tissues derive from an extravasated vasculature serum filtrate that becomes entombed within developing mineralized matrices, and most probably survive palaeontological timeframes in the nanoscopic ‘pool’ of structural-bound water that occurs in hard tissue niches7. Metabolic and proteomic profiles derived from fossilized skeletal remains of animals enable inferences regarding physiological health and disease as well as diet to provide reconstructions of ancient soil, vegetation and palaeoclimate characteristics."

Allen,Astrocyte CCN1 stabilizes neural circuits in the adult brain,"Neural circuits in adult mouse visual cortex are stabilized by astrocytes, which secrete CCN1, resulting in reduced plasticity and increased maturation of multiple cell types. 
 Neural circuits in many brain regions are refined by experience. Sensory circuits support higher plasticity at younger ages during critical periods—times of circuit refinement and maturation—and limit plasticity in adulthood for circuit stability1,2. How astrocytes, a glial subtype, maintain these differing plasticity levels, and whether they stabilize the properties of sensory circuits in adulthood, remain largely unclear. Here we take a comprehensive approach to address these questions and establish astrocytes as key orchestrators of circuit stability. Combining a transcriptomic approach with ex vivo electrophysiology and in vivo imaging, we identify that astrocytes release CCN1 (refs. 3,4) to maintain synapse and circuit stability in the adult visual cortex. Overexpressing CCN1 in astrocytes during the critical period promotes the maturation of inhibitory neurons, limits ocular dominance plasticity and promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. Conversely, knocking out astrocyte CCN1 in adults destabilizes binocular circuits and reduces myelination. This establishes CCN1 as an astrocyte-secreted factor that stabilizes neuronal circuits by coordinating the maturation state of multiple cell types, and demonstrates that the composition and properties of sensory circuits require ongoing maintenance in adulthood, and that these maintenance cues are provided by astrocytes. Neural circuits in adult mouse visual cortex are stabilized by astrocytes, which secrete CCN1, resulting in reduced plasticity and increased maturation of multiple cell types."

 Phosphorus atoms in silicon represent a promising platform for quantum computing, as their nuclear spins exhibit coherence times over seconds1,2 with high-fidelity readout and single-qubit control3. By placing several phosphorus atoms within a radius of a few nanometres, they couple by means of the hyperfine interaction to a single, shared electron. Such a nuclear spin register enables high-fidelity multi-qubit control4 and the execution of small-scale quantum algorithms5. An important requirement for scaling up is the ability to extend high-fidelity entanglement non-locally across several spin registers. Here we address this challenge with an 11-qubit atom processor composed of two multi-nuclear spin registers that are linked by means of electron exchange interaction. Through the advancement of calibration and control protocols, we achieve single-qubit and multi-qubit gates with all fidelities ranging from 99.10% to 99.99%. By entangling all combinations of local and non-local nuclear-spin pairs, we map out the performance of the processor and achieve state-of-the-art Bell-state fidelities of up to 99.5%. We then generate Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states with an increasing number of qubits and show entanglement of up to eight nuclear spins. By establishing high-fidelity operation across interconnected nuclear spin registers, we realize a key milestone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom processors.

 Hydrogen (H2) will play a part in decarbonizing the global energy system1. However, hydrogen interacts with methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapour, leading to an indirect 100-year global warming potential of 11 ± 4 (refs. 2–5). This raises concerns about the climate consequences of increasing H2 use under future hydrogen economies3,5. A comprehensive accounting of H2 sources and sinks is essential for assessing changes and mitigating environmental risks. Here we analyse trends in global H2 sources and sinks from 1990 to 2020 and construct a comprehensive budget for the decade 2010–2020. H2 sources increased from 1990 to 2020, primarily because of the oxidation of methane and anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds, biogenic nitrogen fixation, and leakage from H2 production. Sinks also increased in response to rising atmospheric H2. Estimated global H2 sources and sinks averaged 69.9 ± 9.4 Tg yr−1 and 68.4 ± 18.1 Tg yr−1, respectively, for 2010–2020. Regionally, Africa and South America contained the largest sources and sinks of H2, whereas East Asia and North America contributed the most H2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. We estimate that rising atmospheric H2 between 2010 and 2020 contributed to an increase in global surface air temperature (GSAT) of 0.02 ± 0.006 °C. GSAT impacts of changing atmospheric H2 in future marker Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios are estimated to remain within 0.01–0.05 °C, depending on H2 usage, leakage rates and CH4 emissions that influence photochemical H2 production.

 Many topological phases host gapless boundary modes that can be markedly modified by electronic interactions. Even for the long-studied edge modes of quantum Hall phases1,2, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional electron systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive. Despite advances made using local probes3–13, key experimental challenges persist: the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile for co-propagating modes and induce unexpected edge valley polarization, which differs from the bulk. Although some of our findings can be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture, highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes scanning tunnelling microscopy as a promising tool for exploring the edge physics of the rapidly expanding group of two-dimensional topological phases, including recently realized fractional Chern insulators. Scanning tunnelling microscopy is used to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate their interaction-driven restructuring."

Lunine,Titan’s strong tidal dissipation precludes a subsurface ocean,"Reanalysis of radiometric data from Cassini indicates that Titan does not contain a subsurface ocean, as strong tidal dissipation observed in its gravity field is not consistent with the presence of a liquid layer. 
 The Cassini mission provided unprecedented insights into Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, from its atmosphere to the deep interior1. The moon’s large measured response to the tides exerted by Saturn was interpreted as evidence of the existence of a subsurface ocean2,3. This response, twice the value predicted in pre-Cassini studies, has escaped complete explanation. Here we show that the signature of tidal dissipation in Titan’s gravity field is not consistent with the presence of an ocean. Our results arise from the detection of this signature through a reanalysis of the radiometric data acquired by Cassini with improved techniques. We found that substantial energy is being dissipated in the interior (approximately 3–4 TW, corresponding to a tidal quality factor Q ≈ 5), consistent with recent studies of Titan’s rotational state4. Because the presence of a liquid layer reduces the tidal dissipation generated below it5, these new measurements preclude the existence of a subsurface ocean on Titan and are explained by a model in which dissipation is concentrated in a high-pressure ice layer close to its melting point. This model also reproduces Titan’s observed rotational state and static gravity field self-consistently, reconciling all available geophysical measurements. Efficient ice shell convection can prevent widespread melting and ocean formation, but a slushy high-pressure ice layer is consistent with expectations6, indicating that it probably hosts liquid water pockets. The forthcoming Dragonfly mission to Titan will provide a further test of whether a subsurface ocean exists. Reanalysis of radiometric data from Cassini indicates that Titan does not contain a subsurface ocean, as strong tidal dissipation observed in its gravity field is not consistent with the presence of a liquid layer."

 The development of complex multicellular human in vitro systems holds great promise for modelling disease and advancing drug discovery and tissue engineering1. In the liver, despite the identification of key signalling pathways involved in hepatic regeneration2,3, in vitro expansion of human hepatocytes directly from fresh patient tissue has not yet been achieved, limiting the possibility of modelling liver composite structures in vitro. Here we first developed human hepatocyte organoids (h-HepOrgs) from 28 different patients. Patient-derived hepatocyte organoids sustained long-term expansion of hepatocytes in vitro and maintained patient-specific gene expression and bile canaliculus features and function of the in vivo tissue. After transplantation, expanded h-HepOrgs rescued the phenotype of a mouse model of liver disease. By combining h-HepOrgs with portal mesenchyme and our previously published cholangiocyte organoids4–6, we generated patient-specific periportal liver assembloids that retain the histological arrangement, gene expression and cell interactions of periportal liver tissue, with cholangiocytes and mesenchyme embedded in the hepatocyte parenchyma. We leveraged this platform to model aspects of biliary fibrosis. Our human periportal liver assembloid system represents a novel in vitro platform to investigate human liver pathophysiology, accelerate drug development, enable early diagnosis and advance personalized medicine.

 The human reproductive tract is essential for species perpetuation and overall health. Its development involves complex processes of sex specification, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, the disruption of which can cause lifelong issues, including infertility1–5. Here we present an extensive single-cell and spatial multi-omic atlas of the human reproductive tract during prenatal development to provide insights beyond those that are possible with smaller-scale, organ-focused studies. We describe potential regulators of sexual dimorphism in reproductive organs and pinpoint previously unknown genes involved in Müllerian duct emergence and regression and urethral canalization of the penis. By combining histological features with gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, we define transcription factors and signalling events potentially involved in the regionalization of the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts. We also refine how the HOX code is established in distinct reproductive organs and reveal that the expression of thoracic HOX genes is increased in the rostral mesenchyme of the fallopian tube and epididymis. Our findings further indicate that epithelial regionalization of the fallopian tube and epididymis, which probably contribute to sperm maturation and capacitation, is established during development. By contrast, later events are necessary for regionalization of the uterocervical canal epithelium. Finally, on the basis of single-cell data and fetal-derived organoids, we show that the fetal uterine epithelium is vulnerable to oestrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors. By mapping sex-specific reproductive tract regionalization and differentiation at the cellular level, our study provides valuable insights into causes and potential treatments of developmental reproductive disorders.

Burda,Lesion-remote astrocytes govern microglia-mediated white matter repair,"After spinal cord injury, lesion-remote astrocytes acquire heterogeneous, spatially restricted reactivity states that shape neuroinflammation, neural repair and neurological recovery. 
 Spared regions of the damaged central nervous system undergo dynamic remodelling and exhibit a remarkable potential for therapeutic exploitation1. Lesion-remote astrocytes (LRAs), which interact with viable neurons and glia, undergo reactive transformations whose molecular and functional properties are poorly understood2. Here, using multiple transcriptional profiling methods, we investigated LRAs from spared regions of mouse spinal cord following traumatic spinal cord injury. We show that LRAs acquire a spectrum of molecularly distinct, neuroanatomically restricted reactivity states that evolve after spinal cord injury. We identify transcriptionally unique reactive LRAs in degenerating white matter that direct the specification and function of local microglia that clear lipid-rich myelin debris to promote tissue repair. Fuelling this LRA functional adaptation is the secreted matricellular protein CCN1. Loss of astrocyte-derived CCN1 results in excessive, aberrant activation of local microglia, characterized by abnormal molecular specification, impaired debris processing reflected by the intracellular accumulation of myelin and axon debris, and dysregulated lipid metabolism with distinctive attenuation in lipid droplet accumulation. Mechanistically, we find that CCN1 binds microglial SDC4 to augment lipid storage, linking this signalling axis to a vital repair-associated lipid buffering response in debris-clearing microglia. Accordingly, microglial deficits resulting from astrocyte CCN1 depletion culminate in blunted clearance of white matter debris and impaired neurological recovery from spinal cord injury. Ccn1-expressing white matter astrocytes are induced by local myelin damage and are generated in diverse demyelinating disorders in mice and humans, pointing to their fundamental, evolutionarily conserved role in white matter repair. Our findings show that context-specific cues shape regionally distinct LRA reactivity states with functional adaptations that orchestrate multicellular processes underlying neural repair and influence disease outcome. After spinal cord injury, lesion-remote astrocytes acquire heterogeneous, spatially restricted reactivity states that shape neuroinflammation, neural repair and neurological recovery."

 The apparent invariance of the strong nuclear force under combined charge conjugation and parity (CP) remains an open question in modern physics1,2. Precision experiments with heavy atoms and molecules can provide stringent constraints on CP violation via searches for effects due to permanent electric dipole moments and other CP-odd properties in leptons, hadrons and nuclei3. Radioactive molecules have been proposed as highly sensitive probes for such searches4, but experiments with most such molecules have so far been beyond technical reach. Here we report the production and spectroscopic study of a gas-phase actinium molecule, 227AcF. We observe the predicted strongest electronic transition from the ground state, which is necessary for efficient readout in searches of symmetry-violating interactions. Furthermore, we perform electronic- and nuclear-structure calculations for 227AcF to determine its sensitivity to various CP-violating parameters, and find that a realistic, near-term experiment with a precision of 1 mHz would improve current constraints on the CP-violating parameter hyperspace by 3 orders of magnitude. Our results thus highlight the potential of 227AcF for exceptionally sensitive searches of CP violation.

 The growing demand for advanced materials, miniaturized devices and integrated microsystems calls for the reliable fabrication of complex, multiscale, three-dimensional (3D) architectures, a need increasingly addressed through light-based and laser-based processes. However, owing to the field-of-view (FOV) limitations of conventional imaging optics, existing 3D laser nanofabrication techniques face fundamental challenges in throughput, proximity error and stitching defects on the path to scaling. Here we present a scalable 3D nanofabrication platform that uses a metalens-generated focal spot array to parallelize two-photon lithography (TPL)1 beyond centimetre-scale write field areas. Metalenses are ideally suited for producing submicron-scale focal spots for high-throughput nanolithography, as they uniquely feature large numerical apertures (NAs), immersion media compatibility and large-scale manufacturability. We experimentally demonstrate a printing system that uses a 12-cm2 metalens array to produce more than 120,000 cooperative focal spots, corresponding to a throughput exceeding 108 voxels s−1. By programmatically patterning the focal spot array using a spatial light modulator (SLM), an adaptive parallel printing strategy is developed for precise greyscale linewidth modulation and choreographed printing of semiperiodic and fully aperiodic 3D geometries. We demonstrate parallel printing of replicated microstructures (>50 M microparticles per day), centimetre-scale 3D architectures with feature sizes down to 113 nm, and photonic and mechanical metamaterials. This work demonstrates the potential of 3D nanolithography towards wafer-scale production, showing how TPL could be used at scale for applications in microelectronics2, biomedicine3, quantum technology4 and high-energy laser targets5,6.

 Cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) transports cationic amino acids and plays pivotal roles in cancer proliferation, immune modulation, and nitric oxide metabolism. It also serves as the specific cellular receptor for certain murine leukemia viruses. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of mammalian CAT1 in complex with its substrate ornithine and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Friend murine leukemia virus (FrMLV). CAT1 specifically recognizes the side-chain amino group of ornithine via residue S347 on transmembrane helix 8 (TM8), capturing the transporter in an inward-facing occluded conformation. Notably, the FrMLV RBD (frRBD) primarily engages the third extracellular loop (ECL3) of CAT1—a region marked by substantial species-specific variation that likely governs cross-species viral tropism. Together, our structural and biochemical results elucidate the molecular mechanism of substrate recognition and transport by mCAT1, and unveil the molecular basis for FrMLV receptor specificity. These findings provide a valuable framework for structure-based drug design targeting CAT1 in cancer and infectious diseases.

 Detection of somatic mutations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is challenging due to low variant allele frequencies and extensive DNA degradation. Here we develop a benchmarking strategy using longitudinal patient-matched cfDNA samples from individuals with colorectal and breast cancer. Samples with high and ultra-low levels of tumor-derived DNA are combined into controlled dilution series that preserve the properties of authentic cell-free DNA, including each patient’s germline and blood-cell mutation backgrounds. Using deep whole-genome (150x) and exome (2,000x) sequencing, we define a reference set of ~37,000 single nucleotide variants and ~58,000 indels to benchmark nine somatic variant callers across varying ctDNA levels and sequencing depths. We also explore machine learning–based tuning of individual callers and identify features that improve accuracy in cfDNA. This benchmarking resource clarifies the detection limits of current approaches and provides practical guidance for selecting somatic variant calling methods in liquid biopsy applications.

 A major concern of COVID-19 is immune escape. While T cells are implicated in protection against severe disease, direct evaluation of their capacity to specifically target SARS-CoV-2 variants remains limited. We aim to narrow this gap by profiling the ability of CD8+ T cells to recognize SARS-CoV-2 mutations after vaccination and observe a high degree of phenotype and repertoire diversity. To better understand the breadth of antigen repertoire coverage, we interrogate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 specific TCRs to bind all point mutations of the immunodominant HLA-A2:S269-277 epitope. While mutation space coverage is surprisingly vast, specific substitutions are not recognized by the vaccine-elicited repertoire. Structural analyses reveal a TCR sequence-based antigen recognition limitation intrinsic to vaccination. Further investigation reveals that this repertoire ‘hole’ is not present in the naive repertoire, suggesting future immune escape through these potential escape mutations could be relieved by modifications to vaccines.

 Multivalent metal oxides are promising thermochemical materials (TCMs) for energy storage and conversion owing to their high energy density, air compatibility, and high-temperature stability. Co3O4 serves as a model system for examining particle-size- and structure-dependent redox behavior. While particle size and porosity are known to affect performance, their interplay and the kinetics of pore formation during cycling remain unclear. Here we show the chemical and 3D morphological evolution of Co3O4 micro- and nanoparticles during redox cycles at 800–900 °C using thermal analysis, in-situ synchrotron transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM), and scanning electron microscopy. Thermal analysis shows that nanoparticles re-oxidize more rapidly than microparticles at 800 °C. In-situ nanotomography and chemical imaging reveals that nanoparticles undergo redox conversion without forming internal pores, whereas microparticles develop isolated porosity during reduction. These pores persist through re-oxidation, correlating to a lower conversion rate in subsequent cycles. Our results demonstrate distinct degradation kinetics in Co3O4 micro- and nanoparticles, underscoring the critical role of particle size and porosity in redox performance and informing strategies to enhance the long-term efficiency of metal oxide TCMs. Using operando synchrotron X-ray imaging, the study reveals 3D morphological and chemical changes of thermochemical particles during redox cycles, uncovering degradation mechanisms and insights for improved thermal energy materials."

 The Boson peak (BP), an excess of vibrational density of states, is ubiquitous for amorphous materials and is believed to hold the key to understanding the dynamics of glass and glass transition. Previous studies have established an energy scale for the BP, which is ~ 1-10 meV or ~ THz in frequency. However, so far, little is known about the momentum dependence or spatial correlation of the BP. Here, we report the observation of the BP in model Zr-Cu-Al metallic glasses over a wide range of momentum transfer, using inelastic neutron scattering, heat capacity, Raman scattering measurements, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The BP energy is largely dispersionless; however, the BP intensity is found to scale with the static structure factor. Additional MD simulations with a generic Lennard-Jones potential confirm the same. Based on these results, an analytical expression for the dynamic structure factor is formulated for the BP excitation. Further analysis of the simulated disordered structures suggests that the BP is related to local structure fluctuations (e.g., in shear strain). Our results offer insights into the nature of the BP and provide guidance for the development of theories of amorphous materials.

Here, the authors introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model that embeds robustness directly into the agent decision-making mechanisms through free energy minimization. 
 Despite their groundbreaking performance, autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents – with little or no training – survive in capricious environments. Autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environment conditions become inconsistent.

This study identifies different neutrophil subtypes involved in metastasis, highlighting therapeutic potential of neutrophil subset targeting to inhibit tumor progression. 
 Liver metastasis is a primary cause of death in colorectal cancer, yet the role of immune cells called neutrophils in this process remains complex. In this study, we identify three distinct neutrophil subtypes: anti-tumor high-density neutrophils, pro-tumor mature low-density neutrophils, and immature low-density neutrophils. Here we show that tumor-derived GM-CSF converts anti-tumor neutrophils into a pro-tumor state via the AKT–NF-κB–NFAT5 signaling axis. These activated neutrophils, when further stimulated by CXCR2 ligands, release web-like structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps which promote cancer spread by enhancing cancer cell growth, suppressing immune responses, and preparing the liver for metastasis. Importantly, we demonstrate that using antibodies depleting neutrophils or drugs inhibiting their pro-tumor activity effectively reduces liver metastasis in mice. Our work defines specific neutrophil subsets as key drivers of cancer progression and highlights their therapeutic potential in preventing metastatic spread.

 Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) enables 3D imaging of complex, radiation-sensitive structures with molecular detail. However, image contrast from the interference of scattered electrons is nonlinear with atomic density and multiple scattering further complicates interpretation. These effects degrade resolution, particularly in conventional reconstruction algorithms, which assume linearity. Particle averaging can reduce such issues but is unsuitable for heterogeneous or dynamic samples ubiquitous in biology, chemistry, and materials sciences. Here, we develop a phase retrieval-based cryo-ET method, PhaseT3M. We experimentally demonstrate its application to an approximately 7 nm Co3O4 nanoparticle on an approximately 30 nm carbon substrate, achieving a maximum resolution of 1.6 Å, surpassing conventional limits using standard cryo-TEM equipment. PhaseT3M uses a multislice model for multiple scattering and Bayesian optimization for alignment and computational aberration correction, with a positivity constraint to recover ‘missing wedge’ information. Applied directly to biological particles, it enhances reconstruction quality and reduces artifacts, establishing a standard for routine 3D imaging with phase contrast.

 An accurate assessment of black carbon (BC) climate and health impacts requires knowledge of its mass absorption cross-section (MACBC) – a parameter linking optical and mass measurements. The mean MACBC for freshly emitted soot typically spans a narrow range of 8 ± 1 m2 g⁻1 at 550 nm1,2 but is modified by subsequent atmospheric aging. Determination of MACBC requires simultaneous measurements of aerosol light-absorption coefficient (βabs) and BC mass. Here, we compile 230 measured MACBC values from 80 atmospheric studies and explore the effects of sampling location, study duration, instrumentation, and measurement wavelength. The compiled data set shows a broad variability in MACBC values (a factor of about 200%). We conclude that this variability is attributable to a combination of the above-mentioned effects with additional instrumental uncertainties (e.g., cross-sensitivities and/or inadequate instrument calibration). The current state of knowledge does not support the use of simplistic generalizations or assumptions about MACBC in the atmosphere, motivating a recommendation to further improve and standardize measurement practices."

 The Chang’E-6 (CE-6) mission’s first lunar farside samples return advances understanding of lunar evolution. This achievement highlights the necessity of rapid landing-trajectory reconstruction and precise landing-site characterization for mission execution. We present an intelligent vision-guided framework for lunar exploration, demonstrating that high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction can simultaneously enhance landing site localization accuracy and geological analysis precision.

 Deep-sea sediments enriched in rare earth elements represent important potential resources and paleoceanographic archives. The transfer of these elements from marine particles (e.g., Fe-Mn (oxyhydr)oxides or organic matter) to phosphate phases is essential for their enrichment during early diagenesis. However, the biogeochemical processes driving this transfer remain unresolved. Here, we investigate how microbial reductive diagenesis influences rare earth element enrichment in deep-sea sediments of the northwestern Pacific. By integrating geochemical, magnetic, and microscopic analyses of iron biogeochemical cycling and its signature mineral, biogenic magnetite, we demonstrate that microbial reduction drives the post-depositional mineralization of sinking marine particles. This process releases rare earth elements into porewater, thereby promoting their uptake into bioapatite or authigenic apatite. This mechanism was likely enhanced during past global cooling events that increased ocean productivity. Our findings provide valuable insights for tracing microbial contributions to deep-sea rare earth element enrichment and for investigating their underlying drivers.

 Excessive anthropogenic phosphorus inputs create nutrient surpluses along the terrestrial-aquatic continuum, triggering worldwide water quality challenges. River damming enhances phosphorus retention within river networks and redistributes it among reservoirs, rivers, and coastal oceans. However, the role of reservoirs as phosphorus sinks and their effect on phosphorus export to estuaries remain poorly quantified. We developed a coupled terrestrial-aquatic model to trace phosphorus fate in the highly dammed and fertilized Yangtze River Basin from 1980 to 2018. Our results show that cumulative dam-driven phosphorus retention reached $${4.7}_{3.7}^{5.5}$$ teragrams of phosphorus (median and range), exceeding the cumulative rise in phosphorus loading ($${2.1}_{1.3}^{2.9}$$ teragrams of phosphorus), thereby reversing the anticipated rise in phosphorus export to the estuary. Notably, 40% of dam-induced retention occurred during 2011–2018, despite fertilizer use plateauing around 2010. This strengthened inland water phosphorus sink arises not only from increased damming but also from the continuous release of previously stored phosphorus in terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the key role of legacy effects in controlling the phosphorus temporal dynamics.

 The impact of air temperature on water quality is typically mediated through its influence on water temperature, evaporation, and physicochemical processes.

Here, we employ the fixed effects model to estimate the effects of air temperature on river water quality and elucidate inverted U-shaped responses through 276 Chinese cities from 2014-2020. Our results demonstrate that both single-day high temperatures (>37 °C) and heatwaves (four consecutive days above 35 °C) significantly increase river permanganate index (CODMn) concentration, worsening organic pollution. Additionally, these extreme temperature events contribute over 67% and 10% to quality-based water scarcity, presenting considerable challenges to water withdrawals in cities.

 Tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite suites, dominating Earth’s early continental crust, likely formed by partial melting of hydrated metabasalt, but the specific conditions and mechanisms remain poorly constrained. Here, we conduct thermodynamic-geochemical modeling to systematically compare the roles that pressure, bulk H2O content, and source rock composition play in shaping these ancient rocks. Accordingly, we assess their optimal forming conditions, which are further validated by magmatic H2O contents retrieved from the apatite and zircon crystals of tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite suites. Our results highlight that pressure is the first-order factor controlling the formation and compositional diversity of these rock suites. Those with “high-pressure” geochemical characteristics are derived from fluid-fluxed melting at 14 – 16 kbar, a process readily explained by subduction rather than intraplate geodynamic regime. Furthermore, the temporal and spatial distributions of “high-pressure” variants, coupled with those of arc-like basalts, suggest subduction that likely initiated as a local phenomenon and transitioned to a global-scale process by 3.0 Ga. Pressure plays a primary role in controlling the formation and compositional diversity of tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite suites, with “high-pressure” variants derived from fluid-fluxed melting during subduction, recording the onset of global subduction at ~3.0 Ga, according to thermodynamic-geochemical modeling and mineral hygrometry analysis."

 During the 2023-24 El Niño, the July 2023–June 2024 average global mean surface temperature peaked at 1.58 °C above pre-industrial levels, associated with a record 0.36 °C year-over-year rise. Here we use statistical models and a Green’s Function method to explore the causes for this rise. We show that sea surface temperature accounts for ~92% of the interannual warming, highlighting the critical role of El Niño diversity. Unlike typical El Niños, dual tropical Pacific warming centers in 2023-24 and an eastward-extended North Atlantic jet stream synergistically amplified sea surface temperatures across tropical basins, accelerating the pace of global warming. From an energy balance perspective, ocean heat content accumulated during the preceding La Niña and a continuous increase in absorbed shortwave radiation over the ocean drove sea surface temperature rise. Accelerated warming may push the climate system closer to critical tipping points, emphasizing the need for enhanced monitoring, mitigation, and adaptation strategies.

 Vegetation structure and landscape openness are key ecological factors influencing human behavioural and cultural adaptation strategies. However, there is ongoing debate and lack of quantitative assessment about which vegetation landscape and openness levels were more conducive to hominin dispersal during the early Pleistocene. Here, we selected the early Pleistocene Majuangou archaeological site in China, which is the earliest site in the Nihewan Basin with reliable stratigraphic chronology and abundant archaeological materials, as the research object. We conducted pollen analysis across eight artefact layers and the natural sediments (1.75–1.29 Ma), and carried out the first quantitative reconstruction of vegetation openness. The results demonstrate that vegetation openness in the artefact layers was predominantly between 60% and 90%, while layers with vegetation openness below 50% or above 90% had either no or very few artefacts. The global comparison revealed that hominins’ preference for relatively open habitats was a consistent global pattern, challenging the view that relatively closed forest vegetation landscapes were more conducive to their dispersal. Our findings suggest that enhanced resource abundance, accessibility and mobility in these environments facilitated both hominin dispersal and cultural development, highlighting the pivotal role of relatively open vegetation landscapes in shaping hominin evolution.

 Megathrust faults at subduction zones slip at a broad spectrum of rates from slow creep (centimeters per year) to dynamic rupture (meters per second) with large excess fluid pressures implicated as a control on nucleation style. We report friction measurements on oceanic basalt gouges (IODP Expedition 368X) at elevated temperatures (150°C−450°C), stresses (150 MPa) and large fluid overpressures (30-120 MPa) to represent conditions along the descending slab and to link observed rheology to microtextural evolution. With reducing effective stress, slip instabilities are first manifest as slow-slip and evolve through dynamic stick-slip as a result of reduced shear zone width. This transition in rupture style is driven by an increase in effective fault stiffness k’c and decrease in nucleation length L. Increased intergranular pressure dissolution at elevated effective stress mediates the shear localization width, controls the dynamics of strain localization, and leaves a structurally discernable fingerprint. Our results imply that effective stress-controlled mass transfer, together with strain localization, dictates the styles of instability nucleation manifest as slow earthquakes rationally evolving into dynamic megathrust ruptures. Evolution of slow slip to dynamic rupture on seabed megathrusts in basalt can be explained by strain localization and a transition to strain weakening behaviour encoded as a microtextural signature in triaxial shear experiments on oceanic basalt gouge."
