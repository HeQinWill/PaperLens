10.5194/acp-25-1931-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了云对二甲基硫（DMS）氧化产物的影响，特别是氢过氧化甲基硫代甲酸酯（HPMTF）的损失，以及这如何影响二氧化硫（SO2）和硫化羰（OCS）的生成。研究使用了在亚速尔群岛格拉西奥萨岛进行的长期观测数据，包括卫星测量的云量数据，并结合化学箱模型来评估云处理对HPMTF的影响。结果表明，云是HPMTF的主要损失途径，从而显著减少了DMS衍生的SO2和OCS的生成，进而影响气溶胶的形成。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来研究大气成分的变化，并探讨了这些变化对空气质量的影响。,"['Dimethyl sulfide (DMS)', 'Hydroperoxymethyl thioformate (HPMTF)', 'Sulfur dioxide (SO2)', 'Carbonyl sulfide (OCS)', 'Marine boundary layer (MBL)', 'Cloud processing', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Satellite observations (cloud fraction)', 'Air quality']",Delaney B.

Bertram,Cloud processing of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation products limits sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbonyl sulfide (OCS) production in the eastern North Atlantic marine boundary layer,"We report simultaneous measurements of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and hydroperoxymethyl thioformate (HPMTF) in the eastern North Atlantic. We use an observationally constrained box model to show that cloud loss is the dominant sink of HPMTF in this region over 6 weeks, resulting in large reductions in DMS-derived products that contribute to aerosol formation and growth. Our findings indicate that fast cloud processing of HPMTF must be included in global models to accurately capture the sulfur cycle. 
 Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is the major sulfur species emitted from the ocean. The gas-phase oxidation of DMS by hydroxyl radicals proceeds through the stable, soluble intermediate hydroperoxymethyl thioformate (HPMTF), eventually forming carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Recent work has shown that HPMTF is efficiently lost to marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds, thus arresting OCS and SO2 production and their contributions to new-particle formation and growth events. To date, no long-term field studies exist to assess the extent to which frequent cloud processing impacts the fate of HPMTF. Here, we present 6 weeks of measurements of the cloud fraction and the marine sulfur species methanethiol, DMS, and HPMTF made at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) research facility on Graciosa Island, Azores, Portugal. Using an observationally constrained chemical box model, we determine that cloud loss is the dominant sink of HPMTF in this region of the MBL during the study, accounting for 79 %–91 % of HPMTF loss on average. When accounting for HPMTF uptake to clouds, we calculate campaign average reductions in DMS-derived MBL SO2 and OCS of 52 %–60 % and 80 %–92 % for the study period. Using yearly measurements of the site- and satellite-measured 3D cloud fraction and DMS climatology, we infer that HPMTF cloud loss is the dominant sink of HPMTF in the eastern North Atlantic during all seasons and occurs on timescales faster than what is prescribed in global chemical transport models. Accurately resolving this rapid loss of HPMTF to clouds has important implications for constraining drivers of MBL new-particle formation."
10.5194/acp-25-1949-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注基于空气污染卫星的二氧化碳排放反演系统。论文通过敏感性分析，评估了先验排放、模型分辨率、卫星约束等因素对排放估算的影响，从而评估了该系统的稳健性。研究结果表明，该系统在估算年度国家总氮氧化物和二氧化碳排放量方面表现出较强的稳健性。论文还指出了模型分辨率、卫星约束和氮氧化物排放因子是主要影响因素，并提出了未来优化的方向，旨在提高二氧化碳排放监测的可靠性。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['Air pollution', 'CO2 emissions', 'Satellite observations', 'Emission inversion', 'Nitrogen oxides (NOx)', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition']",Hui Li;Jiaxin Qiu;Bo Zheng,"Air-pollution-satellite-based CO2 emission inversion: system evaluation, sensitivity analysis, and future research direction","We conduct a sensitivity analysis with 31 tests on various factors including prior emissions, model resolution, satellite constraint, and other system configurations to assess the vulnerability of emission estimates across temporal, sectoral, and regional dimensions. This reveals the robustness of emissions estimated by this air-pollution-satellite-based CO2 emission inversion system, with relative change between tests and base inversion below 4.0 % for national annual NOx and CO2 emissions. 
 Simultaneous monitoring of greenhouse gases and air pollutant emissions is crucial for combating global warming and air pollution. We previously established an air-pollution-satellite-based carbon dioxide (CO2) emission inversion system, successfully capturing CO2 and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission fluctuations amid socioeconomic changes. However, the system's robustness and weaknesses have not yet been fully evaluated. Here, we conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis with 31 tests on various factors including prior emissions, model resolution, satellite constraint, and inversion system configuration to assess the vulnerability of emission estimates across temporal, sectoral, and spatial dimensions. The relative change (RC) between these tests and base inversion reflects the different configurations' impact on inferred emissions, with 1 standard deviation (1σ) of RC indicating consistency. Although estimates show increased sensitivity to tested factors at finer scales, the system demonstrates notable robustness, especially for annual national total NOx and CO2 emissions across most tests (RC < 4.0 %). Spatiotemporally diverse changes in parameters tend to yield inconsistent impacts (1σ ≥ 4 %) on estimates and vice versa (1σ < 4 %). The model resolution, satellite constraint, and NOx emission factors emerge as the major influential factors, underscoring their priority for further optimization. Taking daily national total CO2 emissions as an example, the RC‾ ± 1σ they incur can reach −1.2 ± 6.0 %, 1.3 ± 3.9 %, and 10.7 ± 0.7 %, respectively. This study reveals the robustness and areas for improvement in our air-pollution-satellite-based CO2 emission inversion system, offering opportunities to enhance the reliability of CO2 emission monitoring in the future."

Shittu;Kirsty J. Pringle;Stephen R. Arnold;Richard J. Pope;Ailish M. Graham;Carly Reddington;Richard Rigby;James B. McQuaid,Performance evaluation of Atmotube PRO sensors for air quality measurements in an urban location,"The study highlighted the performance of Atmotube PRO sensor particulate matter (PM) data. The result showed inter-sensor variability among the Atmotube PRO sensor data. This study showed 62.5 % of the sensors used for the study exhibited greater precision in their PM2.5 measurements. The overall performance showed that sensors passed the base testing using 1 h averaged data and that a multiple linear regression model using relative humidity values improved the performance of the PM2.5 data. 
 This study presents a performance evaluation of eight Atmotube PRO sensors using US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) guidelines. The Atmotube PRO sensors were collocated side by side with a reference-grade Fidas monitor in an outdoor setting for a 14-week period in the city centre of Leeds, UK. We assessed the linearity and bias for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10. The result of the PM2.5 assessment showed the Atmotube PRO sensors had particularly good precision with a coefficient of variation (CoV) of 28 %, 18 %, and 15 % for PM2.5 data averaged every minute, hour, and day, respectively. The inter-sensor variability assessment showed two sensors with low bias and one sensor with a higher bias in comparison with the sensor average. Simple univariate analysis was sufficient to obtain good fitting quality to a Fidas reference-grade monitor (R2>0.7) at hourly averages, although poorer performance was observed using a higher time resolution of 15 min averaged PM2.5 data (R2 of 0.48–0.53). The average error bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were 3.38 µg m−3 and 0.03 %, respectively. While there were negligible influences of temperature on Atmotube PRO-measured PM2.5 values, substantial positive biases (compared to a reference instrument) occurred at relative humidity (RH) values > 80 %. The Atmotube PRO sensors correlated well with the PurpleAir sensor (R2 of 0.88, RMSE of 2.9 µg m−3). In general, the Atmotube PRO sensors performed well and passed the base-testing metrics as stipulated by recommended guidelines for low-cost PM2.5 sensors. Calibration using the multiple linear regression model was enough to improve the performance of the PM2.5 data of the Atmotube PRO sensors."

Nagao;Kentaroh Suzuki;Makoto Kuji,Retrieving cloud-base height and geometric thickness using the oxygen A-band channel of GCOM-C/SGLI,"In satellite remote sensing, estimating cloud-base height (CBH) is more challenging than estimating cloud-top height because the cloud base is obscured by the cloud itself. We developed an algorithm using the specific channel (known as the oxygen A-band channel) of the SGLI on JAXA’s GCOM-C satellite to estimate CBHs together with other cloud properties. This algorithm can provide global distributions of CBH across various cloud types, including liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds. 
 Measurements with a 763 nm channel, located within the oxygen A-band and equipped on the Second-generation Global Imager  (SGLI) on board the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission – Climate (GCOM-C) satellite, have the potential to retrieve cloud-base height (CBH) and cloud geometric thickness (CGT) through passive remote sensing. This study implemented an algorithm to retrieve the CBH using the SGLI 763 nm channel in combination with several other SGLI channels in the visible, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared regions. In addition to CBH, the algorithm can simultaneously retrieve other key cloud properties, including cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius, ice COT fraction as the cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud-top height (CTH), and CGT. Moreover, the algorithm can be seamlessly applied to global clouds comprised of liquid, ice, and mixed phases. The SGLI-retrieved CBH exhibited quantitative consistency with CBH data obtained from the ground-based ceilometer network, shipborne ceilometer, satellite-borne radar, and lidar observations, as evidenced by sufficiently high correlations and small biases. These results provide practical evidence that the retrieval of CBH is indeed possible using the SGLI 763 nm channel. Moreover, the results lend credence to the future use of SGLI CBH data, including the estimation of the surface downward longwave radiative flux from clouds. Nevertheless, issues remain that must be addressed to enhance the value of SGLI-derived cloud retrieval products. These include the bias of SGLI CTH related to cirrus clouds and the bias of SGLI CBH caused by multi-layer clouds."

Kumjian;Dmitri Moisseev,Benchmarking KDP in rainfall: a quantitative assessment of estimation algorithms using C-band weather radar observations,"Accurate KDP estimates are crucial in radar-based applications. We quantify the uncertainties of several publicly available KDP estimation methods for multiple rainfall intensities. We use C-band weather radar observations and employed a self-consistency KDP, estimated from reflectivity and differential reflectivity, as a framework for the examination. Our study provides guidance for the performance, uncertainties, and optimisation of the methods, focusing mainly on accuracy and robustness. 
 Accurate and precise KDP estimates are essential for radar-based applications, especially in quantitative precipitation estimation and radar data quality control routines. The accuracy of these estimates largely depends on the post-processing of the radar's measured ΦDP, which aims to reduce noise and backscattering effects while preserving fine-scale precipitation features. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several publicly available KDP estimation methods implemented in open-source libraries such as Py-ART (the Python ARM (atmospheric radiation measurement) Radar Toolkit) and ωradlib and the method used in the Vaisala weather radars. To benchmark these methods, we employ a polarimetric self-consistency approach that relates KDP to reflectivity and differential reflectivity in rain, providing a reference self-consistent KDP (KDPsc) for comparison. This approach allows for the construction of the reference KDP observations that can be used  to assess the accuracy and robustness of the studied KDP estimation methods. We assess each method by quantifying uncertainties using C-band weather radar observations, where the reflectivity values ranged between 20 and 50 dBZ.Using the proposed evaluation framework, we were able to define optimized parameter settings for the methods that have user-configurable parameters. Most of these methods showed a significant reduction in the estimation errors after the optimization, with respect to the default settings. We have found significant differences in the performance of the studied methods, where the best-performing methods showed smaller normalized biases in the high reflectivity values (i.e., ≥ 40 dBZ) and overall smaller normalized root-mean-square errors across the range of reflectivity values."

It combines high-accuracy microwave and high-resolution infrared observations for retrieving daily precipitation, a respective sampling uncertainty for a more robust analysis, and monthly means. It is intended and suitable for climate monitoring and research, allowing also studies for water management, agriculture, and disaster risk reduction. A continuous extension from 2023 onwards will be implemented in 2025. 
 Here we introduce the first version of the Global Interpolated RAinfall Estimation (GIRAFE v1), the first dedicated global climate data record for precipitation by the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). GIRAFE is based on precipitation rate estimates obtained from observations by a variety of passive microwave radiometers onboard low-Earth orbit satellites and related retrieval algorithms and frequent and highly resolved infrared observations by geostationary satellites covering all longitudes (Geo-Ring). GIRAFE v1 is available globally at 1-degree resolution as daily accumulations and monthly means for the years 2002–2022, with an implementation of continuous production planned for 2025 onwards. The daily product is accompanied by a dedicated sampling uncertainty estimate based on decorrelation scales in space and time in infrared-based instantaneous precipitation fields. The methods for the generation of GIRAFE v1 are described in detail, followed by results of dedicated quality assessment and intercomparison activities. GIRAFE v1 reproduces reference datasets with a performance similar to established precipitation products, especially as those that are – like GIRAFE v1 – not adjusted to ground-based observations. Likewise, GIRAFE v1 proves to be suitable for the analysis of regional precipitation extremes, e.g. in their relation to sea surface temperatures. The main objective in the production of GIRAFE v1 is climate applications, for which we find the dataset highly suitable according to the dedicated stability and homogeneity analysis. The GIRAFE v1 data record is hosted by CM SAF and is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5676/EUM_SAF_CM/GIRAFE/V001 (Niedorf et al., 2024)."

This includes temperature, salinity, pressure, and currents recorded by instruments deployed in icy, challenging conditions. Our analysis highlights the dominance of tidal currents and separates these from other patterns to study regional energy distribution. This unique dataset offers a foundation for future research on Antarctic ocean dynamics and ice interactions. 
 Continuous moored time series of temperature, salinity, pressure and current speed and direction are of great importance for understanding the continental shelf and under-ice-shelf dynamics and thermodynamics that govern water mass transformations and ice melting in and around Antarctic marginal seas. In these regions, icebergs and sea ice make ship-based mooring deployment and recovery challenging. Nevertheless, over decades, expeditions around the fringe of Antarctica sporadically deployed and recovered hundreds of moored instruments, including those facilitated through ice shelves boreholes. These datasets tend to be archived in a wide range of data centres, with, to our knowledge, no clear format standardisation. As a result, systematic analysis of historical mooring time series in the marginal seas is often challenging. Here we present the first version of a standardised pan-Antarctic moored hydrography and current time series compilation, with broad international contributions from data centres, research institutes and individual data owners. The mooring records in this compilation span over five decades, from the 1970s to the 2020s, providing an opportunity for a systematic study of the pan-Antarctic water mass transport and shelf connectivity. As a demonstration of the utility of this compilation, we present spectral analysis of the compiled current velocity time series, which unsurprisingly shows the dominating presence of tidal variability within most records. This component of the variability is fitted using multi-linear regression to tidal frequencies, and the tidal fit is removed from the original time series to leave detided variability. Recalling that records are limited to months to years in duration, the latter is predominantly composed of synoptic (3–10 days period), intraseasonal (10–80 days) and seasonal (~6 months–1 year) variability. The spatial distribution of the kinetic energy integrated within each frequency band (tidal and non-tidal) is presented and discussed within respective regional contexts, and future avenues of research are proposed. This data compilation is assembled under the endorsement of Ocean-Cryosphere Exchanges in ANtarctica: Impacts on Climate and the Earth System (OCEAN ICE) project (https://ocean-ice.eu/) funded by the European Commission and UK Research and Innovation.

Marsili in 1725, was one of the first treatises to analyse the science of the sea. However, it is difficult to understand Marsili's original data. This paper has undertaken a major effort to re-evaluate Marsili's observations, converting historical measurements into modern units: water weight in water density, bathymetric profiles mapping the locations where these measurements were made, and sea level variations, considering the associated error. 
 The work ""Histoire Physique de la mer"", authored by Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (or Marsigli) and published in 1725, is one of the earliest texts detailing observations of the physical, biological, and bathymetric characteristics of the sea, mainly concentrating on the Gulf of Lion in southern France's Mediterranean area. Nonetheless, understanding Marsili's findings is difficult due to the application of non-standard measurement units and the imprecision of georeferencing data. The MACMAP project (A Multidisciplinary Analysis of Climate Change Indicators in the Mediterranean and Polar Regions), which is funded by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), has involved a thorough recalibration of Marsili's observations. This project focused on transforming water weight measurements obtained from different locations in the Gulf of Lion from June 1806 to January 1807 into water density values. The sampling sites were digitized, bathymetric profiles were reconstructed, and tide amplitudes were examined. The main objective is to make this historical data available to compare with current measurements."

Air masses isolated from land for 72+ hours are systematically selected as essentially oceanic. Among the 11 global regions, they show daytime decreases of 10–16% in the tropics, while near-zero depletions are rare, unlike in the Arctic, implying different mechanisms. 
 Studying tropospheric ozone over the remote areas of the planet, such as the open oceans and the polar regions, is crucial to understand the role of ozone as a global climate forcer and regulator of atmospheric oxidative capacity. A focus on the pristine oceanic and polar regions complements the available land-based data sets and provides insights into key photochemical and depositional loss processes that control the concentrations, spatio-temporal variability of ozone, and the physico-chemical mechanisms driving these patterns. However, an assessment of the role of ozone over the oceanic and polar regions has been hampered by a lack of comprehensive observational data sets. Here, we present the first comprehensive collection of ozone data over the oceans and the polar regions. The overall data set consists of 77 ship cruises/buoy-based observations and 48 aircraft-based campaigns. The data set, consisting of more than 630,000 independent ozone measurement data points covering the period from 1977 to 2022 and an altitude range from the surface to 5000 m (with a focus on the lowest 2000 m), allows systematic analyses of the spatio-temporal distribution and long-term trends over the defined 11 ocean/polar regions. The data sets from ships, buoys, and aircrafts are complemented with an ozonesonde data set from 29 launch sites or field campaigns, and by 21 non-polar and 17 polar ground-based stations data sets. The data were filtered by using backward trajectories calculated with the HYSPLIT model from the individual observation points to extract essentially oceanic observations, defined as air masses that have travelled over oceans for 72 hours or more, which were further tested with the coincident Radon observations. The oceanic and polar data thus selected showed typically flat diurnal patterns at high latitudes and daytime decreases (11–16 %) at low latitudes, indicating the adequacy of the data collection and processing procedures, as well as the potential for further studies of processes with statistical robustness and coverage. The ship/buoy- and aircraft-based data sets presented here will supplement the land-based ones in the TOAR-II database to provide a fully global assessment of tropospheric ozone."

To achieve efficiency, computational costs must be minimized. This paper introduces a novel subgrid approach for linear inertial equations (LIEs) with bed level and friction variations, implemented in the Super-Fast INundation of CoastS (SFINCS) model. Pre-processed lookup tables enhance simulation precision with lower costs. Validations show significant accuracy improvement even at coarser resolutions. 
 Accurate flood risk assessments and early warning systems are needed to protect and prepare people in coastal areas from storms. In order to provide this information efficiently and on time, computational costs in flood models need to be kept as low as possible. One way to achieve this goal is to apply subgrid corrections to relatively coarse computational grids. Previously, these have been used in full-physics circulation models. In this paper, for the first time, we developed subgrid corrections for the linear inertial equations (LIEs) that account for bed level and friction variations. They were implemented in the Super-Fast INundation of CoastS (SFINCS) model version 2.1.1 Dollerup release. Pre-processed lookup tables that correlate water levels with hydrodynamic quantities make more precise simulations with lower computational costs possible. These subgrid corrections have undergone validation through several conceptual and real-world application scenarios, including rainfall-induced flooding during a hurricane and tidal propagation in an estuary. We demonstrate that the subgrid corrections for linear inertial equations significantly improve model accuracy while utilizing the same resolution without subgrid corrections. In terms of computational efficiency, subgrid corrections increase computational costs by 38 %–128 %. However, this yields a 35–50-time speedup since coarser model resolutions with subgrid corrections can provide the same accuracy as finer resolutions without subgrid corrections.

Herein, we present a quorum quenching (QQ)-phage phoresy system to control biofouling by disrupting QS-mediated interactions. This system, which is composed of the QQ bacterium Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans as carriers and hitchhiking lytic phages infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa with active QS systems, significantly decreased QS signal levels, inhibited the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and reduced bacterial abundance in mature biofilms. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that phage treatment upregulated QS and EPS synthesis genes in P. aeruginosa, but the QQ bacteria downregulated QS-related genes, weakening the bacterial EPS secretion and antiviral systems and facilitating phages to infect and lyse the target bacteria. Metabolomic profiling corroborated that the phoresy system disrupted pathways critical to biofilm stability, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. In off-site membrane cleaning experiments, the phoresy system promoted P. nicotinovorans colonization and replaced the niche of P. aeruginosa on the membrane surface, which restored membrane flux (i.e., 90% recovery in severely biofouling systems). Operation studies showed that the phoresy system reduced fouling rates, extended the membrane lifespan, and maintained salt rejection performance for reverse osmosis (RO) membrane systems. These findings highlight the potential of the QQ bacterium-phage system as a sustainable alternative to conventional chemical treatments that damage polymeric membranes."

In this study, we compared Cd and As accumulation in the liver and kidneys of mice with disrupted gut microbiota (administered cefoperazone sodium), restored microbiota (administered probiotics and prebiotics following antibiotic exposure), and normal microbiota, all after consuming cocontaminated rice. Compared to normal mice, microbiota-disrupted mice exhibited 30.9–119% and 30.0–100% (p < 0.05) higher Cd and As levels in tissues after a 3 week exposure period. The increased Cd and As bioavailability was not due to changes in the duodenal expression of Cd-related transporters or As speciation biotransformation in the intestine. Instead, it was primarily attributed to a damaged mucus layer and depleted tight junctions associated with gut dysbiosis, which increased intestinal permeability. These mechanisms were confirmed by observing 34.3–74.3% and 25.0–75.0% (p < 0.05) lower Cd and As levels in the tissues of microbiota-restored mice with rebuilt intestinal barrier functions.

The large‐slip distribution of the 2021 event is well constrained within the depth range 25–45 km, with seaward tsunami observations excluding significant shallower coseismic slip. The 1938 event slip distribution is more uncertain. Regional and far‐field tide gauge observations for the 1938 event are modeled to constrain the location of large coseismic slip. The largest slip (2.0 m) is located below the continental shelf on a 180‐km‐long portion of the rupture extending further northeast than the 2021 rupture, to near Sitkinak Island. Minor slip (1.0 m) extends seaward under the continental slope to 8 km deep, where large slip may have occurred in 1788.

Out of the four clusters, C1 represented localized extreme HREs compared with the other clusters. Interestingly, only the HRE frequency of C1 was found to have a strong negative correlation with PDO. During the negative‐PDO, sea surface temperature increased above 30°N, which decreased the meridional temperature gradient. This weakened the atmospheric circulation and created thermodynamic instability (i.e., weakened upper jet, increased low‐level temperature, higher atmospheric water capacity), creating a favorable environment for HRE in C1. However, this negative‐PDO environment provided somewhat unfavorable conditions for other clusters (C2–C4), so the PDO impact was insignificant."

Hence, accurately reproducing the observed decay pace in state‐of‐art coupled models is essential for realistic climate simulations. In the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models, El Niño decays slower than observed. This slower decay can be attributed to weaker‐than‐observed air‐sea coupling in the models that causes a weaker atmospheric convective response and smaller westerly anomalies along the equatorial Pacific during the El Niño life cycle. The smaller westerly anomalies result in a slower discharge of equatorial ocean heat, weaker negative/positive thermocline anomalies along/off the equator and thus a weaker meridional gradient of the thermocline anomalies. This weakens the easterly current anomalies, diminishes the zonal advection feedback, and ultimately slows the decay pace of El Niño in the models."

Based on observations from Tianwen‐1 and MAVEN, we first report two cases of simultaneous two‐point crossings of the Martian BS affected by an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) event. The findings suggest that high solar wind dynamic pressure, Pd, and interplanetary magnetic field intensity, Bt, within an ICME event have opposite effects on the Martian BS. A high Pd causes the BS to move closer to the planet, while a strong Bt makes it move outward. The precise location of the BS depends on which factor dominates each time under specific ICME conditions. The two examined cases indicate that the Martian BS tends to move outward under an ICME event with a generally large IMF magnitude. The Wang, Xie, et al.

While models indicate that anthropogenic Arctic sea‐ice melting drives this slowdown, observational evidence for this connection remains lacking, leaving the attribution of the AMOC decrease unresolved. In this study, we present causal observational evidence, beyond correlation, that the recent weakening of the AMOC observed in its sea surface temperature (SST) fingerprint is influenced by the decline in summer Arctic sea‐ice concentration over the past century, particularly between the 1950s and 1980s, concurrent with the Great Salinity Anomaly. Using two methods—Convergent Cross Mapping from dynamical systems theory and Information Flow from information theory—we demonstrate that modes of AMOC variability are influenced by sea‐ice melting.

The dynamical downscaled simulations, constrained using spectral nudging, enable the replication of historical events at a higher resolution.

Wang,Variability of Eastern North Atlantic Summertime Marine Boundary Layer Clouds and Aerosols Across Different Synoptic Regimes Identified With Multiple Conditions,"This study estimates the meteorological covariations of aerosol and marine boundary layer (MBL) cloud properties in the eastern North Atlantic (ENA) region, characterized by diverse synoptic conditions. Using a deep‐learning‐based clustering model with mid‐level and surface daily meteorological data, we identify seven distinct synoptic regimes during the summer from 2016 to 2021. Our analysis, incorporating reanalysis data and satellite retrievals, shows that surface aerosols and MBL clouds exhibit clear regime‐dependent characteristics, whereas lower tropospheric aerosols do not. This discrepancy likely arises from synoptic regimes determined by daily large‐scale conditions, which may overlook air mass histories that predominantly dictate lower tropospheric aerosol conditions. Focusing on three regimes dominated by northerly winds, we analyze the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) ENA observations on Graciosa Island in the Azores. In the subtropical anticyclone regime, fewer cumulus clouds and more single‐layer stratocumulus clouds with light drizzle are observed, along with the highest cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), surface cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and surface aerosol levels. The post‐trough regime features more broken or multi‐layer stratocumulus clouds with slightly higher surface rain rate, and lower Nd and surface CCN levels. The weak trough regime is characterized by the deepest MBL clouds, primarily cumulus and broken stratocumulus clouds, with the strongest surface rain rate and the lowest Nd, surface CCN and surface aerosol levels, indicating strong wet scavenging. These findings highlight the importance of considering the covariation of cloud and aerosol properties driven by large‐scale regimes when assessing aerosol indirect effects using observations."

Our findings reveal that surface ozone concentrations increase with the rise in the absolute electric field (|Ez|) of clouds. This phenomenon is linked to the amplification of downdraft magnitudes, which are similarly associated with the |Ez|. Detailed analysis also indicated that stronger downdrafts correlate with higher surface ozone levels. Consequently, the |Ez|‐downdrafts‐O3 interaction forms a coupled system, influenced by the strength of convective clouds. Notably, a more significant effect is observed when the |Ez| surpasses the threshold of lightning activity, leading to an increment of up to 5 ppbv in surface O3. This increment was shown to be independent of downdraft intensity or cloud height, relating solely to the impact of electrical activity. Based on the observational data, a novel parameterization was developed to predict surface ozone concentrations during storms, effectively incorporating the proportional impact of cloud electrification and downdrafts. This phenomenological model provides a robust tool for understanding and forecasting ozone dynamics in storm events in the Amazon rainforest, highlighting the intricate interplay between cloud electricity, downdrafts, and air chemistry in tropical convective storms."

In the dry season (December–April), when low clouds dominate cloud behavior in the Caribbean, Stratocumulus cloud frequency increases at the expense of Cumulus clouds. Low cloud cover varies positively with Stratocumulus clouds and exhibits a slight increasing trend. Rainfall frequency, observed at a subset of co‐located stations, varies positively with Stratocumulus frequency, corroborating their increasing trend. Trends in temperature and humidity show stronger warming aloft compared to the surface and drying at low levels. Stratocumulus are shown to respond positively to increases in the surface latent heat flux and to a stronger inversion in this study region. These results suggest that observed increases in Stratocumulus could be driven by increases in moisture fluxes into the more strongly capped boundary layer. Increased wintertime cloud cover and precipitation frequency may represent a de‐amplifying feedback to Caribbean warming and drying. Climate indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and ENSO do not show significant relationships with Stratocumulus variability, nor do variations in aerosol concentration."

The long‐term trend of the EASM precipitation during the Pleistocene remains hotly debated with two main hypotheses: one suggesting a gradually weakening EASM driven by global cooling, whereas the other proposing a gradually intensifying EASM influenced by the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau or strengthening Pacific Walker Circulation. The primary challenge in resolving this debate lies in disentangling the temperature effects from existing monsoon precipitation proxies, which complicates the interpretation of past climate records. Here, we present a new record of Pleistocene EASM precipitation change from North China, based on soil dolomite and calcite contents that are independent of temperature. Our results indicate increased interglacial EASM precipitation but near‐constant glacial EASM precipitation in the long‐term trend. This finding challenges the conventional view that global cooling weakened monsoon precipitation. We propose that Pleistocene EASM long‐term evolution is controlled by the competition between the monsoon‐weakening effects of global cooling and the monsoon‐enhancing effects of the strengthening Walker Circulation, suggesting that even a cooling climate could strengthen monsoon precipitation.

An initial assessment of this is done by applying a principal oscillation pattern analysis to observations (SWOOSH for Ozone) and reanalysis data (ERA5). This analysis highlights features of the ozone and temperature variability including two peaks in amplitude at different heights in the QBO region as well as more subtle phase differences that cannot be explained by a simple QBO theory. We also quantify the sizes of the ozone and temperature advection terms and show that the contribution of background upwelling on variations in the ozone gradient is not negligible (≈25%) $(\approx 25\%)$. A radiative‐convective equilibrium and photochemical equilibrium model, with the imposed ERA5 QBO variation in upwelling and OSIRIS NOx $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{\mathrm{x}}$ variations, is used to further understand ozone and temperature changes. The results show that photochemistry and transport are important at all levels, and it is misleading to divide the QBO into separate regimes. Prominent aspects of the variability can be reproduced if ERA5 upwelling is reduced by ∼60% ${\sim} 60\%$ between 15 and 50hPa $50\,\mathrm{h}\mathrm{P}\mathrm{a}$ where ERA5 is likely overpredicting the strength of the secondary meridional circulation. Finally, we demonstrate that nonlocality in the vertical plays a major role in QBO dynamics.

Ground validation via district‐level surveys aligns with the findings of our study. Results show 51% of the total crop area was burned (14,700 km2 in Punjab; 8,300 km2 in Haryana), leading to substantial emissions of PM2.5 (54.28 Gg; 7.94 Gg), CH4 (25.63 Gg; 3.75 Gg), CO2 (1,100.3 Gg; 195.7 Gg), NH3 (0.83 Gg; 0.15 Gg), SO2 (0.68 Gg; 0.12 Gg), and CO (62.1 Gg; 11.04 Gg). Emissions in Punjab are about 6.5 times higher than in Haryana attributable to greater burnt area (∼14,700 km2), higher crop yield, and elevated residue‐to‐crop ratios. Compared to VIIRS, Sentinel‐2 data provides approximately 3.6 times higher emission estimates, reflecting improved burnt area detection. District‐level emission variations underscore the influence of diverse farming practices, weather, and residue management. An uncertainty analysis, derived from multiple emissions estimates and methodologies, highlights regional disparities: SO2 exhibits the highest uncertainty in both states with PM2.5 and CO, respectively, showing the least.

We perform statistical analysis of relationships between metrics of MP objects (e.g., duration, size, intensity, and origin) and high‐resolution MCS precipitation characteristics (e.g., duration, total rainfall, rain coverage area, and motion) that occur while collocated with or in the absence of MPs to discern predictive capability of background dynamic features on storm precipitation potential. Although the majority of MPs collocated with MCS initiation occur during July–August, a significant number (40%) occur between May and June. Northwesterly flow MPs comprise a relative minority of our events, suggesting that MPs can affect MCSs across a variety of warm season flow regimes. MPs affecting MCSs initiated primarily over the high plains near the central Rockies. Only approximately 20% of tracked MCS initiation events were collocated with MPs, but these storms produced ∼25% greater lifetime rainfall and coverage area, and ∼29% more stratiform rain than non‐MP‐induced MCSs. In general, larger and more vigorous MPs resulted in more hydrologically impactful MCSs.

This paper introduces a fast and accurate spectral extension algorithm designed to expand CPF‐like spectral radiances beyond the CPF spectral range (0.35–2.3 μm) to align with the CERES SW spectral range for its filtered (0.2–5 μm) and unfiltered (0.2–15.0 μm) radiances, facilitating accurate CPF‐CERES intercalibration. The algorithm demonstrates excellent accuracy in generating the missing energy within the UV and IR segments of the CERES SW range. The standard deviation is 0.2% for the integrated unfiltered radiances and 0.05% for the integrated filtered radiances. The bias is only −0.01% for the unfiltered case and −0.003% for the filtered case. The methodology was validated using measured EMIT radiance data. We employed EMIT radiances within the wavelength range of 0.43–2.25 μm to generate radiances for both the shorter (0.381–0.43 μm) and longer wavelength range (2.25–2.493 μm). The standard deviation in the integrated broadband radiances is about 0.1%, and the bias is less than 0.004% for over 1.5 million EMIT samples. These statistics suggest that the spectral extension algorithm is robust and effective in substantially reducing the spectral difference‐induced uncertainty in the CPF‐CERES intercalibration."

These planets form two populations separated by a natural division at about 1.8 R⊕ termed the radius valley. It is uncertain whether these populations arose from separate dry versus water-rich formation channels, evolved apart because of long-term atmospheric loss or a combination of both5–14. Here we report observations of ongoing hydrogen loss from two sibling planets, TOI-776 b (1.85 ± 0.13 R⊕) and TOI-776 c (2.02 ± 0.14 R⊕), the sizes of which near the radius valley and mature (1–4 Gyr) age make them valuable for investigating the origins of the divided population of which they are a part. During the transits of these planets, absorption appeared against the Lyman-α emission of the host star, compatible with hydrogen escape at rates equivalent to 0.03–0.6% and 0.1–0.9% of the total mass per billion years of each planet, respectively. Observations of the outer planet, TOI-776 c, are incompatible with an outflow of dissociated steam, suggesting both it and its inner sibling formed in a dry environment.

 Ocean alkalinity enhancement is a widely considered approach for marine CO2 removal. Alkalinity enhancement sequesters atmospheric CO2 by shifting the seawater carbonate equilibrium from CO2 towards bicarbonate and carbonate ions. Such re-equilibration has been hypothesized to benefit calcifying organisms, whose increased calcification could strongly reduce the efficiency of alkalinity enhancement. Here we use global ocean satellite data to constrain the sensitivity of coccolithophores—an important group of calcifying phytoplankton—to natural gradients of seawater carbonate chemistry. We show that the ratio of particulate inorganic to particulate organic carbon, reflecting the balance of calcifying versus non-calcifying phytoplankton, is influenced by environmental drivers, including nutrient stoichiometry and carbon substrate within biogeochemical provinces. Across biogeochemical provinces, however, this ratio persistently correlates with carbonate chemistry through combined influences of carbon substrate availability and proton inhibition of calcification. We estimate that extreme alkalinity enhancement may promote the proliferation of coccolithophores, thereby reducing the CO2 removal potential of ocean alkalinity enhancement by 2–29% by 2100. However, less extreme alkalinity enhancement may only mitigate for adverse acidification effects on coccolithophores. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering large-scale biogeochemical feedbacks when evaluating the efficiency of ocean alkalinity enhancement. Intensive ocean alkalinity enhancement will cause a proliferation of calcifying organisms, which reduces its effectiveness as a carbon sequestration approach, according to an analysis of coccolithophore sensitivity to natural carbonate chemistry variability."

Here, the authors show that such an assumption of Hermiticity can be lifted in the context of a lattice model containing two non-Hermitian Dirac cones, with one hosting amplifying Dirac quasiparticles and the other hosting decaying ones. 
 Relativistic quasiparticles emerging from band degeneracies in crystals play crucial roles in the transport and topological properties of materials and metamaterials. Quasiparticles are commonly described by Hermitian Hamiltonians, with non-Hermiticity usually considered detrimental. In this work, we show that such an assumption of Hermiticity can be lifted to bring quasiparticles into non-Hermitian regime. We propose a concrete lattice model containing two Dirac cones with valley-dependent lifetimes. The lifetime contrast enables an ultra-strong valley selection rule: only one valley can survive in the long-time limit regardless of the excitation, lattice shape and other details. This property leads to an effective parity anomaly with a single Dirac cone and offers a simple way to generate vortex states. Additionally, extending non-Hermitian features to boundaries generates valley kink states with valley-locked lifetimes, making them effectively unidirectional and more resistant against inter-valley scattering. All these phenomena are experimentally demonstrated in a non-Hermitian electric circuit lattice. Non-Hermiticity is usually considered detrimental to quasiparticle physics. Here, the authors show that such an assumption of Hermiticity can be lifted in the context of a lattice model containing two non-Hermitian Dirac cones, with one hosting amplifying Dirac quasiparticles and the other hosting decaying ones."

Here, authors substitute the core of Y6 with phenanthroline and crown ether, achieving a certified efficiency of 25.59%. 
 Fullerene derivatives are widely employed as efficient electron-transporting layers (ETLs) in p-i-n perovskite photovoltaics but face challenges in mitigating interfacial recombination losses and ensuring stable film morphology. Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), commonly utilized in organic photovoltaics, present a promising alternative to fullerene-based ETLs. Nevertheless, the suboptimal performance of NFA-based devices underscores the need for molecular engineering to tailor their properties. Herein, we develop two Y-type NFAs, Y-Phen and Y-CE, by substituting the benzothiadiazole core of Y6 with higher-polarity phenanthroline and crown ether. These modifications effectively enhance carrier kinetics by (1) promoting ordered molecular assembly on the perovskite surface through supramolecular interactions, thereby optimizing interfacial energetic alignment, and (2) improving the molecular packing to facilitate efficient charge transport. Using Y-CE as the ETL, the device achieves a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.59%. Furthermore, the optimized device exhibits less than 10% degradation in PCE after 1440 hours of thermal aging.

In this study, the authors show that bacteria have potentially evolved an altruistic trait to auto-degrade after death, thus permitting population nutrient recycling. 
 Bacterial death is critical in nutrient recycling. However, the underlying mechanisms that permit macromolecule recycling after bacterial death are largely unknown. We demonstrate that bacteria encode post-mortem protein catabolism via Lon protease released from the dead bacteria. Growth assays reveal that the lysate of Lon protease-null bacteria does not provide a growth benefit to wild type cells. This deficiency is reversed with exogenous recombinant Lon protease, confirming its post-mortem role and is independent of Lon ATPase activity. Biochemistry, growth assays and metabolomics demonstrate that Lon protease facilitates peptide nutrient release, benefitting living cells and acting as a cooperative public good. We also show that the production of Lon protease cannot be explained by a personal benefit to living cells. Although Lon protease can also provide a benefit to living cells under stressful conditions by helping control protein quality, this private benefit does not outweigh the cost under the conditions examined. These results suggest that Lon protease represents a post-mortem adaptation that can potentially be explained by considering the post-mortem indirect benefit to other cells (kin selection). This discovery highlights an unexpected post-mortem biochemistry, reshaping our understanding of nutrient recycling. Processes that occur after death have not received the same level of attention as the mechanisms of life.

Warmer and fresher waters, along with slowed overturning circulation, reduce the mixed layer, intensifying sea surface temperature variability, suggesting increased global climate extremes. 
 The Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) is a basin-scale mode of sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the North Atlantic, exerting a global impact, including contribution to the multidecadal Sahel drought and subsequent recovery and the post-1998 global warming hiatus. How greenhouse warming affects AMV remains unclear. Here, using models with multicentury-long outputs of future climate, we find an intensified AMV under greenhouse warming. Surface warming and freshwater input from sea-ice melt increase surface buoyancy, leading to a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Reduced vertical mixing associated with suppressed oceanic deep convection results in a thinned mixed layer and its variability, favouring stronger AMV SST variability. Further, a weakened AMOC and the associated northward heat transport prolong the lifespan of the AMV, providing a long time for the AMV to grow. Thus, multidecadal global surface fluctuations and the associated climate extremes are likely to be more intense. This study uses available models to show intensified Atlantic multidecadal variability under global warming.

This study examines the spatial and temporal patterns of this deforestation to understand the effectiveness of current laws at curbing forest loss. 
 The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a global biodiversity hotspot that harbours a high number of endemic species and provides important ecosystem services. However, a long history of deforestation means that only 24% of its original forest cover remains and studies are needed to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of forest loss to better understand the effectiveness of current laws in curbing deforestation in this important biome. Here we provide a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative time-series analysis of mature forest loss within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. From 2010 to 2020, we detected 14,401 deforestation polygons, resulting in a loss of 186,289 ha, most of it with a high likelihood of illegality. These losses occurred mainly in small-sized patches on private lands for agricultural expansion, but also in protected areas and Indigenous lands. Deforestation is concentrated in two hotspots that involve different agricultural actors and land-use change processes. This pattern could lead to species extinctions, ecosystem service losses and a weakened capacity to address climate change, thus challenging the effectiveness of mechanisms currently used to counter deforestation. Implementing further incentive, protection and enforcement measures could aid in progress towards zero deforestation in this critically important habitat.

 Atlantic Niño is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability of the tropical Atlantic, prominently influencing climate conditions over local and remote regions. A recent study has identified two types of Atlantic Niño–central and eastern Atlantic Niño (CAN and EAN), with warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies centered in the central and eastern basins, respectively. Here we investigate their formation mechanisms by performing a mixed layer heat budget analysis and conducting numerical experiments. Results show that the development of both types is contributed by upper-ocean vertical processes caused by westerly wind anomalies. Furthermore, anomalous horizontal advection also plays an important role but is associated with distinct physical processes in the CAN and EAN. The difference is related to the climatological distribution of tropical Atlantic SST, exhibiting two warm centers located in the southwest and northeast tropical basins during boreal spring. Consequently, eastward current anomalies during Atlantic Niño cause warming only in the western-central equatorial Atlantic south of the equator, contributing to the formation of CAN. In contrast, Ekman convergence anomalies cause SST warming in the southwest and northeast equatorial Atlantic during CAN and EAN, respectively, favoring both types.

 Oceanic detachments are deep-rooted, long-lived, plate-scale structures and serve as fluid conduits introducing water into the oceanic lithosphere, impacting plate rheology and potentially inducing oceanic crustal melting. However, the extent and mechanisms of fluid ingress and crustal melting during detachment faulting remains poorly constrained. Here we examine felsic veins from the Atlantis Bank oceanic core complex, Southwest Indian Ridge, to elucidate oceanic detachment controls on crustal melting. We suggest that the felsic veins are products of strong fractionation of either primitive basalts or magmas generated by hydrous melting of gabbros (i.e., anatectic melts). The anatectic felsic veins are proximal to the fault plane, suggesting that detachment fault facilitated high-temperature (750–900 °C) seawater infiltration into deep oceanic crusts. Our findings highlight the essential role of detachment faulting played in the fluid ingress and melting of oceanic crust, bearing implications for chemical and heat exchange between seawater and oceanic lithosphere.

 Recent studies have proposed calcite and dunite as possible alkaline materials for enhanced benthic weathering in shallow depocenters of the Baltic Sea as a marine carbon dioxide removal strategy. In this study, insights on calcite and dunite weathering from laboratory incubations and long-term benthocosm experiments are combined with a numerical box-model to assess the carbon dioxide uptake potential of mineral addition to organic-rich sediments in the southwest Baltic Sea. The results reveal that calcite has an up to 10-fold higher carbon dioxide uptake efficiency and is therefore the preferable material for enhanced benthic weathering as a marine carbon dioxide removal method, with costs per tonne of sequestered carbon dioxide ranging between 82 and 462 euro for calcite while reaching 558–1920 euro for dunite.

 Irrigation expansion and subsequent deforestation substantially affect large basin variability. However, given the complex interactions between hydrological variables, a more comprehensive understanding of the hydrological impacts within the coexisting land use changes is needed. Here, we applied surface-groundwater-coupled simulations with historical river gauges and satellite observations to evaluate long-term and seasonal changes in Lancang-Mekong River Basin hydrology. Increasing irrigation elevated soil moisture but depleted groundwater storage. Conversely, deforestation reduced soil moisture, and increased lateral flow in areas with steep terrain compensated for groundwater depletion. Irrigation affected runoff by augmenting evapotranspiration and baseflow, which had opposite implications for runoff changes, causing a mixed spatial pattern of decreases and increases. Meanwhile, decreases in soil moisture due to deforestation offset increases in evapotranspiration due to irrigation, resulting in wider areas of runoff increases than decreases. These illustrate the distinct hydrological impacts of different land use changes and a pathway to complex system assessments.

 Six of nine planetary boundaries are currently transgressed, many related to human land use. Conversion of sizeable land areas to biomass plantations for Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) – often assumed in climate mitigation scenarios to meet the Paris Agreement – may exert additional pressure on terrestrial planetary boundaries. Using spatially-explicit, process-based global biogeochemical modelling, we systematically compute feedstock production potentials for BECCS under individual and joint constraints of the planetary boundaries for nitrogen flows, freshwater change, land system change and biosphere integrity (including protection of remaining forests), while reserving current agricultural areas for meeting the growing global demand for food, fodder and fibre. We find that the constrained BECCS potential from dedicated Miscanthus plantations is close to zero (0.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year under mid-century climate for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5). The planetary boundary for biosphere integrity has the largest individual effect, highlighting a particularly severe trade-off between climate change mitigation with BECCS and ecosystem preservation. Ultimately however, the overall limitation results from the joint effect of all four planetary boundaries, emphasizing the importance of a holistic consideration of Earth system stability in the context of climate change mitigation.

 This study introduces a novel approach for mapping annual fractional vegetation cover in Sub-Saharan rangelands. We used Sentinel-2 time series data from October 2022 to October 2023 to derive phenological metrics, including the dry season integral and rate of greenness decline after peak season. Phenological metrics effectively separate woody vegetation from herbaceous plants based on their distinct seasonal patterns, enabling knowledge-based identification of woody, herbaceous and bare surface endmembers by extending the traditional spectral feature space to a phenological feature space (PFS). Our method was robust across precipitation gradients, consistently producing a triangular-shaped PFS. The regression-based unmixing model, trained using simulated mixtures generated from pure endmember time series signals, showed promising predictive performance at 10-m resolution. Validation using unmanned aerial vehicle imagery revealed mean absolute errors of 11.87 %, 13.57 %, and 14.47 % for woody, herbaceous, and bare surface cover respectively, with the model explaining 68 %, 58 %, and 62 % of the variance in these respective cover types. The 10-m resolution maps provide a detailed representation of continuous transitions between vegetation types in semiarid rangelands, and detect distinct spatial patterns associated with rangeland management practices, such as woody vegetation removal. The complementary use of phenometrics for knowledge-based endmember selection and full spectral-temporal information as model input yielded better results than using phenometrics alone. Future applications of this method can potentially enable assessment of temporal trends in cover fractions across multiple years. This study represents a substantial advancement in monitoring capabilities for vegetation composition in African semi-arid environments, offering a foundation for more comprehensive understanding of human-environmental interactions in these ecosystems."

 Spatial variability has been one of the major challenges for large-area crop monitoring and classification with remote sensing. Recent works on deep learning have introduced spatial transformation methods to automatically partition a heterogeneous region into multiple homogeneous sub-regions during the training process. However, the framework is only designed for deep learning and is not available for other models, e.g., decision tree and random forest, which are frequently the models of choice in many crop mapping products. This paper develops a geo-aware random forest (Geo-RF) model to enable new capabilities to automatically recognize spatial variability during training, partition the space, and learn local models. Specifically, Geo-RF can capture spatial partitions with flexible shapes via an efficient bi-partitioning optimization algorithm. Geo-RF also automatically determines the number of partitions needed in a hierarchical manner via statistical tests and builds local RF models along the partitioning process to explicitly address spatial variability and improve classification quality. We used both synthetic and real-world data to evaluate the effectiveness of Geo-RF. First, through the controlled synthetic experiment, Geo-RF demonstrated the ability to capture the artificially-inserted true partition where a different relationship between the inputs and outputs is used. Second, we showed the improvements from Geo-RF using crop classification for five major crops over the contiguous US. The results demonstrated that Geo-RF is able to significantly improve classification performance in sub-regions that are otherwise compromised in a single RF model. For example, the partition around downstream Mississippi for soybean classification led to major improvements for about 0.10-0.25 in F1 scores in the area, and the score increased from 0.57 to 0.82 at certain locations. Similarly, for rice classification, the partition in Arkansas led to F1 scores increasing from 0.59 to 0.88 in local areas. In addition, we evaluated the models under different parameter settings, and the results showed that Geo-RF led to improvements over RF in the vast majority of scenarios (e.g., varying model complexity and training sizes). Computationally, Geo-RF took about one to three times more training time while its execution time during testing was similar to that of RF. Overall, Geo-RF showed the ability to automatically address spatial variability via partitioning optimization, which is an important skill for improving crop classification over heterogeneous geographic areas at large scale. Future research can explore the use of Geo-RF for other geographic regions and applications, interpretable methods to understand the data-driven partitioning, and new designs to further enhance the computational efficiency."

 Recent advances in remote sensing technology have facilitated the emergence of high-quality hyperspectral satellite sensors with spatial resolutions comparable to well-established multispectral platforms like Landsat series and Sentinel-2. However, most hyperspectral satellite datasets suffer from limited temporal resolution, hindering the effective monitoring of rapid changes on the Earth's surface. To address this issue, we proposed an innovative fusion strategy named spectrotemporal fusion (SpecTF). Through SpecTF, high-frequency temporal information from multispectral images (MSIs) and narrow-band spectral information from hyperspectral images (HSIs) can be blended for applications that require high resolutions in both temporal and spectral domains. SpecTF first leverages a limited number of historical HSI-MSI pairs to learn the cross-sensor spectral mapping and then fuses this spectral mapping with broad-band time series to reconstruct narrow-band ones. The performance of SpecTF was evaluated using typical satellite datasets across six sites and a suite of field measurements. The average root mean square error (RMSE) and spectral angle of SpecTF are 0.0224 ± 0.0142 and 3.3734 ± 1.5476°, respectively, which represent a 24.83 % and 33.23 % reduction in error compared to the second-best method.

In addition, we propose a simple yet efficient 3D-token serialization approach (Voxel-based Token Serialization, i.e., VTS) for Mamba, where the Bi-Scanning strategy enables the model to collect features from all input points in different directions effectively. The performance of 3D-UMamba on three challenging LiDAR point cloud datasets (airborne MultiSpectral LiDAR (MS-LiDAR), aerial DALES, and vehicle-mounted Toronto-3D) demonstrated its superiority in multi-source LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation, as well as the strong adaptability of Mamba to different types of LiDAR data, exceeding current state-of-the-art models.

 IntroductionThe association between air pollution and mortality has been extensively explored in epidemiological literature in recent decades. Individual factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) and gender have been identified as significant contributors to population vulnerability to the health effects. This study aims to assess how individual (SES), environmental (air pollution) factors and their influence the risk of cause-specific mortality in an administrative cohort of residents of the River Sacco Valley (RSV), a contaminated site of central Italy.Materials and methodsIndividual exposure to pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, C6H6, O3) at residential addresses was evaluated using dispersion models (FARM) with a 1 km2 resolution from the Environmental Protection Agency of Lazio Region (ARPA Lazio). SES was determined by a 5-level area index at the census block level (high to low). Health data, coded with ICD-9 and ICD-10, included non-accidental (0–799 and (A00-R99)), cardiovascular (390–459 and (I00-I99)), respiratory (460–519 and (J00-J99)), and malignancy (140–250 and (C00-C97)) causes of mortality. Residents in the RSV and adjacent area (∼100 municipalities) were enrolled from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018. We used Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for gender, SES, and air pollution to estimate the associations between exposure and outcomes. We also evaluated the interaction between air pollution and SES on the study outcomes. Finally, we estimated the health impact of air pollution by SES category.ResultsWe enrolled 665,160 subjects (median age: 41 years) at the baseline. High SES constituted 8% while low SES 13% of the study population. We observed 59,767 non-accidental deaths during the study period. SES-related estimates show a clear pattern for each outcome, with HR for low SES up to 1.165 (1.097, 1.238) for non-accidental and 1.184 (1.087, 1.290) for cancer mortality. Air pollutants exhibited positive associations with cancer and respiratory mortality only, with estimates up to 1.05 (1.02, 1.07) and 1.06 (1.03, 1.09) for PM2.5 and C6H6. Air pollution-SES interaction estimates were higher in the low SES category, with HRs up to 1.14 (1.07, 1.21) and 1.19 (1.10, 1.29) for non-accidental and cancer mortality with C6H6 exposure. Attributable fraction of causes-specific deaths were higher in lowest SES categories compared to highest ones.ConclusionsSocioeconomic deprivation indicates individual frailty, and air pollution is a major environmental risk factor. However, the association of long-term exposure vary across the population. Higher effects were detected in socioeconomical deprivated subjects.

 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key precursors in ozone formation, and their photochemical losses during atmospheric transport critically influence pollution characterization and source apportionment. The Chengdu-Chongqing region experiences heightened ozone pollution during the summer months. In light of this, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the atmospheric concentrations and photochemical losses of 56 VOC species in Rongchang of Chongqing, a representative city within the Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle from June to September 2023. We employed a combination of Positive matrix factorization and backward trajectory analysis to comprehensively resolve emission sources. The results indicate that not considering photochemical losses could lead to substantial underestimations in VOC concentrations (TVOC, 20.87 %), ozone formation potential (OFP, 27.40 %) and hydroxyl radical loss (LOH, 56.20 %). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, based on the initial and observed concentrations, revealed that the motor vehicle emissions are overestimated by 7.95 % if neglecting the photochemical losses. Conversely, the industrial emissions, natural emissions, fossil fuel combustion, and solvent use sources are underestimated by 70.49 %, 44.24 %, 13.02 %, and 25.07 %, respectively. Backward trajectory analysis identified that industrial emissions predominantly originated from southeastern Sichuan and southwestern Chongqing, while solvent use emissions were concentrated in the main urban area of Chongqing. This study quantifies the impact of photochemical reactions on the characterization of atmospheric VOCs and source apportionment in Chongqing.

 As a natural tracer of the water cycle, the stable water isotopes in precipitation usually show spatial dependency. The geographical zoning of precipitation isotopes provides a spatial perspective to understand the large-scale climatological background associated with isotopic fractionation. Here a Ward hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted on a monthly δ18O product across China with a spatial resolution of 10′ × 10′ (latitude by longitude), and a new zoning scheme for precipitation isotopes in China was designed. According to the intra-annual isotopic variations, the terrestrial area of China was divided into seven subregions in this new scheme, i.e., Northeast China (NE), North China (N), South China (S), arid Northwest China (NWa), extreme arid Northwest China (NWea), cold Southwest China (SWc), and humid Southwest China (SWh). We examined the monthly variations in precipitation isotopes and local meteoric water lines for each subregion. The subregional slopes of local meteoric water lines range between 6.52 (Northeast China) and 8.20 (South China). According to the climate reanalysis data, we quantified the input and output of atmospheric water vapor from the meridional and zonal boundaries for each subregion, and found that the regional isotopic characteristics are consistent with the water vapor budgets. The scheme reveals the large-scale moisture transport of monsoon systems and the topographic effect of plateaus and basins. The new zoning scheme in this study provides fundamental isotopic information for diverse climate backgrounds in China, and is useful for regional studies in the atmospheric, hydrological and ecological fields."

We demonstrate that a wide-ranging carnivore—the northern elephant seal—can serve as an ecosystem sentinel for the twilight zone. We link ocean basin–scale foraging success with oceanographic indices to estimate twilight zone fish abundance five decades into the past, and into the future. We discovered that a small variation in maternal foraging success amplified into larger changes in offspring body mass and enormous variation in first-year survival and recruitment. Worsening oceanographic conditions could shift predator population trajectories from current growth to sharp declines. As ocean integrators, wide-ranging predators could reveal impacts of future anthropogenic change on open ocean ecosystems."

The fate of collective charge excitations, or plasmons, in these systems is a subject of debate. Several studies have suggested that plasmons are overdamped, whereas other studies have detected propagating plasmons. In this work, we present direct nano-optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl2. HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl2. Photoemission data presented here reveal a highly anisotropic Fermi surface, reconstructed and made partly incoherent, likely through electronic interactions as explained by many-body theory. HPPs remain long-lived despite this, revealing previously unseen imprints of many-body effects on plasmonic collective modes."

We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry. The derived seismic hydrographs reveal distinct expressions of groundwater and surficial water droughts: Whereas surface and near-surface water storage nearly fully recovered in the epic wet season of 2023, only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was restored. On a decadal scale, we find substantial depletion in aquifers below 50-meter depth, with only limited storm-related recovery. Our analysis underscores the need to monitor deep aquifers for a more complete assessment of total water deficits, using high-resolution tools such as seismic sensing."

We demonstrate selective chemical looping combustion of C2H2in C2H4-rich streams by Bi2O3as an alternative catalytic pathway to reduce C2H2concentration below 2 ppm. Bi2O3combusts C2H2with a first-order rate constant that is 3000 times greater than the rate constant for C2H4combustion. In successive redox cycles, the lattice O of Bi2O3can be fully replenished without discernible changes in local Bi coordination or C2H2combustion selectivity. Heterolytic activation of C–H bonds across Bi–O sites and the higher acidity of C2H2results in lower barriers for C2H2activation than C2H4, enabling selective catalytic hydrocarbon combustion leveraging differences in molecular deprotonation energies."

To this end, we generated single-cell multiome and spatially resolved transcriptomics data of the chicken telencephalon. Enhancer codes of orthologous nonneuronal and γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) cell types show a high degree of similarity across amniotes, whereas excitatory neurons of the mammalian neocortex and avian pallium exhibit varying degrees of similarity.

We estimated the variability of stream network length for 14,765 gauged basins across the contiguous United States using measured streamflow distributions and topography-based estimates of how sensitive each stream network is to changing landscape wetness (the network’s elasticity). We find that the median US stream network is five times longer during annual high-flow conditions than during annual low-flow conditions.
