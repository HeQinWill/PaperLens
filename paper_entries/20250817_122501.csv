It analyses key regional events in Southern California, Northeast Amazonia, Pantanal-Chiquitano, and the Congo Basin, assessing their drivers, predictability, and attributing them to climate change and land use. Seasonal outlooks and decadal projections are provided. Climate change greatly increased the likelihood of these fires, and without strong mitigation, such events will become more frequent. 
 Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires globally, yet our understanding of these high-impact events remains uneven and shaped by media attention and regional research biases. The State of Wildfire Project systematically tracks and analyses global fire activity and this, its second annual report, covers the March 2024 to February 2025 fire season. During the 2024–25 fire season, fire-related carbon (C) emissions were totalled 2.2 Pg C, 9 % above average and the 6th highest on record since 2003, despite below-average global burned area (BA; 3.7 million km2). Extreme fire seasons in South America’s rainforests, dry forests and wetlands, and in Canada’s boreal forests pushed up the global C emissions total. Fire C emissions were over four times above average in Bolivia, three times above average in Canada, and ~50 % above average in Brazil and Venezuela. Wildfires in 2024–25 caused 100 fatalities in Nepal, 34 in South Africa, and 30 in Los Angeles, with additional fatalities reported in Canada, Côte d’Ivoire, Portugal, and Turkey. The Eaton and Palisades fires in Southern California caused 150,000 evacuations and US$140 billion in damages. Communities in Brazil, Bolivia, Southern California, and Northern India were exposed to fine particulate matter at concentrations 13–60 times WHO’s daily air quality standards. We evaluated the causes and predictability of four extreme wildfire episodes from the 2024–25 fire season, including in Northeast Amazonia (January–March 2024), the Pantanal-Chiquitano border regions of Brazil and Bolivia (July–September 2024), Southern California (January 2025), and the Congo Basin (July–August 2024). Anomalous weather created conditions for these regional extremes, while fuel availability and human ignitions shaped spatial patterns and temporal fire dynamics. In the three tropical regions, prolonged drought was the dominant fire enabler, whereas in California, extreme heat, wind, and antecedent fuel build-up were the dominant enablers. Our attribution analyses show that climate change made extreme fire weather in Northeast Amazonia 30–70 times more likely, increasing burned area roughly fourfold compared to a scenario without climate change. In the Pantanal–Chiquitano, fire weather was 4–5 times more likely, with up to 35-fold increases in burned area. In Southern California, climate change made larger burned area 89 % more likely, with burned area up to 25 times higher. The Congo Basin’s fire weather was 3–8 times more likely with climate change, with a 2.7-fold increase in burned area. Socioeconomic changes since the pre-industrial period, including land-use change, also likely increased burned area in Northeast Amazonia. Our models project that events on the scale of 2024–25 will become up to 57 %, 34 %, and 50 % more frequent than in the modern era in Northeast Amazonia, the Pantanal-Chiquitano, and the Congo Basin, respectively, under a middle-of-the-road scenario (SSP370). Climate action can limit the added risk, with frequency increases kept below 15 % in all three regions under a strong mitigation scenario (SSP126). In Southern California, the future trajectory of extreme fire likelihood remains highly uncertain due to poorly constrained climate-vegetation-fire interactions influencing fuel moisture, though our models suggest that risk may decline in future. This annual report from the State of Wildfires Project integrates and advances cutting-edge fire observations and modelling with regional expertise to track changing global wildfire hazard, guiding policy and practice towards improved preparedness, mitigation, adaptation, and societal benefit. Thirteen new datasets and model codebases presented in this work are available from the State of Wildfires Project’s Zenodo community (https://zenodo.org/communities/stateofwildfiresproject, last access: 11 August 2025)."

Large language models (LLMs) offer new solutions by mimicking the actors. We present InsNet-CRAFTY v1.0, a multi-LLM-agent model coupled with a land system model, simulating competing policy priorities. The model shows how LLM agents can simulate decision-making in institutional networks, highlighting both their potential and limitations in advancing land system modelling. 
 To foster sustainable land use and management, it is crucial – but challenging – to enhance our understanding of how policy interventions influence decision-making actors and how these interactions can be effectively modelled. Key challenges include endowing modelled actors with autonomy, accurately representing their relational network structures, and managing the often unstructured information exchange among them. Large language models (LLMs) offer new ways to address these challenges through the development of agents that are capable of mimicking reasoning, reflection, planning, and action. We present InsNet-CRAFTY (Institutional Network – Competition for Resources between Agent Functional Types) v1.0, a multi-LLM-agent model with a polycentric institutional framework coupled with an agent-based land system model. The institutional framework includes a high-level policymaking institution, two lobbyist organizations, two operational institutions, and two advisory agents. For exploratory purposes, illustrative numerical experiments simulating two competing policy priorities are conducted: increasing meat production versus expanding protected areas for nature conservation. We find that the high-level institution tends to avoid radical changes in budget allocations and adopts incremental policy goals for the operational institutions, but it leaves an unresolved budget deficit in one institution and a surplus in another. This is due to the competing influence of multiple stakeholders, which leads to the emergence of a path-dependent decision-making approach. Despite errors in information and behaviours by the LLM agents, the network maintains overall behavioural believability. The results highlight both the potential and the risks of using LLM agents to simulate policy decision-making. While LLM agents demonstrate high flexibility and autonomy in modelling human decision-making and institutional dynamics, their integration with existing land use models is complex, requiring careful workflow design to ensure reliability. These insights contribute to advancing land system modelling and the broader field of institutional analysis, providing new tools and methodologies for researchers and policymakers."

To comprehensively assess pharmaceutical pollution in rivers, we developed a spatially resolved model to predict pharmaceutical concentrations and associated ecological risks across 1 km river stretches in Saxony, Germany. We focused on five pharmaceuticals: two antiepileptics (carbamazepine, gabapentin), two antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole), and one antidiabetic (metformin); and their toxicity to three aquatic species: algae, daphnia, and fish. Model evaluation demonstrated a good level of accuracy, with 95–100% of simulations aligning within 1 order of magnitude of observed values across spatial and temporal scales (2008–2014). Pharmaceutical-wise, low environmental concentrations led to a reduced performance of ciprofloxacin, whereas frequent observations of carbamazepine demonstrated its improved model skill. Further, ecological risk assessments for single toxicity indicated significant risks in over half of the Saxon rivers, with exposure frequencies reaching up to 80% for the analyzed pharmaceuticals. For mixture toxicity, the risk frequency increased to 99%, revealing widespread ecotoxicological risks. Our framework identifies transport trajectories and risk hotspots of pharmaceutical pollution, enabling spatiotemporal predictions under global change conditions to support proactive measures for a healthier planet."

Parisek;Jonathan A. Walter;Steve Sadro;Andrew L. Rypel,Velocity of Climate Change and the Vulnerability of Mountain Lake Landscapes,"Freshwater ecosystems in mountain landscapes are threatened by climate change. Accumulated heat can result in lethal short-term heat exposure, while velocity of change governs severity and rates of long-term heat exposure. Here, we novelly integrate heat accumulation and velocity of change approaches to classify climate-vulnerable USA mountain watersheds. We combine watershed position and air temperature data to calculate degree-days. We then calculate the current velocity of this change and used discriminant function analyses to classify watershed vulnerability through 2100. Our results demonstrate how rates of heat accumulation are increasing across mountain landscapes. We estimate 19% of watersheds are at greatest vulnerability to accumulated heat, and this will increase to 33% by 2100. Further, mean killing degree days (i.e., region-specific mean number of days above 90th temperature percentile) are projected to increase 215–254% (mean = 236%) over this same time frame. Together, results indicate heat accumulation will increase substantially over the next 75 years; changes are projected to be most severe in lower elevation landscapes and those with greatest historical velocity of change. These changes will likely restructure species’ distributions. Decision-makers can use these classifications to better understand landscapes, species’ needs, and ecosystem services, thereby enabling effective allocation of conservation resources."

This work investigates the effect of PEG reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (•OH), an important environmental oxidant, on the molecular weight (MW) distribution of PEGs and their subsequent biodegradation in soil and sediment. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated a pronounced decrease in the PEG MW after only a few •OH-reaction-induced chain scissions on initial PEG molecules. The simulation results were validated by experimentally reacting 13C-labeled PEGs (M¯n = 6380 ± 400 Da) with photochemically produced •OH to three extents and by analyzing the formed low MW PEG reaction products. Incubation of unreacted and •OH-reacted PEGs in both a sediment and a soil over 150 days demonstrated increasing rates and extents of PEG biodegradation into 13CO2 with increasing •OH-reaction extent and thus increasing amounts of low MW PEG products. This work underscores the importance of considering WSP MW distributions and dynamics caused by biotic or abiotic chain scission reactions when advancing a detailed understanding of WSP fate and biodegradability in natural and engineered receiving environments."

Continuous absorption for 480 min indicated the feasibility of TBAB for repeated use. Moreover, we propose an antioxidant mechanism, including the capture of SO3•– by TBA+, and the reduction of SO3•– by Br–. The successive steps kept the sulfite from the cyclic depletion of the radical chain reaction of “Generate SO3•–-Introducing O2–Consuming SO32–” due to O2.

In many Asian countries, however, the extent of plasticizer exposure among children is poorly understood despite the increasing use of plasticizers. This study compared plasticizer exposure levels and risks among children in four Asian countries and investigated the major risk drivers. Children aged 6–14 years old were recruited between 2022 and 2023 from Korea (n = 89), Thailand (n = 111), Indonesia (n = 100), and Bangladesh (n = 100). They were measured for major metabolites of phthalates and nonphthalate plasticizers in the first morning void urine. Indonesian and Bangladeshi children showed higher exposure to phthalates but lower exposure to nonphthalate alternatives. At the same time, children from Thailand and Korea exhibited a greater transition to the alternatives. In all countries, DEHA contributed to over 80% of the total estimated daily intake (EDI) for all plasticizers. Bangladeshi children exhibited 1.5–2 times greater total plasticizer exposure than the children of the other countries across all EDI quartiles. Among the high-risk subgroup (within the top 25th percentile of the hazard index), DEHP accounted for 62 and 52% of the cumulative risk in Indonesia and Bangladesh, while DnBP contributed to 63 and 54% in Thailand and Korea, respectively.

Understanding water or solvent transport in membrane pores is essential for advancing membrane separation technologies. A key question in transport modeling is to establish a relationship between solvent permeability and membrane porous structure properties, such as porosity or pore size. The nano- and subnanometer pores in polymeric membranes such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes are highly tortuous and dynamically connected, which challenges the conventional methods of transport modeling. This study addresses this challenge by developing a theoretical framework to describe solvent transport through membranes with dynamic and disordered porous structure. Specifically, we propose a lattice model to describe the pore network, while preserving the viscous nature of solvent permeation. We further establish a relationship between solvent permeability and membrane porosity or pore size, which is validated by molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data. By integrating this relationship into the solution-friction model, we define pore connectivity and local friction coefficient to quantify the impact of pore structure on solvent permeability. Our analysis highlights the dominant influence of pore connectivity on the permeability of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes, particularly when the pore size approaches the dimensions of solvent molecules. Overall, this study provides critical insights into water and solvent transport mechanisms in nanoporous membranes, opening the door for strategies to substantially enhance membrane performance."

Extending the lifespan of concrete is highly efficient in achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Biomineralization for concrete corrosion inhibition (BCCI) was previously proposed and demonstrated to effectively protect marine concrete in laboratory experiments, showing promise for decarbonization due to potentially increased lifespans. The potential of BCCI for decarbonization and sustainability warrants further investigation. Therefore, this study evaluated its impact on GHG emissions for insights into global decarbonization. Field corrosion experiments were conducted to ascertain its effectiveness as a valuable GHG calculation input, including biofilm community analysis and microstructure and macroscopic measurements of concrete. Results show that BCCI decreased the total/relative abundances of corrosive bacteria, inhibited sulfate and chloride diffusion, and enhanced carbon functions, irrespective of concrete type. Moreover, BCCI significantly reduced GHG emissions, particularly in 20 MPa concrete. BCCI demonstrated substantial GHG mitigation potential in China, Indonesia, and the USA, which enabled a competitive 37–65% reduction in global GHG from producing underwater concrete. In the long term, this strategy would yield more sustainable development benefits.

Despite fish being a major source of aquatic protein for humans, no study has yet addressed how to reduce the risk of human exposure to MPs when consuming fish. This study investigated 1,075 fish from 37 species across representative fishing areas, and the presence of MPs in various tissues, such as the gills, guts, and muscles, was analyzed to assess fish food safety comprehensively. MPs (particles >20 μm in size) were detected in 36.28% of the gills and 39.63% of the guts but were not detected in muscle tissues. Compared with those from deeper waters, the fish from upper layers presented greater MP abundances and smaller average sizes. A significant negative correlation was detected between the abundance of MPs in fish and their length and weight. The global per capita MP consumption from captured fish, including all tissues and muscles, is approximately 5.60 × 104 items/year. To minimize dietary exposure to MPs, humans should prioritize consuming only fish muscle and selecting fish from deeper waters and larger sizes whenever possible. Future efforts to optimize fish consumption patterns should involve systematically evaluating the combined risks of MPs and other pollutants, considering both the nutritional value and health benefits of fish consumption and adopting sustainable fishery management approaches."

As a central part of the global N cycle, soil N supply from net N mineralization (NNM) and net nitrification (NN) contributes to over 50% of crop N uptake. However, how global land use changes impact soil N supply and potential N loss remains elusive. By compiling a global data set of 1,782 paired observations from 185 publications, we show that land use conversion from natural to managed ecosystems significantly reduced NNM by 7.5% (−11.5, −2.8%) and increased NN by 150% (86, 194%), indicating decreasing N availability while increasing potential N loss through denitrification and nitrate leaching. In contrast, reversing managed to natural ecosystems significantly increased NNM by 20% (9.7, 25.4%) and decreased NN by 89% (−125, −46%), indicating increasing N availability while decreasing potential N loss. Structural equation modeling revealed that land use change induced changes in soil properties, including organic matter content, bulk density, microbial biomass and pH, and anthropogenic activities, including application of ammonium-based fertilizers and manure, were the most important factors regulating NNM and NN. The land use change effect was the strongest in tropical and subtropical regions, where NNM was negatively affected and NN positively affected by land use change. Our findings indicate that increasing soil organic matter content and enhancing soil structural development post land use change can boost soil N supply and reduce the risk for N loss."

Routes with notably low emissions are identified, such as biomass and biofuel utilization with carbon capture and storage (CCS), natural gas reforming with CCS, waste-derived hydrogen, and renewable energy-driven electrolysis. In contrast, biological routes show high variability, with some among the highest emitters. Background energy sources and feedstock composition are identified as key influencing factors. Additionally, 53 routes with emissions lower than steam methane reforming (SMR) are analyzed for substitution factors and levelized costs of GHG mitigation, with 17 routes emerging as promising options for GHG reduction, particularly those utilizing waste or biomass with CCS.

A previously unexplored source of grime reactivity is environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), which are precursors to reactive oxygen species (ROS). To measure EPFRs in grime, grime was collected in Spring 2023 on glass beads deployed in suburban North Carolina, where possible primary EPFR sources include pollen and nearby prescribed burning. EPFRs are measured in all collected grime samples via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy after extraction of the grime onto filters. Pollen contains the majority of the collected grime mass, and when isolated from the smaller component of the grime constituents via filtration, it comprises most of the measured EPFRs. Endogenous EPFRs were measured in commercial pollen samples (Quercus rubra, Quercus velutina, and Betula pendula), which supports the conclusion that pollen contributed to the overall EPFRs measured in the grime. Grime samples were collected under shaded conditions, which limits photochemistry as a secondary source of EPFRs in the field samples; to further investigate light mediated EPFR formation mechanisms, we also measured EPFRs in grime following laboratory photoaging. EPFRs are formed from irradiation in all grime samples; however, extended irradiation eventually reduces the number of EPFRs to their starting numbers, a trend which was also observed with the irradiation of the commercial pollen. The increase of EPFRs over grime age and with irradiation implies that ROS production in grime from EPFRs may also be sensitive to aging over time."

This study integrated wearable temperature sensors with a high-resolution (1 km, hourly) ambient temperature model to evaluate individual-level ambient exposure among 94 individuals in Connecticut, USA, monitored across seasons between October 2023 and January 2025. Personal temperature was consistently higher than ambient temperature, with a larger difference during cooler months. The hourly difference exhibited a distinct unimodal diurnal pattern, smallest in the early afternoon. Linear mixed-effects models identified ambient temperature, hour of day, month, solar radiation, and the nightlight index as the key predictors of personal temperature and its deviation from ambient conditions. The temperature difference was well characterized by the model (marginal R2 of 0.854). Extreme gradient boosting with SHapley Additive Explanations confirmed the ambient temperature and hour of day as the most influential features, with albedo and other environmental factors showing smaller effects.

Heat waves over Middle Europe are classified into four types based on their vertical cross‐sections of temperature anomalies. We show that most reanalysis‐driven CORDEX RCMs tend to overclassify heat waves as lower‐tropospheric at the expense of the other types. This bias is linked to overly frequent southerly advection that is too warm compared to the ERA5 reanalysis especially at the 850 hPa level, pointing to a weaker temperature gradient between the 2 m and 850 hPa levels. We also find substantial differences among the RCMs in frequencies of near‐ground and vertically extensive heat wave types, which are partially attributed to simulated characteristics of easterly advection. This suggests strong relationships between land–atmosphere coupling and those heat wave types in which near‐ground temperature anomalies are important."

 As continental rifts evolve towards lithospheric break-up and the formation of an ocean ridge, basaltic dyke intrusion becomes the dominant mechanism of upper-crustal extension, surpassing tectonic faulting. The magmatic architecture within the rifting crust, which governs the availability and pathways of ascending magmas, therefore has a crucial role in the transition from continental- to oceanic-style rifting. Here we use olivine Fe–Mg interdiffusion chronometry to constrain the dynamics and timescales of magma ascent beneath the Main Ethiopian Rift, a continental rift of intermediate tectonic maturity. We find that magmas move rapidly through the crust, replenishing mid-crustal reservoirs only weeks to months before intrusive-eruptive events. Such ascent timescales are comparable to those of dyke intrusion recurrence observed during active phases at more mature rifts; hence, we infer that extensional activity in the Main Ethiopian Rift is probably mediated by the supply of magma from depth. The magmatic architecture and magma ascent rates we propose for the Main Ethiopian Rift indicate that well-established magma plumbing systems, capable of efficiently delivering melts to feed upper-crustal dykes, can develop in a continental rift even before substantial lithospheric thinning has occurred.

Here, we report the design of thiazole-based homologous heteropolyaromatic COFs (TTT-COF) via post-cyclization reaction for photocatalytic H2O2 production and aerobic oxidation of C(sp3)-H bonds.

Consequently, TTT-COF achieves a photosynthetic H2O2 production rate of 29.9 mmol g−1 h−1 with more than 200 hours of long-term stability when employing 10 % benzyl alcohol (V/V) as a sacrificial agent.

As part of a reverse pharmacology approach, we here investigated the anti-diabetic potential of PNe and its bioactive compounds to alleviate insulin resistance in diet-induced obese, male mice. Dietary supplementation with PNe improves insulin sensitivity and promotes glucose uptake into adipose depots. In vitro, PNe triggers glucose disposal into murine and human adipocytes by upregulating Glut1 expression through PKC-ERK1/2 signaling.

This work highlights a new super-gravity strategy to achieve a high thermoelectric performance, which may be applicable to other thermoelectric materials. The authors develop a super-gravity field remelting fabrication technology which is effective in synergistically optimizing the electrical and thermal transport properties.

 Activation of classical and lectin complement pathways contributes to several human diseases. Empasiprubart is a humanized recycling monoclonal antibody that inhibits both pathways by binding to the CCP2 domain of complement factor 2 (C2), an interaction that is dependent on both Ca2+ and pH. Here, we resolve the crystal structure of empasiprubart complexed with C2, providing the molecular basis of its Ca2+ dependency, and report a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and tolerability (primary objectives) in addition to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity (secondary objectives) of empasiprubart in 78 healthy participants (NCT04532125). A single intravenous (IV) dose of empasiprubart reduces circulating C2 levels by up to 99% and dose-dependently inhibits the classical and lectin pathways. Multiple IV empasiprubart doses reinforce reductions in free C2 levels, which persist until the endpoint of the study at 41 weeks. This prolonged reduction is in line with the empasiprubart elimination half-life (70–88 days). Single and multiple ascending doses of empasiprubart are generally safe and well tolerated. Overall, our results reveal in atomic detail the mechanism of empasiprubart and demonstrate that it is a first-in-class anti-C2 therapeutic antibody for use in complement-mediated diseases.

 To evaluate the path of anthropogenic mercury (Hg) from Asia to the Pacific Ocean, we report mercury stable isotopes in zooplankton from the East China Sea to the Bay of Bengal, and in the Philippine Sea and the Central Pacific. Here, we find that zooplankton mercury concentration decreases and δ202Hg and Δ199Hg increase with distances away from Asia, depicting anthropogenic mercury dilution. Anomalies of even mass-number isotopes (Δ200Hg), used to decipher between near-surface and tropospheric oxidation, suggest that 40–48% of anthropogenic Hg(0) is initially oxidized at the marine boundary layer or via terrestrial vegetation, and >50% of anthropogenic Hg(0) is circulated to the upper atmosphere for oxidation and removal to the Pacific. The fact that both near-surface and atmospheric Hg(0) oxidation supplies bioavailable Hg(II) strengthens the case for mitigating Hg(0) emissions. Recently reported climate-projected increase in riverine mercury fluxes may also benefit by reducing anthropogenic Hg(0) available for vegetative uptake.

 Hydroclimatic whiplash rapid shifts between drought and flood poses growing risks to U.S. communities. Here, we assess historical extremes and future projections using a normalized streamflow metric: the annual mean flow’s deviation from the 1981–2020 average, expressed as a fraction of that average. This metric is applied to United States Geological Survey records and Localized Constructed Analogs downscaled projections under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. Results reveal sharp regional disparities, with drought deficits exceeding 300% of normal flow during multi-year droughts. By linking hydrologic outcomes with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Risk Index, we find that counties facing the deepest droughts also experience the highest annual losses and lowest resilience. Under the high-emissions scenario, sustained surpluses emerge only in already resilient regions. These findings highlight the urgent need for region-specific, adaptive water management to protect vulnerable populations from worsening climate extremes.

 In the Western United States, water supply forecasting has traditionally relied on snow water equivalent measurements at ground-based stations due to their strong correlations with streamflow volume during spring and summer. However, stations are sparse and sample a small area, prompting interest in spatially complete – but costly – basin-wide mapping from airborne surveys or future satellite missions. Here we show that adding strategic measurements at snow hotspots – localized areas with untapped information for predicting streamflow – consistently outperforms spatially complete surveys that provide basin-average snowpack, both in basins with and without existing stations. While both improve forecast skill, hotspot monitoring increases correlations with streamflow volume by 11-14% (median) across 390 basins, compared to 4% from basin-wide surveys. These findings hold across snowpack datasets, skill metrics, and statistical models. The greatest gains in water supply prediction come from leveraging existing stations and expanding snow measurements to the right places, rather than everywhere.

 Ecological restoration of fragile drylands involves complex benefit-cost trade-offs. While Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) provides a foundational framework for this task, its large-scale application in drylands often fails to adequately integrate critical hydrological impacts, notably ecosystem water consumption. Here, we developed and applied an integrated SCP framework to optimize spatial prioritization for ecological restoration in China’s drylands. This framework explicitly integrates water cost, calculated as increased ecosystem evapotranspiration via the Budyko model, and economic costs based on statistical data. It also assessed benefits, including habitat increases for 3,005 species and enhanced biomass carbon sequestration. Our proposed integrated pathway minimizes water cost while ensuring cost-effectiveness, on average, achieving 81.0% of the maximum potential biomass carbon sequestration and 88.1% of the maximum potential habitat area increases. Compared to scenarios focusing solely on economic costs, this approach reduces the average cumulative water cost by 27.0% and the maximum cumulative water cost by 91.1%. This stark contrast demonstrates that focusing on economics alone leads to misaligned spatial restoration priorities, underscoring the necessity of integrating ecosystem water consumption into dryland SCP. Our findings not only establishe a decision-making foundation for China but also offer a generalizable multi-criteria framework for cost-effective dryland restoration worldwide.

 Urban trees play a crucial role in delivering ecosystem services, yet their structural complexity poses significant challenges for remote sensing. Although recent large-scale, open-access canopy height models (CHMs) offer potential alternatives to airborne LiDAR, their suitability for urban environments remains uncertain. This study systematically evaluated four prominent CHMs (Potapov, Lang, Tolan, and Malambo) using high-resolution airborne LiDAR data from Washington, D.C., with complementary analyses from four additional cities. We assessed their performance in both canopy classification and height prediction using classification and regression metrics, spatial autocorrelation, consistency tests, and explainable machine learning. Results revealed consistent limitations across products, including widespread misclassification of canopy, systematic tree height prediction biases — characterized by overestimation of low and underestimation of high canopies (the OLUH effect) — and pronounced spatial clustering of errors along urban–forest edges. Among the models, only the Lang CHM passed the Bland–Altman consistency test, showing marginal statistical agreement with reference data. Tree characteristic variables, especially canopy height itself, emerged as dominant drivers of height errors, while topography and built-up context also contributed. Consistent patterns observed across four additional cities indicated that these limitations are systemic rather than location-specific. We conclude that high-precision airborne LiDAR remains essential for urban forestry and recommend enhancing canopy height mapping techniques to better capture the structure of urban trees. A promising direction is the development of urban-specific CHMs with finer spatial and temporal resolution, improved temporal consistency, and integration with high-resolution imagery, contextual deep learning models, and local calibration strategies."

 Accurate and timely building damage assessment (BDA) is critical for effective disaster response and recovery. However, existing machine learning approaches in this context do mostly not account for uncertainties, which are essential for ensuring trustworthy and transparent results. This study introduces a hybrid Bayesian deep learning framework with integrated uncertainty quantification to enhance BDA, thereby making model predictions more reliable and interpretable. We propose BayeSiamMTL, a novel Bayesian Siamese multitask learning architecture that combines deterministic segmentation of building footprints with probabilistic change detection for damage level classification. By encoding model parameters as probability distributions and utilizing variational inference with Monte Carlo approximation, BayeSiamMTL produces pixelwise posterior predictive distributions, providing detailed insights into both damage predictions and their associated uncertainties. Our analysis explores key aspects of Bayesian modeling and, to our knowledge, is the first to provide quantified insights into the model’s classification dynamics, revealing internal decision-making tendencies and sources of uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce confidence-informed damage maps in the form of stratified probabilities of damage clusters and minimum/maximum damage extents delineated from confidence intervals. Model performance is evaluated across multiple datasets to assess the impact of domain shifts and out-of-distribution samples. Experimental results show that BayeSiamMTL not only achieves a performance advantage over its deterministic counterpart but also exhibits significantly better generalization capabilities under domain shifts with a relative performance improvement of 42 %. While background pixels represent the primary source of confusion across all damage levels, our findings indicate that building destructions are more frequently confused with intact buildings rather than among varying degrees of damage."

 Estimating room layout from panoramas is a new trend in the holistic reconstruction of the 3D environment. However, a single panorama is easily occluded by walls and furniture, making it hard to reconstruct the whole indoor room accurately and completely. Besides, deep learning room layout estimating methods often perform poorly in unseen scenes. To address this need, this paper proposes an accurate room layout estimation method from multi-view panoramas with multi-label graph cut. The proposed method takes full advantage of each panorama by utilizing multi-label graph cut. First, room layouts of each panorama are estimated with pre-trained deep-learning models and projected to the ground as the labels; then, a geometry-aware ray-casting method is utilized to obtain the initial floorplan; next, the initial floorplan is regularized by multi-label graph cut with the estimated labels from each panorama; in the end, the final layouts of each panorama is obtained by transforming the regularized floorplans and estimated ceiling heights into layouts with panorama geometry. Experiments in the recently released multi-view panoramas dataset show that the proposed method can regularize the initial floorplan to a floorplan with accurate geometry. Furthermore, the accuracy of the layouts surpassed the layout estimation accuracy of the single panorama deep learning models (HorizonNet and LGTNet) and the state-of-the-art self-training layout estimation models with multi-view panoramas by a large margin."

 Solar radiation can be a potential source of cost-effective and sustainable energy, offering the promise of a clean and safe environment in the East African region. However, reliable solar radiation data remain limited, hindering accurate assessment of the available solar potential and characterisation of the local and regional climate. To address this issue, this study used in situ measurements from 11 ground-based meteorological stations to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the satellite-derived solar radiation product, SARAH-3, across Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Rwanda. Statistical distribution, degree of linear association, explanatory strength, infra-daily, daily, and seasonal cycles were used to assess the degree of similarity. Our findings revealed a significant agreement between surface reference data and SARAH-3 Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) data and a significant linear association between bias and the Orographic Complexity Index (OCI) of the neighbour area of the observation points with Pearson’s correlation coefficients (R) of −0.53. At half-hour resolution, in situ measurements and satellite-based solar radiation data revealed high R values, ranging from 0.70 to 0.92, with significant explanatory capacity between 54% and 86%. Percentage bias (PB) was markedly lower than 5% for most stations, except in Rwanda, where PB reached 25%. The distributions of the data sets were generally skewed in the same direction, with a slight difference. Linear association and explanatory capacity improved significantly on the daily time scale, with R exceeding 0.90 and coefficients of determination greater than 78% at all stations. Furthermore, PB and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were generally low on the monthly scale, except in Rwanda, particularly in Mukarange, where they reached 24.61% and 42.92, respectively.

 This study employs the WRF-based RMAPS-ST numerical weather prediction model to conduct 1-km resolution simulations of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games on February 2022. An inter-comparison of the SH, the SMS and the IUM scale-aware PBL schemes is conducted. The performance of YSU as a traditional PBL scheme is also evaluated as a baseline. The investigation focuses on their ability to forecast over three distinct competition areas, Beijing (BJ), Yanqing (YQ), and Zhangjiakou (ZJK), each characterized by different terrain. The results reveal that the IUM and SMS schemes generally outperform the YSU and the SH schemes, particularly in the BJ area, where IUM exhibits the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) for 2-m temperature and 10-m wind speed. In YQ, with its complex topography, there are no significant discrepancies among the schemes, while SMS improves wind speed forecasts in ZJK. An abrupt nocturnal warming and a gusty wind case are chosen to further demonstrate the performance in all schemes. Results show that IUM scheme can reproduce these two cases, attributed to its stronger turbulence mixing length. These findings underscore the importance of scale-aware PBL schemes in improving high-resolution weather forecasts and diverse meteorological conditions. The IUM scheme, in particular, emerges as a promising tool for future numerical weather prediction applications."

10.1126/sciadv.adw4693,False,Science Advances,该论文主要介绍了一种用于复杂天然产物（CNPs）结构注释的自动化方法，即基于模块化碎片化的结构组装（MFSA）策略。该方法通过将结构分解为碎片，利用伪库识别目标，并使用特征离子和中性丢失重组结构。论文以daphnane类二萜为例进行了验证，并开发了一个名为CNPs-MFSA的Python应用程序。该应用在daphnane类化合物的注释方面优于其他软件。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系，主要关注天然产物的结构鉴定。,[],Mi Zhang;Kouharu Otsuki;Lingjian Tan;Takashi Kikuchi;Ning Li;Wei Li,Automated annotation of complex natural products using a modular fragmentation–based structure assembly (MFSA) strategy,"Complex natural products (CNPs) feature polycyclic structures, multiple consecutive chiral centers, and nonrepetitive structural units. Given their complexity, the structural annotation of CNPs remains a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce the modular fragmentation–based structural assembly (MFSA) strategy for the target CNP structural annotation. The MFSA strategy disassembled the structure based on fragmentation patterns, recognized targets via a pseudo-library, and reassembled the structure using characteristic ions and neutral losses. As a proof of concept, we focused on daphnane-type diterpenoids, a kind of specific bioactive CNP from Thymelaeaceae plants. Furthermore, we present a user-friendly application named CNPs-MFSA coded in Python. Using an in-house daphnane library, CNPs-MFSA outperformed SIRIUS, MS-FINDER, and MetFrag in Top-1 annotation accuracy. By applying CNPs-MFSA to 56 Thymelaeaceae plants, 204 high-confidence daphnanes within 822 annotated results, including 105 previously unreported compounds were found. Aconitine, paclitaxel, and obakunone analogs were incorporated as additional target CNP classes to illustrate the extension workflow."

However, evidence from early archaeological sites indicates relatively short-distance stone transport dynamics similar to behaviors observed in nonhuman primates. Here we report selective raw material transport over longer distances than expected at least 2.6 million years ago. Hominins at Nyayanga, Kenya, manufactured Oldowan tools primarily from diverse nonlocal stones, pushing back the date for expanded raw material transport by over half a million years. Nonlocal cobbles were transported up to 13 kilometers for on-site reduction, resulting in assemblage patterns inconsistent with accumulations formed by repeated short-distance transport events. These findings demonstrate that early toolmakers moved stones over substantial distances, possibly in anticipation of food processing needs, representing the earliest archaeologically visible signal for the incorporation of lithic technology into landscape-scale foraging repertoires."
